She was the vicar of the Imatra parish from 1986 to 2010.[1]\nBorn in Lappeenranta as the seventh of eight children, she entered the faculty of theology at the University of Helsinki in 1973. She has been married twice, and has three children.[2]\nIn November 2008, Aalto came out as trans woman and announced her intent to have a sex reassignment surgery. This caused a great controversy in the Church. The bishop of Mikkeli, Voitto Huotari, commented that there is no juridical obstacle for Aalto continuing as a vicar, but that there will be problems.[1]\nIn 2009, almost 600 members left the Imatra parish.[3] In November 2009, Aalto returned to the job of vicar after spending a year on leave. In March 2010, she requested to be allowed to resign, due in part to the discrimination she faced.[2][4]\nShe was elected the notary of diocese for Kuopio by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 2010.[2]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Juhani Saarinen. \"Kirkkoherra odotti vuosikymmeni\u00e4 muutosta miehest\u00e4 naiseksi - HS.fi - Kotimaa\".

Addams and James coached Felicity Huffman for her Academy Award-nominated performance as a transgender woman in the film Transamerica.[7]\nAt the Sundance debut of Soldier's Girl, Addams met Jane Fonda, whose son Troy Garity had played Winchell. Fonda suggested Addams mount an all-transgender production of The Vagina Monologues.[5] The production was to contribute funds and help raise awareness of violence against women; it became the subject of the 2006 documentary film Beautiful Daughters.[8]\nA reality television series entitled Transamerican Love Story, featuring Addams choosing among eight suitors, debuted February 11, 2008 on Logo TV.\nIn April 2008, Addams performed alongside Fonda, Glenn Close, Salma Hayek, Alicia Keys, and others in a tenth-anniversary production of The Vagina Monologues at the Louisiana Superdome.[5][9]\nIn May 2008, PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) chose Addams as PFLAG's spokesperson for their educational campaign, This Is Our Love Story.[10] Addams said, \"I hope This Is Our Love Story will help young transgender people as they come out. By seeing the happy, confident woman I've become, I hope I can act as a role model for these young people at a critical moment in their development.\"[11] Addams writes a blog on gender issues for Psychology Today.[12]\nAddams has released a single entitled \"Stunning\", available on iTunes. Addams co-produced the song \"The Vagina Song\" by Willam Belli, from his debut album The Wreckoning, and made a cameo in the song's music video.[13][14]\nIn 2015, Addams appeared in the international premiere of \"Trans Scripts\"[15] a new play by Paul Lucas at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland.  The production received 24 four- and five-star reviews, a Fringe First Award,[16][17][18] a High Commendation from Amnesty International [19] and was shortlisted for the Feminist Fest Award, the Best of Edinburgh Award, and the Holden Street Theater Award.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1999, while working as a performer, Addams began dating PFC Barry Winchell. Word of the relationship spread at Winchell's Army base where he was harassed by fellow soldiers and ultimately murdered.[20] Winchell's murder and the subsequent trial resulted in widespread press[4] and a formal review of the U.S. \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" (DADT) military policy, ordered by President Bill Clinton.[21][22][23] The case became a prominent example used to illustrate the failure of DADT to protect LGBT service members.[4] Addams' and Winchell's romance and the crimes of their abusers are depicted in the film Soldier's Girl, released in 2003. Addams was portrayed by Lee Pace. A subsequent The New York Times article, \"An Inconvenient Woman\", documented the marginalization and misrepresentation of transgender sexuality even by gay rights activists.[4][24]\n\nWorks[edit]\nCalpernia Addams, Mark 947: A Life Shaped by God, Gender, and Force of Will (Writers Club Press, 2002).

To her, these problems are unacceptable under international laws of human rights.[7] She was motivated to take a role in her government in response to political activists being arrested in Venezuela.[8] In 2014, there were many protests regarding the democratic and economic conditions of the time. In response to these protests, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered for the arrest of political protesters. According to Foro Penal, over 13,000 people have been arrested since 2014 because of protests relating to the Venezuelan government.[9]\nTamara graduated from Andr\u00e9s Bello Catholic University in 1976. She then went on to obtain her doctorate in law with high honors from University of Paris II Panth\u00e9on-Assas in 1982. She also earned a diploma in comparative law from the Paris Institute of Comparative Law in 1982. In 2016, Adri\u00e1n completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow.\n\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT rights in Venezuela\nList of the first LGBT holders of political offices\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Tamara Adri\u00e1n se convierte en la primera diputada transg\u00e9nero en la historia de Venezuela\".

From a young age\u2014\u201csince the age of three, four, five, six\u201d\u2014she knew she was a woman, played with dolls, cross dressed, and was in touch with her feminine side.[6][7] She feels people should not be defined by gender.[8] She was shy, and bullied throughout childhood.[9] As a teen, Alves had a hormone dysfunction, with too much estrogen  causing breast tissue to grow; his other features were also picked on by the bullies.[9][7] Her family has a string of grocery stores in Brazil which has made them wealthy, but as of 2018, Alves did not get any of those monies.[10]\nAlves moved to London at age nineteen, where she studied public relations at London College of Communication.[3][4] Her money comes from an inheritance her maternal grandparents left for her.[5]\n\nBiography[edit]\nAlves has had several surgeries, including nose jobs which resulted in the loss of her sense of smell.[9] Soon after that experience she underwent a surgery in Brazil to inject a gel into the arms to make them look more muscular.[9] She lost use of both her arms for a while and the experience compelled her to seek psychotherapy.[9] In 2013 Alves was diagnosed with body dysmorphia \u2014 a \u201cmental health condition where a person spends an obsessive amount of time worrying about flaws in their appearance\u201d.[9]\nAs of 2018, Alves has luxury homes in London Marbella, Spain, and was a regular presenter on television.[5][10] She has a sizable monthly pension from her grandparents, and is heir to properties in Puerto Ban\u00fas in Spain that she rents out to tourists.[5] Her net worth in 2018 was estimated at over \u00a330 million.[5] In 2018 Alves was jetting between London and Brazil for work and found that being recognized everywhere\u2014and being asked for selfies\u2014had its downside, and felt a new freedom when cross dressing as Jessica.[10] The idea of transitioning gender identity, outwardly, to permanently being female was put on hold, in part because of objections from her father.[10]\nAs of January 2018, Alves has spent just over \u00a3500,000 (equivalent to $512,784 in 2019) undergoing 103 cosmetic procedures, including injections, 51 of which were plastic surgeries.[11][3] Alves has undergone liposuction, had gel filler injected into shoulders, biceps, and triceps, applies minoxidil topically, has had hair implants and a number of facelifts, wears tinted contact lenses, and has had twelve rhinoplasties.[4] Her first plastic surgery was at the age of 17 to remove gynecomastia.[4] Her first nose job was when she was nineteen, As of March\u00a02020[update] she has spent an estimated  \u00a3650,000 on sixty operations to emulate the iconic Barbie doll.[12] Alves recounted that pre-transition she tried to compensate for her lack of masculine tendencies by trying to look more so through the surgeries, \"I'd always felt feminine and when I struggled to be manly with my personality, I decided to make my appearance as masculine as possible instead, ... But no matter how much I looked like Ken nothing eased the pain of being Barbie inside.\"[12]\nIn August 2018, Alves appeared on the UK television show Celebrity Big Brother as a celebrity housemate. After using the racial slur \"nigger\" in a conversation over the type of sexual partner she preferred, Alves was given a \"final warning\" by producers that if she repeated the language she would be evicted from the house. The incident garnered over 1,000 complaints to regulator OfCom.[13] After another incident, Alves was expelled from the show in the early hours of the morning on the tenth day.[14][15]\nIn March 2019, Alves released a song with Italian plastic surgeon Giacomo Urtis called \"Plastic World\".[16]\nIn January 2020, Alves came out as transgender after three months of living in privacy.[17] She shared that she had always been depressed and felt that as risky as more surgeries were, she needed to transition or she would die.[6][18] During the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic she was separated from her family but reunited with them in June.[6] In July 2020, Alves announced that she had changed her name to Jessica.[19] In August her father died. He was always worried about Jessica dying from a surgery, but they remained close throughout her life.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Allcock, Beth (20 August 2018). \"Who is Celebrity Big Brother 2018's the Human Ken Doll Rodrigo Alves?\".

She attached a colloquial ca to the end of Eddie so that it sounded like Eddieca and formed the name Erica.[6] Consequently, she became Erica Salazar.[7] Beginning around 1989\u20131990, she took on the stage name Erica Hutton.[5][8] She named herself after Lauren Hutton, whom she admired.[5] After she met Tandi Andrews, who became her drag mother and mentor,[1][5] she changed her stage name to Erica Hutton Andrews and subsequently to Erica Andrews.\nAndrews was born into a family with two older brothers and a younger sister.[2][9] During her childhood, her father was sentenced to ten years in prison for a drug offense.[10] Andrews spent her childhood in Allende through the age of 8, when her mother and siblings crossed the border and settled in Laredo, Texas.[2] Though Andrews maintained a relationship with her mother and siblings, she became estranged from her father and never saw him again.

A transsexual man,[2] he received the 2007 AVN Award as Transsexual Performer of the Year; he now works as an advocate, educator, lecturer, and writer. Angel served on the Board of Directors of the Woodhull Freedom Foundation[3][4][5][6] from 2010 to 2016; the foundation works to affirm sexual freedom as a fundamental human right through advocacy and education.[7]\n\nContents\n\n1 Earlier years\n2 Gender transition\n3 Adult film career\n4 Educational work\n5 Other activities\n6 Personal life\n7 Awards and nominations\n8 Partial filmography\n\n8.1 Adult films\n8.2 Documentaries\n8.3 Mainstream media\n\n\n9 References\n10 External links\n\n10.1 Interviews\n10.2 Documentaries\n\n\n\n\nEarlier years[edit]\nAngel was born in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, California[8] assigned female and given a feminine name.[9]\nGrowing up as a tomboy, his gender-atypical behavior during childhood was generally accepted at home, but as his secondary sex characteristics continued to develop around age 16, his home and school life became increasingly tense.[10] He was subjected to bullying in school, due to gender non-conforming behavior and clothing. Angel described the bullying as harming his communication skills as a result of psychological distress. To cope with his distress, he used alcohol and marijuana as a means of self-medication.[9][11]\nAfter a suicidal gesture in high school, his parents sent him to therapy. They thought that he needed help because he claimed to have reached a point of \"total disconnection\" from society.[9] This was not well received by his family, and according to Angel, \"They were going to put me in a mental institution.\" Unaware of the existence of treatments for gender dysphoria such as hormone replacement therapy, he lived for years  trying to conform to expectations of femininity, during which time he took drugs and drank alcohol. Though he was employed as a female professional model, he was generally dissatisfied with his identity and existence, and \"was not loving life\".[12] He turned to running as a means of isolation and source of validation.[9]\n\nGender transition[edit]\nAngel was unable to find appropriate help for completing his gender transition during his adolescent years.[9] He eventually met a therapist who affirmed his gender instead of viewing him as a \"gay woman\". Angel began researching various methods of medical transition, and began this process at the age of 28.[9][13] Angel and his therapist got in contact with an endocrinologist who worked primarily with transgender women as opposed to transgender men. This was because Angel was one of the earliest trans men to be allowed hormonal transition, due to which there was limited data on prior cases like his. Angel was, as his doctor stated, \"going to be my guinea pig\" (for human subject research), where experimentation was the main course of action in helping him. From then on, Angel's doctor began prescribing him test dosages of testosterone throughout a six-month period until a value solidified to fit his needs. Eventually, he was taking 1-cc doses of testosterone every 10 days.[9][11]\nAfterward, Angel began focusing on his physical appearance and searched for a surgeon that dealt with upper-body modifications to remove his breasts.  Bottom surgery was another aspect he was looking to change, because he wanted to have a penis to fit the male schema. However, he quickly realized that there was no sufficient technology at the time to create what he desired. He chose not to undergo genital surgery and currently considers his medical transition complete.[9][11]\n\nAdult film career[edit]\n Buck Angel\nAngel began to produce and star in his own line of adult films under the imprint Buck Angel Entertainment. By this time he identified and presented as male, and had not had genital surgery, so he promoted these works describing himself as \"The Man With a Pussy\". This has become his trademark.\nIn 2005, he appeared in the Titan Media release Cirque Noir, becoming the first trans man to be featured in an all-male film produced by a company specializing in gay male porn.[14][15] The same year he performed in Allanah Starr's Big Boob Adventures (directed by transgender woman Gia Darling), which featured the first filmed sex scene between a trans woman (Allanah Starr) and a trans man.[16] The performance was nominated for the AVN Awards' Most Outrageous Sex Scene. In 2007 Angel became the first and only trans man to win Transsexual Performer of the Year at the AVN Awards.[17] His 2008 performance in Buckback Mountain received nominations for \"Best Alternative Release\" and \"Best Specialty Release\" at the GayVN Awards. Angel also appears in Naked, a 2008 documentary book and film about the adult film industry, by director Ed Powers. In the film he appears in a sex scene with porn star Wolf Hudson, produced by mainstream photographer Justin Lubin.[18]\n\n Angel (center), with Michael Brandon and Scott Spears\nEducational work[edit]\nAngel's pornographic content was one of the building blocks that set the foundation for his future educational demonstrations. He broadened the industry's, along with its viewers', perception of sexuality and gender by popularizing trans male porn. He was unaware of the positive effects that he had on the community until after a few years into his work. With passing time, his work in porn evolved into advocacy.[11]\nNevertheless, the conversion of porn into an educational role was a tough task because of the stigma behind his work with sexual content. Angel's porn star identity made it difficult for him to express his ideas, as he felt he couldn't speak on behalf of himself. Moreover the porn  industry did not know what to make of his shift to sex education. Additionally, the hostility from the trans community did not contribute positively to his image, as they believed he was fetishizing the trans community.[13]\nIn time, Angel had the opportunity to be a guest speaker for Ideacity in 2010\u2014Canada's \u201cpremier meeting of the minds\u201d[19]\u2014where he talked about his physical changes and emotional adaptation from his transition.[20] During this presentation, he challenged the ideas of what makes a man through his own narrative and struggles. In short, he illustrates how the societal construct of masculinity is strict and unwavering; because of this, he is not considered to be under this category simply because he has a vagina.[20]\nIn 2012, Angel began to transition from the porn industry to sex education[21] and began touring the world speaking about human sexuality. He coined the catchphrase \"it's not what's between your legs that defines you\"[22] and his presentation \"Bucking the System\"[23] re-defines traditional notions of gender by educating his audience about gender fluidity and identity politics. Angel also tours to do Q & A sessions about his documentary, Sexing the Transman[24] and the autobiographical film \"Mr. Angel\".[25] He has made appearances at many universities around the world, as well as Pride events[26] and film festivals.[27] He has spoken at Sex Week at Yale University[28] and at IdeaCity10 in Toronto.[29]\nIn October 2010, Angel contributed to sex educator and columnist  Dan Savage's \"It Gets Better\" project by uploading Angel's own personal coming out story to YouTube.[30] He has also produced multiple public service announcements on the topics of positive body image, LGBTQ family acceptance, queer people of colour and transgender health and well-being.[31] Angel also engages in education about safe sex for trans men.\nIn 2012, Angel became a contributor to The Feminist Porn Book,[32] an anthology by feminist scholars and sex workers about understanding pornography and how feminists direct, act in, produce and consume porn.\nBetween 2010 and 2015, he created an award-winning series about trans male sexuality called \"Sexing The Transman XXX\", which is now in its fourth installment.[33] This film won \"Most Tantalizing Trans Film\" at the \"Feminist Porn Awards\" in 2012.[34]\nAngel wanted individuals to:\n\n\"Comprehend the fact that one\u2019s genitals do not define your gender, nor who you are as a person.\u201d[35]\n\u201cLearn how to acknowledge, affirm, and deal with your own individual gender and sexuality, regardless of identity.\u201d[35]\n\u201cHave the ability to let go of social constructs in order to become more comfortable and self-accepting.\u201d[35]\nOther activities[edit]\nAngel has appeared on various talk shows including those of Howard Stern, Tyra Banks, and Maury Povich; as well as Secret Lives of Women in the US, the Morning Show in the UK, and the Jensen Show in the Netherlands.\nBritish artist Marc Quinn included a life-size sculpture of Angel in his global tour.[36][37] Angel posed for Quinn's sculpture series on human transformations in 2010; the series was revealed at London's White Cube gallery. He was featured in four different bronze sculptures including two solo pieces, and two with Allanah Starr.[38] The life-sized sculpture of Angel is now a permanent fixture at the Art Gallery of South Australia.[39]\nIn 2012 he created a dating website for trans men called BuckAngelDating.com,[40] because \"there was still no special dating site catering to the unique needs of trans men.\"[41]\nAngel created \"Trantastic Storytelling\" in 2015, a service which offers opportunities for trans people to share their life experiences for educational purposes.[42]\nIn 2016, Angel partnered with Perfect Fit Brand to create a sex toy specifically for the FTM trans people. The product is meant to reduce gender dysphoria and help trans men connect with their bodies and their sexuality.[43]\nIn 2020, Angel launched a cannabis delivery service, Wings Of Wellness, aimed at LGBTQ customers. [44]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAngel was married to San Francisco-based dominatrix Karin Winslow (known professionally as Ilsa Strix). He filed for divorce when Winslow left him for a client, film director Lana Wachowski.[45][46][47]\nHe met his second wife, body piercer Elayne Angel, via a dating website[48] and the two married in New Orleans on November 17, 2003.[49][50] Elayne filed for divorce in May 2014.[51] Angel claimed that Elayne had moved $500,000 out of their joint bank account and requested $2,000 in monthly spousal support.[51]\nIn an effort to avoid alimony payments, Elayne claimed that their marriage should not have been legally recognized as Louisiana did not recognize same-sex marriage in 2003; Buck has never had his genitals surgically altered and his birth certificate was not updated to male until after their marriage.[50][51][52] In August 2014, the California Superior Court ruled that their marriage was valid due to the ambiguity in Louisiana's statute regarding sex reassignment surgery, which might include the \"top surgery\" that Angel had already received.[50][51][52]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\nIn January 2007, Buck Angel won Transsexual Performer of the Year at the AVN Awards.[53]\nIn 2008, 2009, and 2010, he was nominated for Transsexual Performer of the Year. He remains the only FTM transsexual ever to have been nominated for or to win this award.\nIn April 2008, he was presented with a \"Feminist Porn Award\" for \"Boundary Breaker of the Year.\"[54]\nIn 2012, he won the Feminist Porn Award for his groundbreaking film Sexing The Transman XXX.\nIn 2012, he won Best FTM Performer of the Year at the Transgender Erotica Awards. This is the first year this award was given.\nIn 2015, he won the PORyes Award (Feminist Pornfilmpreis Europe) in Berlin [55]\nIn 2015, he won the Ida Feldman award at the 23rd Brazil Mix Festival[56]\nIn 2016, he was given an Honorary Award at the Tel Aviv Film Festival [57]\nIn 2017, he received the XBIZ award for \"Specialty Product/Line of the Year Award\" [58]\nIn 2017, he was given the \"Outstanding Innovation Award\" at the AVN \"O\" Awards[58]\nIn 2017, Angel and Valentina Nappi won the AVN Award for \"Best Transsexual Scene\" for the film Girl/Boy 2[59]\nPartial filmography[edit]\nAdult films[edit]\n2004: \"Buck's Beaver\"\n2005: \"The Adventures of Buck Naked\"\n2005: \"Cirque Noir\"\n2005: \"Allanah Starr's Big Boob Adventures\"\n2006: \"Buck Off\"\n2006: \"V for Vagina\"\n2006: \"The Buck Stops Here\"\n2007: \"Even More Bang for Your Buck Vol.1\"\n2008: \"Even More Bang for your Buck Vol.2\"\n2008: \"Buckback Mountain\"\n2009: \"Ultimate Fucking Club Vol. 1\"\n2009: \"Ultimate Fucking Club Vol.2\"\n2010\u201312: \"Sexing The Transman XXX Series\"\n2016: \"Girl/Boy\" (Evil Angel)\nDocumentaries[edit]\n2008: \"NAKED\"\n2012: \"Sexing the Transman\"\n2013: \"Mr. Angel\"\n2016: \"The Trans List\" (HBO)\n2016: \"Finding Kim\"\n2016: \"BLOWN\"\nMainstream media[edit]\n1993: Porno for Pyros - \"Cursed Female\"\n2015: \"Technical Difficulties of Intimacy\"\n2016: Appeared in the video for \"Bi\", a song by Alicia Champion.[60]\n2016: Loki Starfish - \"Shivers are Proof\" (Paris)[61]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Angel, Buck (April 3, 2019). \"Our Story\". www.facebook.com.

British experimental musician David Tibet of Current 93 heard the recording and offered to release it through his Durtro record label; the debut album, Antony and the Johnsons, was released in 2000. In 2001, Anohni released a follow-up EP through Durtro, I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy, which, in addition to the title track, included a cover of a David Lynch/Angelo Badalamenti song \"Mysteries of Love\", and a Current 93 song, \"Soft Black Stars\".[11]\nAntony and the Johnsons' 2005 album I Am a Bird Now featured guest performances by Lou Reed, Boy George, Rufus Wainwright and Devendra Banhart. The album was released in North America by Secretly Canadian Records and in Europe by Rough Trade. It won the UK's Mercury Prize[12] and was named Album of the Year by Mojo magazine. The band toured North America, Europe, Australia and parts of South America for a year and a half in support of I am a Bird Now. The song \"Bird Gerhl\" was featured in the soundtrack for the movie V for Vendetta.\n\n Anohni in 2008.\nAntony and the Johnsons collaborated with experimental film maker Charles Atlas and presented TURNING in Nov 2006 in Rome, London, Paris, Madrid, and Braga, Portugal. The concert featured live video portraits of transgender women from New York City. The Guardian called the piece \"fragile, life affirming, and truly wonderful (five stars)\"[13] Le Monde in Paris hailed TURNING as \"Concert-manifeste transsexuel.\"[14]\nIn 2007, Anohni created an original soundtrack for a video by Nick Knight featuring the designs of Hussein Chalayan. She collaborated in 2008 with Prada to create a song called \"The Great White Ocean\" for their promotional campaign.\nAntony and the Johnsons' 5-song Another World EP was released on 7 October 2008. Antony and the Johnsons' third album, The Crying Light, was released on 19 January 2009. The album peaked at number 1 on the European Billboard charts.[15] Anohni has described the theme of the album as being \"about landscape and the future.\"[16] The album was mixed by Bryce Goggin and includes arrangements by Nico Muhly. Ann Powers wrote of The Crying Light for the LA Times online, \"it's the most personal environmentalist statement possible, making an unforeseen connection between queer culture's identity politics and the green movement. As music, it's simply exquisite \u2013 more controlled and considered than anything Antony and the Johnsons have done and sure to linger in the minds of listeners.\"[17]\nAfter touring throughout North America and Europe in support of their new album, Antony and the Johnsons presented a unique staging of \"The Crying Light\" with the Manchester Camerata at the Manchester Opera House for the 2009 Manchester International Festival.[18] The concert hall was transformed with laser effects created by installation artist Chris Levine. Antony and the Johnsons have gone on to present concerts with symphonies across Europe in Summer 2009, including the Opera Orchestra of Lyon, the Metropole Orchestra, Roma Sinfonietta and the Montreux Jazz Festival Orchestra. At Salle Pleyel in Paris, Anohni appeared in a costume designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy.[19]\nFall 2010 saw the release of Thank You For Your Love EP and in October the full-length album Swanlights on Secretly Canadian and Rough Trade. Abrams Books also published a book edition of Swanlights featuring Anohni's drawings and collages with photography by Don Felix Cervantes. At the end of October Anohni performed a special concert in New York City at Lincoln Center to commemorate the life of Kazuo Ohno who had died in June 2010.[20]\nIn January 2011, Anohni was a guest on \"Wintergasten\", a program on Dutch Television's VPRO channel and was interviewed by Leon Verdonschot discussing her political and ecological viewpoints in reference to different film clips.[21]\nAnohni performed at the TED conference in Long Beach in 2011 in a session on \"Radical Collaboration\".[22]\n\n Antony and the Johnsons perform with the Heritage Orchestra in 2012.\nDuring the 2011 Manchester International Festival Anohni was Musical Director for The Life and Death of Marina Abramovi\u0107, a biography of the 'Godmother' of performance art, re-imagined by director Robert Wilson and co-starring Willem DaFoe, Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Anohni. The piece has subsequently been staged in Madrid, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Basel, Toronto (as part of the Luminato Festival) and NYC.[23]\nIn January 2012, Antony and the Johnsons were presented by the Museum of Modern Art at Radio City Music Hall in \"Swanlights\", a collaboration with laser artist Chris Levine and set designer Carl Robertshaw. The performance was described by The New York Times in a review by Jon Parales entitled \"Cries From the heart, Crashing Like Waves.\"[24] This collaboration was also staged at the Royal Opera House in London in 2013 and at Teatro Real in Madrid in 2014.[25][26]\nAntony and the Johnsons released a live symphonic album in August 2012 entitled Cut The World featuring the Danish Radio Orchestra.[27] The album features a spoken track called \"Future Feminism\" in which Anohni elaborates on her view of the connection between feminism and ecology. A video for the song \"Cut the World\" directed by Nabil features Willem Dafoe, Carice van Houten and Marina Abramovi\u0107.[28]\nAnohni was the curator of Meltdown 2012 at the Southbank Centre in London.[29]\nAnohni was \"guest of honor\" at the Melbourne Festival in October 2012, presenting a restaging of \"Swanlights\", as well as screening Charles Atlas' Turning, Lynette Wallworth's Coral: Rekindling Venus, and presenting Paradise, an exhibition of Antony's drawings and collages.[30][31]\nAnohni performed with orchestra for the 2013 Spring Givenchy collection in Paris, singing You Are My Sister and expanding on the theme of Future Feminism in literature distributed at the event.[32]\nIn June 2015, Antony and the Johnsons performed at Dark Mofo in Tasmania, Australia, as a benefit in support of the Martu people of Parnngurr in WA in their fight to prevent a uranium mine from being developed near their community by Canadian multinational Cameco and Mitsubishi. Anohni appeared with Martu representatives at a press conference at the MCA in Sydney and on ABC's \"Q and A\" in further service of this cause.[33]\nAnohni collaborated with composer J. Ralph on the song \"Manta Ray\" from the environmental documentary Racing Extinction, which explored various aspects of the Holocene extinction. This would be the last song released where she was credited as Antony. A music video was released, featuring various microscopic marine organisms. Despite receiving a nomination for Best Original Song at the 88th Academy Awards, Anohni decided to boycott the ceremony. She expressed discomfort over the Academy's decision to characterize her in the days leading up to the ceremony as having been \"cut\" from the line-up[34] due to \"time constraints\", despite never actually having been asked to perform in the first place. She went on: \"singing about eco-cide... might not sell advertising space\" and that the system is one \"of social oppression and diminished opportunities for transpeople that has been employed by capitalism in the U.S. to crush our dreams and our collective spirit\".[35]\n\nAnohni[edit]\nMain article: Hopelessness (album)\nOn 23 February 2015, Anohni announced her fifth album Hopelessness via the Antony and the Johnsons' website and Facebook account. Co-produced by Anohni, Oneohtrix Point Never and Hudson Mohawke, it is her first album to be released under her new name, a name she had been using in her personal life \"for years\".[36] In the announcement, Anohni described the album as \"an electronic record with some sharp teeth\" and the UK's Independent described it as a \"bitterly beautiful record\".[37] On 30 November 2015, Anohni released \"4 Degrees\", the first song from Hopelessness.[38] Commenting on the album's lead single in a fan interview earlier in the year, Anohni had stated that she had \"grown tired of grieving for humanity\", adding that she felt she \"was not being entirely honest by pretending that I am not a part of the problem. '4 Degrees' is kind of a brutal attempt to hold myself accountable, not just valorize my intentions but also reflect on the true impact of my behaviors.\"[39]\nOn 9 March 2016, Anohni premiered the album's second single \"Drone Bomb Me\" on Annie Mac's show on BBC Radio 1 later that day, accompanied by a music video directed by Nabil Elderkin and starring English supermodel Naomi Campbell.[40] The video Hopelessness was released on 6 May 2016 and was nominated for the 2016 Mercury Prize and a Brit.[41] Anohni toured throughout Europe, the US and Australia in 2016, performing with her face obscured under a veil throughout the concert, in front of stark projections of a series of lip-synching women. The confrontational performance was described by New York Times as a combination of \"hard-core punk\" and \"radical empathy that's hard to find anywhere in pop.\"[42] In early 2017 she went onto release a further EP entitled PARADISE, working with the same producers. The final track was awarded only to those who wrote to ANOHNI's email with \"...a sentence or two what you care most about, or your hopes for the future. Send this to me instead of the dollar you used to send me in the olden days.\"\nIn 2018, for the occasion of her exhibition at Nikolaj Kunsthal in Copenhagen, Anohni released the track \"Miracle Now\" on YouTube, which features a video of 1990s NYC transgender performance artist Page Reynolds, featured in The Johnsons' play MIRACLE NOW of 1996 as \"The Last Dolphin.\"[43]\nIn 2020 Anohni released a single \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" by Bob Dylan and \"Be My Husband\", originally by Nina Simone.\nIn the days after the Republican National Convention she released a protest single via YouTube called \"R.N.C. 2020\" with an accompanying essay published in The Guardian [44]\n\nMusical collaborations[edit]\nIn addition to Antony and the Johnsons, Anohni occasionally collaborates with other musicians. In 2003, she began working with Lou Reed as a supporting vocalist on the Animal Serenade tour and performed on a number of tracks on Reed's album The Raven. She sang back up (with Sharon Jones and a children's choir) in Lou Reed's first full performance of his album Berlin at St Ann's Warehouse in NYC in December 2006 and at The State Theatre in Sydney, Australia in January 2007. Anohni sang \"If It Be Your Will\" as a part of Hal Willner's Came So Far For Beauty concerts at the Sydney Opera House in 2005; this performance was later featured in the film Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man, a tribute to Leonard Cohen.\nIn 2006, she collaborated with Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk in recording sessions in Jamaica and Iceland. The songs, \"The Dull Flame of Desire\" and \"My Juvenile\" were featured on her 2007 album Volta. The two also sang the songs in duet at several of Bj\u00f6rk's concerts, including London, Reykjav\u00edk and New York.[45][46] In 2015 Anohni sang for Bj\u00f6rk again on Vulnicura's \"Atom Dance\".\nAlso in 2006 she co-produced Songs from the Coalmine Canary by Little Annie, also playing piano, singing backup vocals, and co-writing several songs on the album. The song \"Strangelove\", co-written by Anohni and Little Annie, was used as the soundtrack for Levi's \"Dangerous Liaisons\" advertising campaign in 2007, garnering several awards, including the Cannes Lions \u2013 International Advertising Festival, 2007 (Bronze Lion) for \"Best Use of Music\".[47]\nIn 2008, Anohni was featured on five tracks from the self-titled disco album Hercules and Love Affair, most notably on \"Blind\",[48] which was voted best track of 2008 by Pitchfork Media[49] and ranked at number 2 on the \"10 Best Singles of 2008\" list by American magazine Entertainment Weekly.[50]\nAnohni worked with Bernard Butler on some acoustic sessions for the radio station XFM.[51] In June 2009, she appeared live with Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band at Ornette Coleman's Meltdown at the Royal Festival Hall, singing Ono's \"Toyboat\".[52] In the same year, she collaborated with Bryce Dessner on the Bob Dylan song \"I Was Young When I Left Home\" for the AIDS benefit album Dark Was the Night, produced by the Red Hot Organization.\nIn October 2020, Anohni appeared on Cocorosie's politically charged single Smoke 'em Out\" with Big Freedia, Cakes da Killa and others.[53]\n\nFilm and television[edit]\nAppears in Steve Buscemi's Animal Factory (2000) singing \"Rapture\"\n\"I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy\" is featured in Thom Fitzgerald's The Event (2003)\nPerforms \"I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy\" in the French film Wild Side (2004)[54]\nFeatured singing \"If It Be Your Will\" in the documentary Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man (2005).\n\"Hope There's Someone\" in the movie The Secret Life of Words (2005).\nThe song \"Bird Gerhl\" plays on the jukebox while Evey and V dance in V for Vendetta (2006).\n\"Hope There's Someone\" in the Torchwood episode \"Random Shoes\" (2006).\n\"River of Sorrow\" in the \"Bones\" episode \"The He in the She\" (2008).\nFeatured on the soundtrack of the Bob Dylan biographical film biopic I'm Not There singing \"Knocking on Heaven's Door\".[55]\n\"Hope There's Someone\" plays during the end sequence of episode 8 of the first season of the crime drama series Saving Grace.\n\"Fistful of Love\" plays during a scene of a French movie Les Petits Mouchoirs from Guillaume Canet in 2011.\n\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\" is used in the trailer for the series finale of Sons of Anarchy[56]\n\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\" appears at the end of 9th episode of the Netflix series Sense8.\n\"Bird Gerhl\" was covered by Birdy for the expressive dance and flight scenes across the stadium featuring Miranda and David Toole during the opening ceremony for the Summer Paralympic Games of London 2012.\n\"Angel on Fire\" appears on the Deluxe Edition of the soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.\n\"In My Dream\" plays during the fourth episode of HBO series Euphoria when Nate reveals himself to Jules as 'Tyler', the person she has been exchanging texts with.\nVisual art and performance[edit]\nIn July 2008, Anohni debuted a number of self-produced visual artworks in a Brussels exhibition curated by Jerome Sans. Working with longtime collaborator/photographer Don Felix Cervantes and adviser Joie Iacono, she went on to have solo exhibitions at Isis Gallery in London and Accademia Albertina in Turin, Italy.\nIn April 2009, she curated an exhibition entitled \"6 Eyes\" at the Agnes B. Galerie Du Jour in Paris. In this exhibition she drew connections between her own work and the work of artists Peter Hujar, Kiki Smith, Barbara Cummard, Alice O'Malley, James Elaine and William Basinski and was the first time the work of Peter Hujar had ever been exhibited in France.\nA solo exhibition of Anohni's drawings and sculptures opened at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles in January 2012.[57]\nA solo exhibition of Anohni's drawings and sculptures opened at Sikkema Jenkins Gallery in NYC in June 2013. Roberta Smith of The New York Times said of the show \"Sometimes talent is concentrated, sometimes it spans multiple mediums. That of Anohni, singer-songwriter and leading light of the musical group Antony and the Johnsons, is the spanning kind. She is also a serious visual artist. Her first solo show in New York follows exhibitions in Los Angeles and London, and introduces a sensibility that is consistent with her heart-rending songs and warbling delivery: fragile, falling apart but surviving, even defiant.\"[58]\nA further exhibition that included Anohni's drawings opened in September 2014 at Sikkemma Jenkins gallery in NYC.[59]\nCollaborating with Johanna Constantine, Kembra Pfahler, and Bianca and Sierra Casady, Anohni co-presented the exhibition and performance series \"FUTURE FEMINISM\" at The Hole in NYC in September 2014. Thirteen rose quartz sculptures were displayed during the 2-week event series, and artists including Lorraine O'Grady, Lydia Lunch, Kiki Smith, Marina Abramovic, Terence Koh and Narcissister made presentations.[60][61]\nIn Autumn 2016, Anohni presented \"My Truth\", the largest exhibition of her work to date, across seven rooms at the Kunsthalle Bielefeld in Germany. On the first and second floors of the museum, Anohni also curated work by Peter Hujar, Kazuo Ohno and James Elaine.[62]\nAnohni was artist-in-residence at European Capital of Culture, Aarhus 2017.[63] In August she co-presented FUTURE FEMINISM at 'O' Space in Aarhus with Kembra Pfahler and Johanna Constantine.[64] The program featured 25 lectures, performances and workshops, including a presentations by FEMEN and Victoria Kawesa from the Feminist Party of Sweden, Kembra Pfahler's \"Performance Art 101\" and a course in self-defense.[65]\nAnohni presented a multimedia exhibition at Nikolaj Kunsthal in Copenhagen opening in May 2018. The installation includes a collection of framed newspaper articles on the traumatic passing of Marsha P. Johnson, global warming and the melting polar icecap, the beginnings of the AIDS crisis, and cold war nuclear waste disposal. A series of nine archival video loops revisit Anohni's 1996 production \"Miracle Now\" with her NYC performance group The Johnsons, featuring performers and collaborators including Dr. Julia Yasuda, Johanna Constantine, Page, Lavinia Co-op, and Amanda Lepore. Another gallery contains archives and visual materials from her work as a playwright and director in the NYC experimental theater and nightclub scene during the 1990s. Three further galleries contain assemblies of Anohni's paintings, sculptures, and videos.[66]\nIn April 2019, Anohni mounted an exhibition entitled \"LOVE\" at The Kitchen in New York City. She wrote of the exhibition in the program, \"We face grave uncertainty about the existence of a future. Can we reorganize our compulsion to cut the throat of nature? I keep asking myself, 'What Is Really Happening?\u2019 The same illness infecting the biosphere has grown around the systems that support my own contemporary life, and a bloom of hopelessness opened up in me. I think about holding space for vanishing, of people, of communities, of biodiversity, in a way that opens into spectral time, leaking all points at once\". In part a memorial for her longtime collaborator Julia Yasuda, Anohni published a book of photos by Julia's wife, Erika Yasuda, to coincide with the event. Anohni also staged a play entitled \"She Who Saw Beautiful Things\" which included performances by Charles Atlas, Lorraine O'Grady, Connie Flemming, Laurie Anderson, and others.[67][68]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAnohni is transgender and uses the pronouns she/her. In an interview with Flavorwire in November 2014 she stated, \"My closest friends and family use feminine pronouns for me. I have not mandated the press do one thing or another... In my personal life I prefer 'she'. I think words are important. To call a person by their chosen gender is to honor their spirit, their life and contribution. 'He' is an invisible pronoun for me; it negates me.\"[69]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nWith Antony and the Johnsons\n\nAntony and the Johnsons (2000)\nI Am a Bird Now (2005)\nThe Crying Light (2009)\nSwanlights (2010)\nCut the World (live) (2012)\nTurning (live DVD and soundtrack) (2014)\nAs Anohni\n\nHopelessness (2016)\nParadise EP (2017)\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\nAwards\nWork\nCategory\nResult\n\n\n2005\n\nMercury Prize\n\nI Am a Bird Now\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\nWon\n\n\n2006\n\nBrit Awards\n\nHerself\n\nBritish Male Solo Artist\n\nNominated\n\n\n2008\n\nUK Music Video Awards\n\n\"Blind\" (with Hercules and Love Affair)\n\nBest Pop Video - UK\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Art Vinyl\n\nBest Vinyl Art[70]\n\nNominated\n\n\n2011\n\nNew York Music Awards\n\nHerself\n\nBest Alternative Male Vocalist\n\nWon\n\n\n2016\n\nAcademy Awards\n\n\"Manta Ray\"\n\nBest Original Song\n\nNominated\n\n\nMercury Prize\n\nHopelessness\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\nNominated\n\n\nRober Awards Music Poll\n\nHerself\n\nBest Female Artist\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Live Artist\n\nNominated\n\n\nBest Pop Artist\n\nWon\n\n\n\"4 Degrees\"\n\nSong of the Year\n\nNominated\n\n\nHopelessness\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\nNominated\n\n\n2017\n\nA2IM Libera Awards\n\nBest Dance/Electronica Album\n\nNominated\n\n\n\"Drone Bomb Me\"\n\nVideo of the Year\n\nNominated\n\n\nVideo of the Year (Fan Vote)\n\nNominated\n\n\nBrit Awards\n\nHerself\n\nBritish Female Solo Artist\n\nNominated\n\n\nRober Awards Music Poll\n\nParadise\n\nBest EP\n\nNominated\n\nOther recordings[edit]\n\n\nSong\n\nAlbum\n\nArtist\n\nYear\n\n\n\"Blood on the Door\"\nBreadcrumb Sins\nJamie Saft\n2002\n\n\n\"You Stand Above Me\" \u2013 Antony (1:36)\nLive at St. Olaves\nsplit EP with Current 93\n2003\n\n\n\"The Lake\" \u2013 Antony (4:48)\n\n\n\"Cripple and the Starfish\" \u2013 Antony (4:51)\n\n\n\"Perfect Day\"\nThe Raven\nLou Reed\n2003\n\n\n\"Candy Says\"\nAnimal Serenade\nLou Reed\n2004\n\n\n\"A Little Bit of Time\"\nRed Tape\nBrooks\n2004\n\n\n\"Old Whore's Diet\"\nWant Two\nRufus Wainwright\n2004\n\n\n\"Beautiful Boyz\"\nNoah's Ark\nCocoRosie\n2005\n\n\n\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" with Boy George\nHelp!: A Day in the Life\nWar Child album\n2005\n\n\n\"Idumea\" / \"The Beautiful Dancing Dust\"\nBlack Ships Ate the Sky\nCurrent 93\n2006\n\n\n(several)\nSongs from the Coalmine Canary[71]\nLittle Annie\n2006\n\n\n\"Semen Song for James Bidgood\"\nThe Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast\nMatmos\n2006\n\n\n\"I Defy\"\nReal Life\nJoan as Policewoman\n2006\n\n\n\"If It Be Your Will\"\nLeonard Cohen: I'm Your Man\nLeonard Cohen tribute\n2006\n\n\n\"One More Try\"\nDial 0\nMy Robot Friend\n2006\n\n\n\"Living the Blues\"\nTrouble: The Jamie Saft Trio Plays Bob Dylan\nJamie Saft Trio\n2006\n\n\n\"Lowlands Low\"\nRogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys\nBryan Ferry\n2006\n\n\n\"Leave Her Johnny\"\nRogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys\nLou Reed\n2006\n\n\n\"Keep in Touch\"\nSpeaks Volumes\nNico Muhly\n2006\n\n\n\"All There Is to Tell\"\nGolden Boy\nReuben Butchart\n2007\n\n\n\"The Dull Flame of Desire\" / \"My Juvenile\"\nVolta\nBj\u00f6rk\n2007\n\n\n\"The Ballad of the Sad Young Men\"\nStardom Road\nMarc Almond\n2007\n\n\n\"Beauty\"\nVersatile Heart\nLinda Thompson\n2007\n\n\n\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\"[55]\nI'm Not There\nsoundtrack\n2007\n\n\n(all)\nThe Snow Abides\nMichael Cashmore\n2007\n\n\n\"God with No Tear\"\nVisionaire\n53 Sound\n2007\n\n\n\"Del suo veloce volo\"\nFleurs 2\nFranco Battiato\n2008\n\n\n\"Ooh Baby Baby\"\nEasy Come, Easy Go\nMarianne Faithfull\n2008\n\n\n\"Will I Ever Learn\"\nWas muss muss\nHerbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer\n2008\n\n\n\"Be Good to Earth This Season\" with Kr\u00eda Brekkan\nsplit 7\" single\nReverend Green\n2008\n\n\n\"I Was Young When I Left Home\"\nDark Was The Night\ncharity album\n2009\n\n\n\"Forgiveness\"\nHeart\nElisa\n2009\n\n\n\"Nessun Dorma\"\nLavazza campaign\nwith The Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra\n2009\n\n\n\"Stranger Perfumes\" & \"Another Day in America\"\nHomeland\nLaurie Anderson\n2010\n\n\n\"Fletta\"\nSwanlights\nBj\u00f6rk\n2010\n\n\n\"Returnal\"\nReturnal\nOneohtrix Point Never\n2010\n\n\n\"Who am I to feel so free?\"\nTalk About Body\nMEN\n2011\n\n\n\"Prisoner of Love\"[72]\nSee the Light\nJessica 6\n2011\n\n\n\"Tearz for Animals\"\nWe Are on Fire \u2013 Single\nCocoRosie\n2012\n\n\n\"Particle of Light\"\nSee You on the Ice\nCarice van Houten\n2012\n\n\n\"Janitor of Lunacy\"\nDesertshore / The Final Report\nX-TG\n2012\n\n\n\"Poison\"\nTales of a GrassWidow\nCocoRosie\n2013\n\n\n\"Mourned Winter Then\"\nI Am the Last of All the Field That Fell: A Channel\nCurrent 93\n2014\n\n\n\"Atom Dance\"\nVulnicura\nBj\u00f6rk\n2015\n\n\n\"Indian Steps\"\nLantern\nHudson Mohawke\n2015\n\n\n\"Manta Ray\"\nRacing Extinction\nJ.

She is also a noted LGBT rights activist who maintains a large support website for transgender people,[2] and a politician serving in the Madrid Assembly, the first trans person to serve in a legislature in Spain.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Political activism\n3 Film and television work\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nAntonelli attended the Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Arts (Conservatorio de M\u00fasica y Arte Dram\u00e1tico) in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\nIn 1980 she recorded the first documentary on transsexuality for TVE2. It was not aired until September 1981, after the failed 23-F coup by Antonio Tejero.\nAntonelli is best known for her role as Gloria in the television series El s\u00edndrome de Ulises\u00a0[es].\n\nPolitical activism[edit]\nIn 1997 Antonelli joined in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), as Area Coordinator for the Federal Transsexual/GLBT Group.\nIn 2004 the PSOE won the elections and the Congress approved gay marriage, but trans rights were not granted at that time. In 2006, Antonelli threatened a hunger strike unless the PSOE majority adopted the Gender Identity Law (Ley de Identidad de G\u00e9nero). The law was adopted in 2007, and she was the first transsexual person in the Community of Madrid to obtain the amended sex designation on her legal documents.\nAntonelli has spoken out against attempts to prohibit sex work in Spain, noting that it would disproportionately affect trans women, who often have difficulty finding other work.\nShe has received several awards for her work. The Transsexual Collective of Madrid honored her in 2003 for her trailblazing efforts. She was honored by transgender groups in Catalonia and Andalusia in 2008 for her work on the Gender Identity Act. She won the 2008 Premios L\u00e1tigos y Plumas from the Federaci\u00f3n Estatal de Gays, Lesbianas y Transexuales de Espa\u00f1a and the 2009 Baeza Award (Premia Baeza) for visibility.\nOn May 22, 2011, Antonelli was elected on the list of the Spanish Socialist Party to the Assembly of the Community of Madrid, becoming the first trans person elected to a legislature in Spain and was re-elected in the 2015 and 2019 regional elections.[4]\n\nFilm and television work[edit]\nHijos de pap\u00e1 (dir.

While officials from ICE have refused to comment on Arellano's death,[1] advocates for immigrants, AIDS patients, and the LGBT community have decried the lack of provision of medical care as unjust and discriminatory.\nVictoria was born in Mexico and came to the United States as a child. She was a transgender woman who was categorized as male at birth.\nAfter contracting HIV, she was prescribed bactrim, later switching to dapasone. Both medications were daily antibiotics. Three years prior to being detained, doctors at a Los Angeles free clinic described her as \"asymptomatic\". Her condition began deteriorating in May 2007, when, after being detected entering the country illegally for the second time, she was detained at a facility in San Pedro, California, she was denied her medication and medical attention.\nArellano was cared for by inmates at the facility, who took turns taking her to the bathroom and brought her cool towels. She was transported to the infirmary on July 13, 2007 and prescribed amoxicillin. She was unable to keep the drugs down and began vomiting blood.\nEighty detainees protested the denial of her treatment, chanting \"Hospital\" and ignoring an order to get in line for the night's head count.

Again, she was debilitated by vomiting and diarrhea, and again transported to the hospital, this time to the intensive care unit of Little Company of Mary Hospital in San Pedro.

He was an officer of the National Fascisti, as well as a bankrupt and a convicted criminal.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Marriage\n3 Fascism\n4 Bankruptcy, prison and later life\n5 Death\n6 Legacy\n7 References\n8 Further reading\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBarker was born Lillias Irma Valerie Barker on 27 August 1895 in Saint Clement on the Channel Island of Jersey, the child of Thomas William Barker, farmer and architect, and his wife, Lillias Adelaide Hill. The family moved to Surrey in 1899. \nIn April 1918, Barker married an Australian, Lieutenant Harold Arkell Smith, in Milford, Surrey.[1] The marriage lasted only a short period and the husband returned to Australia early the following year. On 26 August 1918, Barker enrolled as a member of the Women's Royal Air Force.[2] After the war, Barker moved in with Ernest Pearce-Crouch, also of the Australian Imperial Force; the couple had a boy and a girl. After they had moved to a farm at Climping near Littlehampton, West Sussex, Barker started to dress in a more masculine way.\n\nMarriage[edit]\nBarker left Pearce-Crouch in 1923 and began a relationship with Elfrida Emma Haward. Although Barker was presenting as a woman when Haward first met him, Barker wrote that he told her that he was \"a man who had been injured in the war; that I was really a man acting as a woman for family reasons. I made some excuse about it being my mother's wish, and she believed it.\"[3] The couple began living at the Grand Hotel in Brighton.  By then, Barker had begun to use the name Sir Victor Barker. On 14 November 1923 at St Peter's Church, Brighton, Barker and Haward wed in what was later judged to be an illegal marriage.[2]\n\nFascism[edit]\nIn 1926 while living in London, Barker received a letter addressed to a different Colonel Barker, inviting him to join the National Fascisti. Barker replied to the misdirected letter with the missive \"why not\", reasoning that membership of what was a macho group would help him pose as a man.[2] He lived at the National Fascisti headquarters in  Earl's Court where he worked as secretary for the group's leader Henry Rippon Seymour, also involving himself in training young members in boxing and fencing.[2] Barker involved himself in the kind of rough-housing that became the hallmark of the group and later recalled that \"I used to go out with the boys to Hyde Park and we had many rows with the Reds.\"[2] That he was assigned female at birth was never picked up on by his fellow members.[2]\nIn 1927, he was brought before the Old Bailey on charges of possessing a forged firearm certificate after Rippon Seymour had pulled Barker's revolver on another member, Charles Eyres, in a dispute over party funds. \"Colonel Barker\" was found not guilty and left the group soon after the trial.[4]\n\nBankruptcy, prison and later life[edit]\nAs Leslie Ivor Victor Gauntlett Bligh Barker, restaurant proprietor, he was made bankrupt in 1928;[5] the London Gazette notice was amended some months later to \"Lillias Irma Valerie Arkell-Smith ... commonly known as Leslie Ivor Victor Gauntlett Bligh Barker\".[6]\nIn 1929, Barker was arrested at the Regent Palace Hotel, London, for contempt of court for failing to appear in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings. Barker was held in Brixton prison before transfer to a woman's prison, Holloway. \nHe was ultimately charged with, and convicted of, making a false statement on a marriage certificate. The judge, Sir Ernest Wild, the Recorder of London, sentenced him to nine months' imprisonment for perjury;  from the bench, Wild said that Barker had \"profaned the house of God\".[7] After being released from Holloway, Barker moved to Henfield, West Sussex, where he lived as John Hill. While there, in 1934, he was arrested for theft but acquitted. In 1937 when employed as a manservant in London, he pleaded guilty to theft and was fined.[8]\nLater, he wrote about his life several times in popular newspapers and magazines. As Colonel Barker, he appeared in a Blackpool sideshow called \"On a Strange Honeymoon\" in the 1930s.[9][10]\n\nDeath[edit]\nHe died in obscurity, under the name Geoffrey Norton, on 18 February 1960 and was buried in an unmarked grave in Kessingland churchyard, near Lowestoft, Suffolk.[11][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nD. H. Lawrence, in the essay \"A Propos of Lady Chatterley's Lover\" (1929), cited Colonel Barker, namely that \"his poor wife thought she was married normally and happily to a real husband\", as an example of ignorance about sex.\nThe story of the many lives of Barker is told in Colonel Barker's Monstrous Regiment by Rose Collis, Virago 2001.\nBrighton Museum and History Centre marked his life during February 2006, as part of England's LGBT month's celebrations.[12]\n\"The Perfect Gentleman\", one of the Queers: Eight Monologues (2017), curated by Mark Gatiss, was based on Barker.[13]\nIn Female Masculinity (1998), Jack Halberstam writes that Barker represented \"the beginning of the emergence of a transsexual identity.\"[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Marriage\".

Arquette was distantly related to American explorer Meriwether Lewis.[6][3] Actors Rosanna, Richmond, Patricia, and David Arquette are her siblings.\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 1982, at the age of 12, Arquette's first acting gig was as \"this little kid who's on a ride with all these women and whatnot\" in the music video \"She's a Beauty\" by The Tubes.[7] In 1986, Arquette debuted on the big screen in an uncredited role as Alexis, the androgynous friend and bandmate of sexually ambivalent teenager Max Whiteman (Evan Richards) in Down and Out in Beverly Hills.[8]\nArquette, in the earlier years of her career, primarily performed as a female impersonator, frequently under the name \"Eva Destruction\". Later in her career, Alexis made public that she had begun the process leading to sex reassignment surgery.[9] To this end, Arquette had publicly declared that she considered her gender to be female.\nAt 19, Arquette played trans sex worker Georgette in the screen adaptation of Last Exit to Brooklyn.[10] The majority of Arquette's film work was in low-budget or independent films. In total, Arquette starred in more than 40 movies, including I Think I Do, Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror, and Sometimes They Come Back... Again. Arquette also starred as a crack addict opposite Tim Roth in Jumpin' at the Boneyard, as a teenage boy seeking revenge for a horrible childhood in the New Zealand-shot horror fantasy Jack Be Nimble, and as a murderous drag queen in the low budget comedy Killer Drag Queens on Dope.[11][12]\nArquette also had supporting roles in Pulp Fiction, Threesome and Bride of Chucky,[13] and she played a Boy George fanatic, George Stitzer, in the Adam Sandler\u2013Drew Barrymore film The Wedding Singer, singing \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\" over and over. Her role as Georgina, a Boy George impersonator, in another Sandler\u2013Barrymore film, Blended, was a reference to that role. In 2001, Arquette returned to New Zealand to play Roman emperor Caligula in two episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess.[citation needed] That same year, Arquette guest starred in the Friends episode \"The One with Chandler's Dad\", in which she directly interacted with her sister-in-law, Courteney Cox. Also in the same year, she cameoed in Son of the Beach.[citation needed]\nIn September 2005, VH1 announced Arquette as one of the celebrity house-guests on the 6th season of The Surreal Life. On January 31, 2007, Arquette was a featured celebrity client and guest judge on the premi\u00e8re episode of Bravo's reality show Top Design.[14] Arquette also made a cameo appearance in the music video for Robbie Williams' song \"She's Madonna\".[15]\n\nPersonal life and death[edit]\nIn 2004, Arquette expressed an interest in undergoing gender-affirming medical treatment in the form of hormone therapy and, ultimately, sex confirmation surgery, which she realized in 2006, in her late 30s.[16] Those experiences were documented in the film Alexis Arquette: She's My Brother, which debuted at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.[17] Arquette was a vocal supporter of other transgender people, including Chaz Bono, who transitioned shortly after her.[16]\nArquette contracted HIV in 1987.[18] In her later life, she suffered from ill health as a result of her HIV-positive status.[18][19][20] Amid these increasing complications, Alexis began presenting herself again as a man in 2013.[19] Her brother David Arquette said that she told him she was \"gender suspicious\", and alternately felt like a man or a woman at different times.[21][22][23]\nArquette was placed in a medically induced coma and died on September 11, 2016, surrounded by close family, at the age of 47. Arquette was serenaded with David Bowie's \"Starman\".[24][25][26] The cause of death was cardiac arrest caused by myocarditis stemming from HIV.[18][27]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1989\n\nLast Exit to Brooklyn\n\nGeorgette\n\n\n\n\n1990\n\nHigh Score\n\nYago / Freddie\n\n\n\n\n1990\n\nTerminal Bliss\n\nCraig Murphy\n\n\n\n\n1990\n\nGavre Princip \u2013 Himmel unter Steinen\n\nMilan\n\n\n\n\n1992\n\nJumpin' at the Boneyard\n\nDan\n\n\n\n\n1992\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nVampire DJ\n\n\n\n\n1992\n\nOf Mice and Men\n\nWhitt\n\n\n\n\n1992\n\nMiracle Beach\n\nLars\n\n\n\n\n1993\n\nGhost Brigade\n\nCpl.

She has two master's degrees.[1] At one point prior to her transition, Arsenault was an instructor at York University,[2] where she taught acting.[3]\nShe has said she realized that she was a trans woman in August 1996[4] and her transition was in full force around 1998.[5] By 2007 she had undergone over $150,000 in surgery during her transition,[6] financed through work in the sex trade[3] as a web cam girl, a stripper and a hooker (oral sex only).[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nArsenault wrote a regular column on transgender issues for 36 issues of fab, a biweekly Toronto-based LGBT magazine. Her last column was in early 2007.\nShe has appeared on the television series Train 48 and KinK, as well as the Showtime movie Soldier's Girl.\nShe had a well-publicized encounter with Tommy Lee where he flirted with Arsenault for some time before discovering that Arsenault was transgender, and subsequently left in a hurry.[8]\nArsenault appeared in a one-act play written especially for her by Sky Gilbert in November 2007 entitled Ladylike.[9] She also wrote her own one woman show called The Silicone Diaries,[3] directed by Buddies in Bad Times Artistic Director Brendan Healy, which toured across Canada to sold-out houses and critical praise.\nShe appeared also in The Jon Dore Television Show, appearing the episode \"Manly Man\". She stated the reason why she does not want to remove her current genitals:\n\nI work as a dancer in a club that caters to men who like \"transsexuals.\" They want us to have beautiful breasts, you know, to be sexy like females but they want that one thing to be different.[10]\nIn 2010, she performed an autobiographical play entitled i was Barbie.[11]\nIn 2012, she performed for 40 Days and 40 Nights as part of the inaugural SummerWorks Live Art series in Toronto.  For this performance, she spent 40 days undergoing a spiritual experience and opened the last 11 days to the public.  As part of this performance, she spent two hours a night whipping herself while riding an exercise bike.[12]  She has also performed For Every Time You Shattered Me I Made Myself Again, a six-hour performance in The Henry Moore Sculpture Room at The Art Gallery of Ontario where she appeared in a myriad of different personas live and onscreen, dressing, undressing and washing herself with a number of unspecified fluids in front of the audience.\nIn 2013, at London's performance space she lived inside an art gallery for six days for a work called Lillex.  Here, with UK artist Poppy Jackson, Arsenault performed rituals which explored feminine mythology as well as virtuality, including a trance-like dance which would often continue for six hours at a time.  During these dances she was repeatedly burned with cigarettes on her chest, neck, breasts and occasionally above the genitals, and appeared unaffected by pain.\nHer photographic and video collaborations with artists like Bruce LaBruce, John Greyson, Jordan Tannahill, and Istvan Kantor have been shown across Canada and around the world via film and video festivals, academic and art journals and galleries including the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, Pleasuredome, FADO and New York University.\nArsenault has been a frequent guest speaker at universities in Canada and The United States as well as intellectual conferences like Moses Znaimer's Ideacity.  She has also worked as a social activist promoting the rights and dignity of trans people with The Toronto Police Service, Mount Sinai Hospital, Women's College Hospital, The Sherbourne Health Centre, Supporting Our Youth, and The 519 Church Street Community Centre.\nIn 2013, Arsenault joined MAU, a New Zealand company of contemporary performance led by Lemi Ponifasio.  Her first work with MAU is called The Crimson House and is scheduled for a world tour in 2014 and beyond. In the same year, she had a supporting role in Greyson's web series Murder in Passing.[13]\nArsenault's life and work are the subject of the book Trans(per)forming Nina Arsenault - An Unreasonable Body of Work, edited by Judith Rudakoff, published in April 2012.[14]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nArsenault dated Canadian killer and alleged cannibal Luka Magnotta around 2002 before his notoriety for violent crimes. She says that Magnotta was obsessed with wanting to be famous, and that he made disturbing comments about injuring kittens when they dated. She has said that she believes that the murders he is alleged to have committed were done as a result of, and under the influence of, drugs.[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Nina Arsenault. \"Tranny porn saved my life\".

Her marriage was annulled in a notable court case known as Corbett v Corbett.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 1950s to 1970s\n\n2.1 Gender transition\n2.2 Modelling career, public outing\n\n\n3 Later life\n4 Biographies\n5 Awards and honours\n6 Notes\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBorn in Smithdown Hospital in Liverpool, Ashley was one of six surviving children of a Roman Catholic father Frederick Jamieson and Protestant mother Ada Brown,[2] who had married two years before.[3]  During her childhood in Liverpool, Ashley suffered from both calcium deficiency, requiring weekly calcium injections at the Alder Hey Children's Hospital, and bed-wetting, resulting in her being given her own box room aged two when the family moved house.[4]\n\n1950s to 1970s[edit]\nShe joined the Merchant Navy in 1951 at the age of 16.[5] Following a suicide attempt, she was given dishonourable discharge[4] and a second attempt resulted in Ashley being sent to the mental institution in Ormskirk at age 17.[5]\nIn her book The First Lady, Ashley tells the story of the rape she endured while still living as a man. A roommate raped her, and she was severely injured.[6]\n\nGender transition[edit]\nAfter leaving hospital Ashley moved to London, at one point claiming to have shared a boarding house with then ship's steward John Prescott, later deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom. Having started cross-dressing, she moved to Paris in the late 1950s, began using the name Toni April, and joined the entertainer Coccinelle in the cast of the drag cabaret at the Caroussel Theatre.[5][7]\nAt the age of 25, having saved \u00a33,000, Ashley had a seven-hour-long sex reassignment surgery on 12 May 1960, performed in Casablanca, Morocco, by Georges Burou. All her hair fell out, and she endured significant pain, but the operation was successful.[5][7]\n\nModelling career, public outing[edit]\nAfter returning to Britain, Ashley began using the name April Ashley and became a successful fashion model, appearing in Vogue (photographed by David Bailey[8]) and winning a small role in the film The Road to Hong Kong, which starred Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.[7][9][10]\nA friend sold her story to the media in 1961, and the Sunday People outed Ashley as a trans woman. She became a centre of attention and some scandal, and her film credit was dropped.[1][10]\nIn November 1960, Ashley met Hon. Arthur Corbett (later 3rd Baron Rowallan), the Eton-educated son and heir of Lord Rowallan. They wed in 1963, but the marriage quickly ended. Ashley's lawyers wrote to Corbett in 1966 demanding maintenance payments, and in 1967, Corbett responded by filing suit to have the marriage annulled. The annulment was granted in 1970 on the grounds that the court considered Ashley to be male, but Corbett knew about her history when they married.[5][7][8] This is the case known as Corbett v Corbett.\n\nLater life[edit]\nAfter a heart attack in London, Ashley retired for some years to the Welsh border town of Hay-on-Wye. In her book April Ashley's Odyssey, she stated that Amanda Lear was male at birth and that they had worked together at Le Carousel where Lear had used the name Peki d'Oslo.[4] Ashley was once great friends with Lear,[11] but according to Ashley's book The First Lady, they had a major falling out and haven't spoken in years.\nIn the 1980s, Ashley married Jeffrey West on the cruise ship RMS Queen Mary in Long Beach, California.[12] In 2005, after the passage of the Gender Recognition Act 2004, Ashley was legally recognised as female and issued with a new birth certificate. The then Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom John Prescott, who knew Ashley from the 1950s, helped her with the procedure.[citation needed]\nAshley talked about her life at St George's Hall, Liverpool as part of the city's Homotopia festival on 15 November 2008,[13] and on 18 February 2009 at the South Bank Centre.[14]\nShe lives in Fulham, South West London.[10]\n\nBiographies[edit]\nApril Ashley's Odyssey, a biography by Duncan Fallowell, was published in 1982.[4] In 2006, Ashley released her autobiography The First Lady[6] and made TV appearances on Channel Five News, This Morning and BBC News. In one interview, she said \"This is the real story and contains a lot of things I just couldn't say in 1982\", including alleged affairs with Michael Hutchence, Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Turner Prize sculptor Grayson Perry and \u00cd\u00f1igo de Arteaga y Mart\u00edn, the future 19th duke of Infantado, and others. However, the book was pulped[clarification needed] after it was discovered that it heavily plagiarized the 1982 book written about Ashley.[15]\nIn 2012, Pacific Films and Limey Yank Productions announced a project to create a film about Ashley's life.[16]\n\nAwards and honours[edit]\nAshley was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to transgender equality.[17][18]\nThe exhibition \"April Ashley: portrait of a lady\" was held at the Museum of Liverpool from 27 September 2013 to 1 March 2015.[19]\nAshley was awarded a Lifetime Achievement honour at the European Diversity Awards 2014.[20]\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"'Her' secret is out\" (jpg).

Always athletic and competitive, he practiced individual and team sports and by age 9 was already into boxing, baseball and particularly basketball his preferred sport. He continued playing sports into high school including competitively sometimes in the boys' team. He was named top athlete both boys and girls by the school's athletic director.[3]\nAshley was raised in a church-oriented family, his father being Roman Catholic and his mother Pentecostal Christian which influenced some of the attitudes held by family during his coming out. First, Ashley came out as homosexual when he was 17 years old,[4] although he never called himself a \"lesbian.\" He explained, \"Being assigned female at birth, I thought I was a lesbian, even though I hated the word.\u201d[2] Later, he realized that he was transgender at 19 years old, after watching videos produced by transgender people on YouTube. This prompted him to come out as a transgender man in 2013.[2] Ashley began the female-to-male process in January 2014 with hormone therapy. His voice deepened and he quickly grew a beard. About a year later, he had a double mastectomy.[2] Ashley adopted the name Laith (meaning \"lion\" in Arabic) having admired the works of Laith Hakeem. He didn't however drop his name Ashley keeping it as part of his stage name as Laith Ashley.\nAshley attended business school and studied psychology at Fairfield University in Connecticut.[5] He subsequently worked at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, where he worked with LGBT homeless youth as a social worker.[2] He explained in an interview, \"When I was a kid, I\u2019d always wanted to be a performer, singer, dancer \u2014 but as a guy. But then, I didn\u2019t think it was possible. I did what my parents said: went to college, got a 9-to-5 job... and people would always tell me, 'You should model!'\"[6]\n\nCareer[edit]\nModeling career[edit]\nIn January 2014, Ashley began his transition process.[7] Soon after, in 2015, Ashley organized a photo shoot with a friend,[6] and he posted the images on Instagram.[8] The images caused viral attention,[8] and many people posted negative comments. He was on the verge of deleting his Instagram account due to the negative comments, but Laverne Cox then reposted his images on her account. This helped inspire him to continue his online presence.[9][10] Since that time, Ashley has modeled for a variety of venues and campaigns, including Barneys (photographed by Bill Weber),[11] in Calvin Klein and in Diesel (shot by David LaChapelle) becoming the first-ever transgender man to be featured in a Diesel campaign.[2] Laith Ashley has also appeared on the covers of renowned fashion and lifestyle publications including in British GQ, Vogue France, Out Magazine,[3] Elle UK,[11] Attitude UK[12] Gay Times, FTM Magazine[13] and Cassius,[14] amongst others. In June 2016, Laith was featured in Attitude UK as the magazine's Summerwear and Underwear Special.[15] He appeared in a number of fashion shows including the Gypsy Sport catwalk at New York Fashion Week[5] and the Marco Marco Fashion Show at L.A. Style.[16] He is represented by the Slay Model Management agency.\n\nActing and music career[edit]\nIn addition, Ashley has done musical and television work. In 2016, Ashley appeared in Strut, a television program about transgender models, which was produced by Whoopi Goldberg.[6] In June 2018, Ashley performed his music, including his single \"Can't Wait\" at L.A. Pride.[17] The bill included acts such as Jessica 6, Icona Pop, Keke Wyatt, Eve, Cece Peniston, Kim Petras, Jesse Saint John, Allie X, Gio Bravo, Karisma, and Saturn Rising.[18] In September 2018, Ashley released a music video for his song \"Before You Go\".[19][20] Furthermore, in 2018, Ashley became the first transgender member of the pit crew in Rupaul's Drag Race. He appeared in the \"Pants Down Bottoms Up\" mini-challenge in Season 10.[21] In 2019, he collaborated with Kay'Vion on the latter's album Braille releasing jointly the single \"Favorite\".[22]\n\nActivism[edit]\nLaith Ashley is an activist particularly in transgender issues. He worked with FLUX, a division of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is dedicated to raising awareness and providing support to trans and gender-nonconforming people,[23] actively takes part in Pride parades, and has talked on numerous occasions of the dangers of transphobia and visibility of ethnic minorities.[24] He has also appeared in a great number of LGBTQ public awareness campaigns including a high profile campaign by T-Mobile,[25][26] the \"We Are Bold\" campaign by AT&T and GLAAD[27] He has also talked about challenges of transitioning, about bullying, racism and very notably the visibility of transgender people in the modelling industry.\nIn a lengthy interview with The Huffington Post titled \"I Am Trans, But It\u2019s Not All I Am\", Laith Ashley said he aspired to be more than just a transgender man. \"I try to be open, more open than others may be. I try to think of it as a cis gender person who is looking at their gender as another other than their own, and if this is something they have never thought about or researched. It\u2019s normal that they will have a lot of questions, it\u2019s just how you ask them. You have to at least be sensitive. I think it\u2019s important to talk about it but we want to let people know we are people just like everyone else. Don\u2019t put us on display and under a spotlight and make it uncomfortable. I want to show everyone that yes I am trans, but its not all that I am. The same goes for all trans people. Everyone\u2019s transition is their own; my story, my transition, my identity is my own. Everyone\u2019s identity, trans or not, is their own... There are people that went male/female or female/male and people that are in between. I think before I was in the industry and working with the LGBT industry, I was very on the masculine spectrum; Now I feel more fluid.\"[28]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nDate\n\nSeries\n\nRole\n\nEpisode\n\n\n2016\n\nI Am Cait\n\nHimself\n\nGuest in the reality show / Docuseries in \"Partner Up\" episode[29]\n\n\n2016\n\nStrut\n\n\n\n6 episodes[30]\n\n\n2018\n\nRu Paul's Drag Race\n\nTrans model (in the pit crew)\n\n\"Breastworld\" [31][32]\n\n\n2018\n\nPose\n\nSebastian\n\n\"Love Is the Message\"\n\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nLOGO\n\nHimself\n\n\"Laith Ashley - The Heartthrob\"[33]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSongs[edit]\n2017: \"Can't Wait\" [17]\n2017: \"Before You Go\" [1][19]\n2018: \"Favorite\" (Kay'Vion feat.

She became a dancer, believing that dance was the true artistic synthesis of art and music.[9]\n\nDance career[edit]\nAfter leaving University, Asmodelle worked briefly as an assistant photographer, while attending dance classes at Sydney Dance Company and also with an Authentic Egyptian Dance instructor. Six weeks after starting belly dance classes she gained work as a dancer.[10]\nAs time passed she worked in many shows both in Australia and Asia. She was typically featured as the variety act for such shows as Esma Duo, Paris by Night, Las Vegas Under Lights and Les Girls.[11] She returned to Australia and worked as a solo belly dancer.\n\nActivism[edit]\nDuring Asmodelle's dance career she travelled to Asian countries and faced many legal difficulties, especially in Singapore where she was detained, because her passport denoted an M (for male).[12] She suffered serious problems with various customs officials and became determined to change the laws in Australia.[13] Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade policy was to deny passports bearing the gender designation F to transgender women who could not demonstrate that they had completed sex reassignment surgery.[14]\nAsmodelle continually sent letters and requests to the Attorney's General's Department of the Australian Government and eventually received confirmation that her requests were answered.[15] Others had also been lobbying for changes to the New South Wales government, especially the Attorney-General of N.S.W., for the right to amend birth certificates. Asmodelle was the first person to have her birth certificate amended in this way.[16] Months later, as a result of this action, passport sex designation was allowed to be amended as well. A year later Asmodelle lobbied for anti-discrimination laws to be amended and also for the state hospitals ethics boards to allow research into ectopic pregnancy for sex-change women.[17]\nAsmodelle continues to support other trans people who have become public about their transition. In 2015 Estelle offered support Caitlyn Jenner when she came out as trans.[18]\n\nCareer[edit]\nAsmodelle has been featured in a large number of newspaper and magazine articles, including Cleo (May 1987), People (Nov 1985 & 1993), Post (Dec 1988 Sep 1992), Penthouse Forum (1986 & 1991), New Idea (March 1986), She (July 1996), New Woman (June 1992 & 1998), Naughty Sydney (Cover \u2013 November 1991), Tomadachi (June 1991), Wellbeing (May 1989 & 1993), and Nature & Health (November 1997).[19]\nShe made more than 100 radio interviews and dozens of television appearances in Australia and Japan as well, including Where Are They Now? (Channel 7), Sex/Life (Channel 10 TEN), Midday Show with Kerri Anne (Channel 9), World View (NHK Japan), Beat Takeashi (NHK Japan), Good Morning Australia (Channel 10), Day by Day (Channel 9), Vox Populi (SBS), A Current Affair (Channel 10), Midday Show with Ray Martin (Channel 9), and Terry Willisee Tonight (Channel 9).\n\nFilm work[edit]\nAfter the media attention, she garnered considerable publicity in Australia, but decided to live in Japan for a period of four and a half years, where she worked as a model 1988\u20131992.[20] It was there that she made her film debut, a walk in and walk out part, in a film by Japanese director Yoshimitsu Morita. It was made for the local Japanese market and never made it out of Japan.\nOn returning to Australia, her next film was The Enchanted Dance, a documentary film about authentic belly dancing. It went international on video but was not released on DVD.[21]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nPrevious films:\n\n1989 \u2013 Ai to heisei no iro \u2013 Otoko (24 Hour Playboy)[22]\n1992 \u2013 Secret Fantasies\n1994 \u2013 The Enchanted Dance\nModelling[edit]\nEarlier on in her modelling career, she became \"Australia's First Transsexual Pin-up\"[23] by appearing nude in Australian Playgirl. Unlike the US version of the magazine, the publication featured women and not men, and it was the first time a trans woman had appeared nude in a mainstream magazine in Australia.[24] Estelle Asmodelle was the face of the Supermodel Agency in Australia; she was their spokesman and main model during 1996\u20132000.\n\nAbstract art[edit]\nAsmodelle started painting abstract pieces from early childhood and while at Wollongong University, started creating large canvases. Her first solo exhibition was at Wollongong Regional Art Gallery, (now called the Wollongong City Gallery).[25] During her varied career, Asmodelle continued to paint and exhibit, and while living in Japan also exhibited at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum[26] as part of the UNESCO International Friendship Exhibition in 1991. Asmodelle also started the Tokyo Eki (train station) Exhibition, displaying and selling her work in Shinjuku, Ikebukuro and Tokyo.[27]\nAsmodelle was also involved in group shows in Los Angeles, at the Los Angeles Center For Digital Art LACDA.[28] Since returning to Australia, Asmodelle has continued to exhibit in both solo exhibitions in Sydney and country NSW, as well as in group shows, one example is the Redfern Artist Group.[29] Her work has been exhibited in Tokyo, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Sydney and regional NSW.[30] Estelle has had numerous solo shows and participated in over 100 group shows, and her art website details some of her work at 'Abstract Artist'.[31]\nIn 2010 Asmodelle published her first art book, entitled \"Transience\".[32]\nAsmodelle has continued to paint during her varied career, while she usually gains considerable publicity in all her activities. The Art Blog, ran a piece on her in 2016 about her abstract art,.[33] Additionally, she has stated on her profile on Art Finder,[34] that she is to launch another book in 2017 about her abstract art, entitled, \"Symbiosis: Art and Mathematics\". She also has a profile on the Blue Thumb art portal[35]\n\nCareer change[edit]\nWhile modelling in Japan, Asmodelle also worked for several large Japanese technology companies as a technical consultant, these companies were: Mitsubishi, Nachi-Fujikoshi, NSK and Nippon Seiko K.K. It was the start of a career change, returning to an academic life. During that time, she developed several new technology patents. Asmodelle's patents in the Croot name,[36] and Estelle's patents in the Asmodelle name:[37]\nUpon returning to Australia Asmodelle continued her technical consultant work alongside her modelling and painting. Then in 1998 she formed her own internet company, Ellenet Pty. Ltd. Calling on background in computers. According to media reports, Asmodelle has become something of an internet entrepreneur[38] and continues to build a significant online presence.[39] In 2016 Ellenet Pty. Ltd. was sold to Sandgate Solutions in Australia for an undisclosed sum.\nSince 2005 Asmodelle has also been recording composition of electronic music.

Educated at Robert Gordon's College, Aberdeen, she had a generally unhappy and dislocated childhood, including a spell at boarding school, where she was abused. She was an outwardly popular and charismatic child but after suffering years of sexual abuse made worse by her gender dysphoria, she decided to join the British Army to camouflage her real personality.\nAusten joined as an officer in the Royal Irish Rangers in 1982, serving in Northern Ireland.  She retrained as a video journalist in 1986 working for Scottish Television. Her military background saw her dispatched to war zones covering the Gulf War 1, the civil wars in Angola and Afghanistan, and the conflict in Bosnia, as well as service with the United Nations. She then worked as a director and series producer for Scottish and Anglia Television. In 1997 Hamilton was promoted to editor-in-chief of the television division of Mirror Group. After management changes at Mirror Group, she took up a senior management position at Granada TV. She has been nominated three times by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.\n\nRejoining the British Army[edit]\nThis section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources.

As an over-age candidate, she first joined the Territorial Army and then the Regular Army. She joined the Parachute Regiment in 2002, having already passed the stringent selection process at age 35, and went on to attend All Arms Commando Course and Special Forces selection with 22 SAS, becoming a combat survival and a physical training instructor. She served with the Cheshire Regiment and The Highlanders in a variety of command appointments, as well as a number of staff appointments both in the UK and overseas, with a speciality in Information and Psychological Operations. In 2003 she commanded a company from The Parachute Regiment on operations in Iraq. She deployed on operations in Bosnia, Northern Ireland, the War in Afghanistan and  the Iraq War. She returned to the United Kingdom in 2006 and spent a period recovering from two continuous years of operations before taking a position back in Afghanistan with NATO Forces, advising on specialist counter-narcotics operations, from where she was medevacked back to the UK with a serious infection following an IED incident.\n\nForced resignation, 2007[edit]\nSee also: Transgender inequality\nIn 2007, Abigail decided to undergo gender normalisation, in accordance with her desire to live as a female.\nTransgender individuals in the UK are protected under a number of legislative acts, including the Sex Discrimination Act Amendments (1999) and the Gender Recognition Act (2004), which make it illegal to treat a person differently on the grounds of gender alone, with the aim of protecting the rights of trans-people in the work-place. Although other people in the Royal Navy and Air Force have successfully transitioned in the service, as the first officer and first paratrooper, Austen's background caused considerable surprise to the Army, particularly in the light of constant media attention. At that time, the British military did not have regulations in place to support Austen's continued service with Airborne Forces. This led to a lengthy and public legal dispute.\nThe issue was eventually amicably resolved, and Austen resigned her commission. Austen's case led to Army policy on transgender soldiers being formalised for the first time which now allows soldiers to transition while in service. The Regimental Colonel of The Parachute Regiment wrote to Austen to thank her for her \"years of loyal service as an Airborne Officer\".[2]\n\nPresent day[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

The film continues to be shown around the world and formed the basis for a biographical film based on her life, produced by the Japanese TV company NHK.\nShe continues to undertake a number of training and advisory roles on gender issues, including with Lancashire Police. She continues to support the Parachute Regiment by fundraising for Airborne Charities.\nAfter leaving military service, Austen served as a police officer with Strathclyde Police in Glasgow, setting the first Scottish legal precedents for transphobic crimes and as the UK lead on development of diversity awareness for the national police service. She is an instructor with the Army Cadet Force, mentoring troubled young people from her police ward.\nIn 2012, she returned to Afghanistan political advisor to US Forces in Southern Afghanistan. She served three years on back-to-back tours with the US 82nd Airborne, 3rd and 4th infantry divisions and was awarded a number of prestigious decorations for her work.\nShe then moved to Ukraine, as deputy ambassador and senior diplomatic spokesperson for the European Union mission.\nAusten was then appointed as senior advisor to the UK's Standing Joint Deployable Headquarters, creating policy for the 9-nation coalition Joint Expeditionary Force defending NATO's eastern flank.\nShe maintains a lecturing role to U.K. and US military staff colleges, specialising in conflict resolution and stabilisation.\nFollowing her experiences in Kandahar, she wrote the book Lord Roberts' Valet (ISBN\u00a01517204836) and began a career strand as producer and presenter of her own television documentaries. In 2017, Austen's Channel 4 documentary, based on her experiences in Afghanistan, won a Creative Diversity Network award. 'Lord Roberts\u2019 Valet' is currently[when?] in development as a film with a major broadcaster. Austen was further nominated as 2017 International Presenter of the Year by the Association of International Broadcasters. Her latest book, 'Sugar and Spice' is slated for publication in 2018.[4][needs update]\n\nControversy[edit]\nAusten was featured in several UK national newspapers, and has made many television and radio appearances.[5]\nIn 2009, Austen was reported extensively in the press, to have secured a \u00a3250,000 pay-out for \"hurt feelings\" from the MoD. She received several threats of violence from serving soldiers because of the attendant publicity of this case. The Mail Online and Evening Standard said in a retraction that  Austen had \"neither sought nor received \u00a3250k for hurt feelings.\"[6] Austen insisted that they make a sizeable donation to service charities to compensate for the hurt done to the families of injured service personnel.[citation needed]\nIn 2017, she made several media appearances countering President Trump's direction on banning trans individuals from service with the US military.[citation needed]\n\nSee also[edit]\nTransgender rights in the United Kingdom\nRoberta Cowell\nBritish soldier has sex change \u2013 CNN Video\nCutting Edge \u2013 Channel 4\nSTV Interview\nApartheid era SADF forced sex change operations for Gay/Lesbian soldiers\nmodoracle.com, Austrian Army takes Soldiers case personal\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Alexandra Genova (21 November 2015). \"'The UK's first transgender Army officer full of praise for 'tolerant' Liverpool - where she now calls home\".

She took up golf at the age of eight. At the age of 14, she was pictured with golfer Greg Norman during a golf clinic. Bagger moved with her family to Australia in 1979.[3] In 1992 she started hormone replacement therapy and in 1995, had sex reassignment surgery.[3][8] In 1998 she returned to competitive golf as an amateur in Australia. She was open about her life and played in various amateur events around Adelaide and was invited to join the women's South Australian State Squad.[3] After winning the 1999 South Australian State Amateur the media attention increased.[3]\nBagger played for the state team of South Australia (1999\u20132002) achieving a national top-ten rank for amateur women.[3] Various players from time to time, were still concerned about Bagger having an \"unfair advantage\"[3] The suspicion was that \"if I happen to do well or win a tournament, that it was because of an unfair advantage.\"[3] She had researched the issues herself and, also through personal experience, realised that concerns were unfounded. All organizations that prevented her from competing had never actually done any research but had merely adopted a blanket ruling without question.[3] Bagger answered that many people are not aware of physiological aspects of gender variant conditions and the issues related to transitioning. Bagger again won the South Australian Amateur in 2001 and 2002.\nBagger felt she had taken her amateur career as far as it could go and was looking to turn professional. She found that rules would prevent her from competing professionally in Australia and \"on most golf tours around the world.\"[3] While still an amateur, she was offered the chance to play in the 2004 Women's Australian Open.[3] This led to a front-page story in Sydney, which prompted Bagger to hold a news conference the day before the tournament to answer questions and present information on transitioned and transgender people.[3]\n\nProfessional career and campaigning for trans rights[edit]\nAfter becoming the 6th best player in Australia in 2003, she turned a professional golfer.\n\nIn 2004 she played the Swedish Telia Tour and finished twice in the top 10.\nIn 2005 she played her first tournament on the Ladies European Tour. She finished in the 35th place\nIn 2006 she finished on the 91st place\nIn 2007 she finished as 54th\nHer coach is Australian Andrew Mowatt at the Royal Fremantle GC in Perth.\nAt Bagger's first tournament as a professional, Laura Davies and Rachel Teske were among players who were happy to allow Bagger to compete.[8] Bagger caused a media stir in 2004 when she played the Australia Women's Open and had intentions also of joining the Australian Ladies Professional Golf Tour (ALPG Tour).[9] At a tournament in the United States, she met Ty Votaw, the commissioner of the LPGA Tour, who was later questioned about their policies stating \"right now, our rule is that they have to be born women.\" Bagger notes that \"they obviously don't consider that I meet that condition.\"[10] Her comment reflects current medical findings that there are no physical advantages for transitioned women in the sport. Votaw left the possibility open for that rule to change in the future.\nThe 2004 ruling by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) regarding transitioned athletes led to a re-examination of rules in many sports.[11] The IOC 2004 Stockholm Consensus, which researchers have criticized as \"a measure that polices the traditional gender binary while being disguised as a progressive and inclusive measure,\" spells out specific requirements for a transitioned athlete.[3][12][13][14] Bagger notes that the USGA policy requires \"a signed waiver by the entrant giving complete and unrestricted access to one\u2019s medical records and pre-operative and post-operative psychiatric records\"[3] \u2013 requirements that are unheard of for other competitors.[3]\nIn September 2004, after continued lobbying by Bagger, the Ladies European Tour voted on amending their membership entry criteria, allowing Bagger to compete on tour. Later that year, the ALPG also voted in favour of changing their constitution to remove the 'female at birth' clause, thus making Bagger eligible to join the ALPG Tour in Australia. On 9 February 2005, the Ladies Golf Union also announced a policy change allowing Bagger to compete in the Women's British Open. On 21 March 2005, the United States Golf Association announced it adopted a new 'gender policy' that allows transitioned athletes to compete in USGA golf championships, including the upcoming U.S. Women's Open. In 2010, the LPGA amended their bylaws and removed the 'female at birth' entry condition. Although the various policy changes have enabled transitioned athletes to compete, the policies remain under review.[11][15] Bagger, along with a few high-profile athletes and a growing number of medical professionals and researchers around the world, continue to lobby the IOC, IAAF, WADA et al. in their approach to embracing transitioned athletes.[11] Bagger also shares that many of these decisions are made by popular vote of members, often professionals in their sport, who are not doctors or medical professionals, and have no relevant medical training.[3]\n\nAmateur wins[edit]\n1999 South Australian Ladies Amateur\n2000 South Australian Business Women's Championship\n2001 South Australian Ladies Amateur, South Australian 72 Hole Strokeplay Championship (Rene Erichsen Trophy)\n2002 South Australian Ladies Amateur\nSee also[edit]\nTransgender people in sports\nSex verification in sports\nNotes[edit]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Ladies European Tour profile\".

Bailey served her mayoral term from 2007\u20132008. Bailey became a member of the city council in 2002, when she was elected to represent the suburb of East Chesterton within Cambridge. She served the council continuously from 2002\u20132007, rising the ranks until she was chosen to become mayor in 2007.[1] Prior to her appointment as full mayor, she acted as a deputy in 2006.\nShe was the first transgender mayor in the United Kingdom,[2] but not the first in the world as Georgina Beyer, also a trans woman, became Mayor of Carterton, New Zealand in 1995.[3] Bailey herself was keen to play down the significance of her appointment, saying, \"I don't want to let it define me.\"[4] Bailey had undergone gender transitioning 11 years prior to assuming office in the council.[1]\nBailey was married before her transition, and became a parent to two sons. Bailey and her longtime companion Jennifer Liddle entered into a civil partnership on 22 September 2011.[5] Liddle, a former councillor,[2] is also a trans woman.\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n2 Political activity\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBailey was born in Doncaster Prison, where her father worked as a prison officer. She was brought up at Doncaster prison camp, and has said that her own confusion about her gender arose as early as aged 6 or 7.[4] In school, Bailey joined the radio club led by her physics teacher and decided to follow this interest in her professional working life. Aged 20, she received a sponsorship from local company Pye Telecom to take part in a three-year training course. This involved placements at Lanchester Polytechnic, colleges in Coventry and industrial training in Cambridge.[1] Bailey worked in several jobs as a telecommunications engineer before becoming involved in politics.\nIn her 20s, she had to further suppress her confusion over her gender as she married a cisgender woman and became a parent to two sons. However, the marriage met with an amicable demise soon after; Bailey maintained a relationship with her former wife and upon hearing that Bailey was to be sworn in as mayor, her former wife said that she was \"incredibly proud\".[6] She began hormone replacement therapy in 1990, aged 29.[citation needed] There she met her current partner, Jennifer Liddle, who also worked as a software engineer and was also undergoing gender transitioning. Bailey had sex reassignment surgery in 1993.\nBailey follows the Buddhist religion and is a vegetarian in accordance with these beliefs.[1] On 22 September 2011 Bailey and Liddle entered into a civil partnership at Cambridge's Shire Hall.[5]\n\nPolitical activity[edit]\nBailey made the decision to enter politics in the early 2000s, later saying that her ambition to make a contribution to local life was the biggest incentive behind this career choice.[6] She became a councillor for the Liberal Democrats in 2002 after being elected to represent East Chesterton. Bailey had long taken an interest in environmental issues and made them a feature of her tenure in office; promoting cycling, waste management, recycling, and advocating the use of public transport; as well as implementing several schemes to aid local residents in these activities. She served as a school governor for Chesterton Community College for a short period.[1]\nIn 2004, she was appointed as Executive Councillor for Planning and Transportation, and in this role successfully led the Council's new parking enforcement role.[1] She was also re-elected as councillor for East Chesterton, winning  40.7% of the vote; a margin of 2.4% over her partner, Liddle.[7] She was promoted to deputy mayor in 2006, acting as Ceremonial Bailiff to the mayor at select civic ceremonial events.\nAt Cambridge City Council's annual meeting on 24 May 2007, Bailey was appointed mayor for the municipal year of 2007\u20132008, thus becoming the 801st first citizen of Cambridge.[8] Her job as mayor entailed attending approximately 500 social engagements. Bailey chose two charities, Press Relief and the Cambridge Museum of Technology, to be the primary benefactors of the fundraising done throughout her tenure.[8] Bailey also vowed to give recognition to the unsung heroes of the city.\nShe was succeeded by her deputy mayor, Mike Dixon, in 2008.\nDespite it being well known among councillors for several years, Bailey's appointment garnered significant media coverage, with Fox News reporting the story in the USA.[9] Bailey, however, said that she did not want the issue to eclipse being mayor.[4]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f \"Cambridge mayors 2000\u20132010\".

Barres (September 13, 1954\u00a0\u2013 December 27, 2017)[1] was an American neurobiologist at Stanford University.[2] His research focused on the interaction between neurons and glial cells in the nervous system. Beginning in 2008, he was Chair of the Neurobiology Department at Stanford University School of Medicine. He transitioned to male in 1997, and became the first openly transgender scientist in the National Academy of Sciences in 2013.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Research\n3 Experience of sexism\n4 Death\n5 Awards and honors\n6 Bibliography\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBarres was born on September 13, 1954, in West Orange, New Jersey, assigned female. As a child, his salesman father and homemaker mother saw him as a tomboy.[4] Attending a West Orange school, Barres excelled in mathematics and science and was impressed by his eighth-grade teacher, Jeffrey Davis.[5][6] At the age of 17, he learned that he had been born with M\u00fcllerian agenesis.[7] He received surgical correction. He obtained a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1976), a medical degree (MD) from Dartmouth Medical School (1979), and a residency in neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine.[8]  During his residency, Barres noted the lack of knowledge about the causes or cures of neurodegeneration. In studying pathology reports, he noticed a correlation between neural degeneration and irregular patterns of glial cells in the brain and, intrigued, resigned his residency to pursue research in neuroscience at Harvard.[9] He completed a PhD in Neurobiology there in 1990, then did postdoctoral training at University College London under Martin Raff.[10] In 1993, Barres joined the faculty of Neurobiology at the Stanford School of Medicine. After transitioning to male in 1997,[11] Barres published on sexism in the sciences and, in 2008, was appointed to the Chair of Neurobiology at Stanford.[2]\n\nResearch[edit]\nBarres authored or co-authored papers in journals such as Nature Neuroscience, Neuron, Science, and Cell.[12] His research involved study of mammalian glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), including the exploration of their function and development. Much of his early work was published under his previous name, Barbara A. Barres.\nSome of his earliest work studied vertebrate nervous system development, including how and why many neurons fail to survive shortly after forming connections with their targets. These studies investigated how this programmed cell death, apoptosis, occurred in such a tremendous scale.[13] Additionally, he studied processes such as the prerequisites for and consequences of axon myelination, and the interactions of various signaling molecules such as thyroid-hormone and retinoic acid within the formation of glial cells including oligodendrocytes.[14][15]\nEarly in his time at Stanford, Barres discovered the importance of glial cells in the formation, development, maturation, and regeneration of neurons.[citation needed] His lab also discovered and developed methods for the purification and culturing of retinal ganglion cells and the glial cells with which they interact, including the oligodendrocytes and astrocytes of the optic nerve.[citation needed]\nNear the turn of the 21st century he continued his study of glial cells and the mechanisms behind their ability to generate new neurons. He studied control of synapses by glia, and the differentiation of astrocytes by endothelial cells. He investigated the role of the protein Id2 in the control of oligodendrocyte development and established that removing this protein led to premature oligodendrocyte maturation.[16]\nIn the 2010s Barres's research focused on using techniques such as immunopanning, immunohistochemistry, tissue culturing, and patch clamping to: 1) understand the cell-to-cell interactions in the developmental regulation of nodes of Ranvier and myelin sheaths; 2) determine to what extent glial cells play a role in synapse formation and function of synapses; 3) identify the signals that promote retinal ganglia growth and survival, and how such knowledge of these signals could be regenerated post-trauma; 4) identify the functions and developmental mechanisms of gray matter astrocytes. In these objectives, his lab discovered a number of novel glial signals for the induction of myelination, axonal sodium channel clustering, and synapse formation processes. Additionally, his lab characterized these processes and the exact identity of these novel signals.[12]\n\nExperience of sexism[edit]\nBarres described experiences of gender discrimination at academics (Matilda effect) in MIT. After solving a difficult math problem that stumped many male students, his professor charged that it was solved for him by a boyfriend.[17] He was the top student in the class, but found it hard to get a willing supervisor for research. He lost a scholarship to a man who had only one publication, while he already had six.[18] While earning a PhD at Harvard, he was told that he was to win a scientific competition, which was evidently between him and one man; the Dean confided to him, \u201cI have read both applications, and it\u2019s going to be you; your application is so much better.\u201d But the award was given to the man, who dropped out of science a year later.[19]\nAfter transitioning, he noticed that people who were not aware of his transgender status treated him with respect much more than when he presented as a woman.[20] After delivering his first seminar as a man, one scientist was overheard to comment, \u201cBen Barres gave a great seminar today, but his work is much better than his sister\u2019s [believing Barbara to be his sister] work.\u201d[21] In 2012, he recollected the events of his sex change:[22]\n\nWhen I decided to change sex 15 years ago I didn't have role models to point to. I thought that I had to decide between identity and career. I changed sex thinking my career might be over. The alternative choice I seriously contemplated at the time was suicide, as I could not go on as Barbara.\nBarres was critical of economist Lawrence Summers and others who have claimed that one reason there are fewer women than men in science and engineering professorships might be that fewer women than men had the very high levels of \"intrinsic aptitude\" that such jobs required.[20] He spoke and wrote openly about being a trans man and his experiences transitioning gender identity in 1997,[23] and his experiences of being treated differently as a female scientist versus a male scientist.[24]\n\nDeath[edit]\nBarres died on December 27, 2017, some 20 months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,[25] at his home in Palo Alto, California. He was survived by two sisters and a brother.[26][8]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nBarres's research awards include a Life Sciences Research Fellowship, the Klingenstein Fellowship Award, a McKnight Investigator Award,[27] and a Searle Scholar Award.  He has also won teaching awards: the Kaiser Award for Excellence in Teaching, and the Kaiser Award for Innovative and Outstanding Contributions to Medical Education. In 2008 he received the Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award.[28] He is inducted member of the Reeve Foundation International Research Consortium on Spinal Cord Injury.[29] He is a co-founder of Annexon Biosciences, Inc., a company making drugs to block neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases.[30] He became a member and elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2011.[31] In 2013 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences,[32] becoming the first openly transgender member.[3] Along with biochemist Tom Jessell, he was awarded the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience at the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) 2016 conference in San Diego.[33]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nKnowland, Daniel; Arac, Ahmet; Sekiguchi, Kohei J.; Hsu, Martin; Lutz, Sarah E.; Perrino, John; Steinberg, Gary K.; Barres, Ben A.; Nimmerjahn, Axel; Agalliu, Dritan (2014). \"Stepwise Recruitment of Transcellular and Paracellular Pathways Underlies Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown in Stroke\".

(June 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nBaty was born in Stanwix, Cumberland, England, to a middle-class family. At school, he was a very gifted student and he was given a scholarship to study at The Queen's College, Oxford. He entered that establishment in 1888, and got his bachelor's degree in Jurisprudence in 1892. In June 1901 he received the degree of LL.M. from Trinity College, Cambridge.[3] He got his D.C.L. from Oxford in 1901 and his LL.D. from Cambridge in 1903. His expertise was in the field of international law. He taught law at Nottingham, Oxford, London and Liverpool Universities. At that time, he became a prolific writer on international law.\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War, Baty took part in the establishment of the Hugo Grotius Society, established in London in 1915. As one of the original members of that society, Baty got to know Isaburo Yoshida, Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in London and an international law scholar from the graduate school of the Tokyo Imperial University. The Japanese government was searching at that time a foreign legal adviser following the death of Henry Willard Denison, a US citizen who served in that position until his death in 1914. Baty applied for that position in February 1915. The Japanese government accepted his application, and he came to Tokyo in May 1916 to start his work. In 1920, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, third class, for his service as a legal adviser.[4] He renewed his working contracts with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs several times, until in 1928 he became a permanent employee of that ministry. In 1936, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, second class.[5]\nDuring his work for the Japanese government, Baty developed the notion that China was not worthy of recognition as a state under international law, a view that was later used to justify invasion of China.[1]\nIn 1927, he was part of the Japanese delegation to the Geneva Naval Conference on disarmament. This was his only public appearance as legal adviser to the Japanese government, as the rest of his work involved mainly writing legal opinions. In 1932, following the Japanese invasion of north China and the formation of Manchukuo, Baty defended the Japanese position in the League of Nations and called to accept the new state to league membership. He also wrote legal opinions in defense of the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.[6]\nIn July 1941, the Japanese government froze the assets of foreigners residing in Japan or any of its colonial possessions in retaliation for the same move against Japanese assets in the US, but Baty was exempt from this due to his service for the Japanese government. Baty decided to remain in Japan even following the outbreak of war between that country and the British Empire in December 1941. He rejected the efforts by the British Embassy to repatriate him back to his country, and kept working for the Japanese government even during the war. He defended the Japanese policy of conquest as a remedy to western colonialism in Asia. In late 1944, he questioned the legitimacy of the pro-Allied governments established following the end of the German occupation in Belgium and France.\nFollowing the Japanese surrender in 1945, the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs was considering indicting Baty for treason, but the Central Liaison Office (a British government agency operating in Japan) provided an opinion stating that Baty's involvement with the Japanese government during the war was insignificant. In addition, some legal advisers within the British government shielded Baty from possible prosecution on the grounds that he was too old to stand trial. Instead, the British government decided to revoke Baty's British nationality and leave him in Japan. He died in Ichinomiya, Chiba, Japan, on 9 February 1954.\n\nLegal philosophy[edit]\nBaty's legal philosophy evolved as he worked for the Japanese government and was designed to justify Japanese actions of encroaching upon the sovereignty of China. His main argument was that the recognition of states must depend on one factor alone \u2014 effective control by the military and security forces of the government over the state's territory, and not on preconceived definitions of what the state should be. For that reason he opposed the procedure of according de facto recognition, claiming that only final and irrevocable recognition must be used, and accusing the western international community of hypocrisy in using the de facto recognition as a means to allow some transactions with governments of states unfriendly to him without making the definite commitment to accept him fully into the family of nations.[7]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBaty never married. Some evidence suggests that he hated sex, as he was disillusioned with Victorian sexual norms and disgusted by the then accepted notions of male domination over women.[8] He described himself as a radical feminist and a pacifist.[2]\nIn 1916, along with Esther Roper and Eva Gore-Booth, Baty, using the name Irene Clyde, founded Urania, a privately circulated journal which expressed his pioneering views on gender and sexuality, opposing the \"insistent differentiation\" of people into a binary of two genders.[9][10][11] Baty lived out the gender non-conforming principles promoted by Urania, and for this reason is sometimes remembered as non-binary,[12] transgender or as a trans woman when discussed in connection with Urania.[10][11][13] He also wrote under the name Theta.[14]\nAn important person in his life was his sister, who went with him to Japan in 1916, and lived with him until her death in 1944.[citation needed]\nBaty was a strict vegetarian since the age of 19; he was later Vice-President of the British Vegetarian Society.[15]\n\nWorks[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nAs Thomas Baty\nInternational Law in South Africa (1900)\nInternational Law (1909)\n(with John H.

Beatie had gender reassignment surgery in March 2002 and became known as \"the pregnant man\" after he became pregnant through artificial insemination in 2007.[3] Beatie chose to be pregnant because his wife Nancy was infertile, doing so with cryogenic donated sperm.[4][5] Beatie has since given birth to four children.\nThe couple filed for divorce in 2012.

Beatie's mother was from San Francisco, and of English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent. His father, of Korean and Filipino descent, was born and raised in Hawaii.[6][page\u00a0needed]\nBeatie writes that he started to self-identify with the male gender at age ten.[7] As a teenager, Beatie was a model and Miss Hawaii Teen USA pageant finalist.[8]\nIn 1996, Beatie graduated from the University of Hawaii with a bachelor's degree in health science (pre-med) and later pursued an Executive MBA. He competed in full-contact fighting and was a black belt and tournament champion in Taekwondo.[9][10]\n\nTransition[edit]\nIn March 2002, Beatie underwent sex reassignment surgery involving a double mastectomy,[11] also known as \"top surgery\",[3] and officially changed his sex marker from \"female\" to \"male\" on his state and federal identity documents.[3][12] Prior to marriage he legally changed his name.\nBeatie married Nancy Gillespie in Hawaii on February 5, 2003.[13] The couple moved to Bend, Oregon in 2005.[6][page\u00a0needed] When the two decided to start a family, Beatie chose to carry the child, since Nancy was unable due to a prior hysterectomy.[14] He was able to become pregnant, having retained his female reproductive organs.[15] Beatie suspended testosterone hormone treatment in order to conceive twice with donor sperm, delivering both children without complications.[16]\nIn February 2012, Beatie elected to have \"lower\" surgery, including the creation of a functional penis.[3] The procedure, performed by transgender surgeon Marci Bowers,[17] was documented on his second appearance of The Doctors, in 2012.[18] The procedure, called a ring metoidioplasty, included transfer of tissue, elongation of the hormonally enlarged phallus, as well as urethral construction and lengthening.[19]\n\nPublic profile[edit]\nBeatie received intense media attention after he wrote a first-person article in the national LGBT magazine The Advocate in 2008.[14][11] He wrote, \"our situation sparks legal, political, and social unknowns [...] Doctors have discriminated against us, turning us away due to their religious beliefs\".[6]:265\u20136[4][15] The article was accompanied by a shirtless photograph of the pregnant Beatie,[11] which became an object of voyeurism among the public according to the queer theorist Jack Halberstam.[14] Within weeks of the online publication, news of his story quickly spread through national[20][21] and international media,[22] who dubbed Beatie \"the pregnant man\".[3][12]\nThe media attention challenged many people's ideas about sex and gender, and attracted criticism of Beatie's identity and motives. Sociologist Lisa Wade wrote, \"I'm not sure what to make, sociologically, of the attention that Thomas' pregnancy is receiving in the mass media, but it is ripe for analysis\".[3] Many media outlets treated Beatie's pregnancy as a \"freak show\", according to media scholar Andre Cavalcante.[11] The story helped promote transgender issues in the media; other trans men had given birth before Beatie, but were neither reported on nor legally recognized as male.[16]\n\nIn April 2008, Beatie made his first television appearance, an hour-long exclusive interview, on the Oprah Winfrey Show.[23] During the show, he talked about his sense of reproductive right to bear a child independent of his male gender identity. He commented, \"It's not a male or female desire to want to have a child [...] it's a human desire [...] I'm a person, and I have the right to have my own biological child.\"[16][11][24] The Oprah episode received a spike in Nielsen ratings.[25] In the April 14, 2008, edition of People (magazine), Beatie was photographed by Mary Ellen Mark for a six-page story.[26][27]Beatie delivered his first child, Susan, on June 29, 2008.[3] Multiple tabloids, magazines, and other news outlets reported the story after paparazzi captured images of the family leaving the St. Charles Medical Center in Bend, Oregon days later.[28][29] People's senior editor, Patrick Rogers, gave an interview to the CBS Early Morning Show about the birth.[30] People's August 4, 2008, edition featured Beatie with his daughter, Susan, sharing the cover with a larger image of Barack Obama, who at the time was a presidential candidate in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, posing with his family.[31][32]\nOn November 13, 2008, journalist Barbara Walters announced on The View that Thomas was expecting his second child, Austin Alexander Beatie.[33] The next day, ABC aired a 20/20 Barbara Walters primetime interview (\"Journey of a Pregnant Man\") with the Beaties.[34][35] During the interview, Walters showed a series of photographs of Beatie, commenting on the \"disturbing\" nature of the images, many of which highlighted his pregnant belly.[14]In June 2009, Beatie gave birth to his second child, a son.[36] The couple's third child, a second son was born in July 2010.[37][38][39]\nGuinness World Records 2010, named Beatie the \"World's First Married Man to Give Birth\".[3][40] In a TV broadcast from Rome, Italy, Guinness World Records presented him with the title of \"Unico Uomo Incinto al Mondo,\" translated as \"World's First Pregnant Man.\"[41]\nOther TV appearances for Beatie include Larry King Live with Larry King,[42] The View,[43] Good Morning America,[44] Anderson Live with Anderson Cooper,[45] Oprah: Where Are They Now?,[46] and repeat features on The Doctors[18][47] and Dr. Drew.[48][49] Beatie has made personal appearances on over a dozen hit international TV talk shows in other countries such as Spain, Greece, Germany, Italy, Romania, Russia, Japan, Sweden, Poland, and the UK.[9]\nBetween August and November 2016, he was a contestant in the tenth season of Secret Story, the French adaptation of Big Brother; his secret was \"I'm the first pregnant man ever\". He placed 2nd of all the contestants with 28% of the televote in the final.\nBeatie owns a website and T-shirt company featuring the slogan \"Define Normal\",[3] and has given keynote speeches at colleges and universities.[50][51]\n\nLegal precedent and divorce[edit]\nBeatie filed for legal separation from his wife Nancy in 2012.[52] Shortly afterward, Nancy converted the motion to a divorce. News of the break-up with his wife was leaked to tabloids during an April taping of the talk show The Doctors.[53] Nancy was restricted to two-hour supervised visits with the children three times per week.[54] Thomas was awarded temporary sole custody of his three children and ordered to pay alimony to Nancy.[55][56]\nDuring the divorce proceedings, the presiding judge stated that because Beatie had given birth to the couple's children, he was legally female and therefore the marriage was not recognized in the state.[12] Arizona Superior Court Judge Douglas Gerlach issued a nunc pro tunc Order questioning whether the Court had jurisdiction over the matter. The Beatie case was the first of its kind on record, where a documented legal male gave birth within a traditional marriage to a woman, and the first time a court challenged a marriage based upon a husband giving birth.[57][58] At the time, Arizona did not legally recognize same-sex marriage, so if Beatie were found to be female according to Arizona statute, the ten-year Beatie marriage would not be recognized in that state.[59]\nBeatie's attorneys at the Cantor Law Group filed a memorandum showing that under Arizona State Statute, a transgender man's legal definition is set by certain medical operations, treatments, and finally a certified doctor's approval. \"Since Arizona and Hawaii have virtually the same Sex Change Statute, in this case we will prove that under the law Thomas was a man at the time of his wedding. Sterilization is not a requirement of either State's Statute. Under both Arizona's and Hawaii's law Thomas was a man at the time of his marriage, and therefore his three children born during the marriage are legitimate,\" stated attorney, David Michael Cantor. Judge Gerlach ordered an Evidentiary Hearing and Oral Argument[56] for which the Transgender Law Center filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the Beaties' marriage, stating that the case could be significant regarding marriage, divorce, and reproductive rights for transgender people in the state of Arizona and around the country.[60] Expert testimony was provided by Beatie's sex-reassignment surgeon, Dr. Michael Brownstein M.D., in which the doctor implied that gender is more psychological than chromosomal. He also attested that the chest reconstruction procedure Beatie had undergone qualified as a sex-change surgery.[61]\nIn 2013, a trial was heard to determine custody, child support, and division of property and debts, even though Arizona is not a common-law state.[62][63] Despite the marriage's being put into question, the courts proceeded with custody arrangements for the children because both Beatie and Nancy legally adopted each of their three children in Oregon, in the Oregon court orders, Thomas was also listed as \"father\" and Nancy was listed as \"mother\" on each birth certificate, and each spouse had equal parental rights to custody.[64]\nThe court ruled that it had a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction to grant the Beaties a divorce and that Arizona did not have to comply with accepting out-of-state birth or marriage certificates. Despite medical testimony stating otherwise, Judge Gerlach did not consider gender identity, hormone treatment, and chest reconstruction as a valid sex-change surgery, as grounds for successful gender transition. \"If adopted, (it) would lead to circumstances in which a person's sex can become a matter of whim and not a matter of any reasonable, objective standard or policy, which is precisely the kind of absurd result the law abhors.\" Beatie's attorney said the judgement contained several errors.[62][65] The court also ruled to give Nancy joint legal decision-making, physical custody and equal parenting time, ordering Beatie to pay her nearly $240 per month in child support. Since the marriage was not considered valid in Arizona alimony was not further enforced, though the division of property was.[66]\nHowever, in 2014, an Arizona Appeals Court declared that the marriage of the Beaties was valid and therefore they can get divorced, stating that Beatie should not have had to be sterilized in order to be legally recognized as a man in Arizona or Hawaii.[67]\nBeatie remarried to Amber Beatie and now lives in Phoenix, Arizona. Together they have one child, which she carried.[68][69]\n\nLGBT activism[edit]\nIn 2000\u20132001, Beatie was the co-chair and media chair for the Civil Unions-Civil Rights Movement in Honolulu, Hawaii, a non-profit LGBT organization for marriage equality. He helped organize and implement an island-wide, seven-day, 110-mile March for Equality.[70][71] He also lobbied to pass the state's first Hate Crimes Law[72][73](which passed in June, 2001), and worked as an advisor for the city and county's Chapter 19, an anti-bullying policy for the Board of Education.[74]\nIn August 2011, he was the main opening speaker for Stockholm Pride, speaking to an audience of tens of thousands. He also spearheaded one-on-one discussions with doctors, politicians, and policy-makers in support of abolishing the sterilization law for Swedish transgender people.[75][76][77] Sweden's forced sterilization law for transgender people was overturned on December 19, 2012.[78]\n\nCultural impact[edit]\nBeatie has challenged social and legal definitions of what constitutes being a man or a woman.[79][1] People Magazine defines him as a pop culture icon in the magazine's special edition \"Pop Culture: 1000 Greatest Moments 1974 - 2011.\"[80] His legal case is also a precedent-setter for the ability of transgender people to exercise their constitutional right to reproduce and be recognized as their legal gender post sex-change transition.\n\nSculpture[edit]\nIn May 2010, London sculptor Marc Quinn unveiled a 10-foot marble statue of Beatie when he was pregnant with daughter Susan. Marc Quinn commented, \"I think one of the main things to remember is that media attention and images are of their moment whereas Art is forever\u2026 that in 500 years time people will look at the beautiful marble sculpture of [Thomas] and have an emotional response and it will, I believe, somehow define something about our time.\"[9]\n[81][82]\n\nFilm[edit]\nThe documentary Pregnant Man (2008) documented the final weeks of Beatie's pregnancy and the birth of Susan.[83][84] The documentary was the highest rated show for Discovery Networks for 2008.[85][86][87] The documentary continues to screen worldwide.[88][89]\n\nShort film[edit]\nIn 2015, French director Jan Caplin wrote and directed the short movie Hippocampe, inspired by Thomas Beatie and his wife's attempts to have a child.[90][91]\n\nPublications[edit]\nShortly after Susan was born, Beatie authored his first book, Labor of Love: The Story of One Man's Extraordinary Pregnancy (2008).[6] In Labor of Love, Beatie describes the fight for his right to have a child. Publisher's Weekly said the book was \"A compelling, unique narrative\". Book List praised it as \"Unforced and unpretentious,\" and the New York Times called it \"Defiant and transformative.\"[92]\nOther Works Include\n\nThomas Beatie, \"Labor of Love: Is society ready for this pregnant husband?\" The Advocate[4]\nBook contribution, The New Transsexuals: The Next Step in Human Evolution by George Petros, Thomas Beatie, pp.\u00a034\u201343[93]\nSwedish newspaper contribution to Aftonbladet[94]\nBook contribution, Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation in the Workplace by Christine Duffy[95]\nThomas Beatie, \"Dad v.

Today she resides in Stockholm.[3] Becker is the eldest child of her parents and has two younger brothers.[4]\nWhen discussing her experience growing up transgender, she said she knew she was different and tried to create a dream world where she saw herself as a girl falling in love with a man. In school, she was bullied and received death threats and as a result of the harassment began to drink alcohol, and both starve and cut herself.[4]\n\nCareer[edit]\nShe made her film debut in director Ester Martin Bergsmark's movie Something Must Break (2014)[1] which was based on the novel You Are the Roots That Sleep at My Feet and Keep the Earth in Place by Eli Lev\u00e9n\u00a0[sv].[5] In April 2014, Becker traveled to New York for the premiere showing at the Tribeca Film Festival.[6] For her role as the character Sebastian/Ellie in the film she won a Guldbagge Award for  Best Female Lead Role in 2015 and thereby became the first transgender actress both to be nominated and win a Guldbagge Award.[7][8][9]\nBecker was nominated for a Rising Star Award at the Stockholm Film Festival in 2014.[10] In 2015 Becker became the ambassador for the organization Suicide Zero, an organization that works to prevent suicides.[11] Becker had talked about being suicidal before her gender reassignment operation.[11] Becker will, working with Suicide Zero, focus on transgender and gay people at risk.[11]\nBecker has demanded that the Swedish film industry give more roles to transgender actors and actresses.[12] In March 2015, Becker became the first person to get tested for HIV at the RFSL's new testing station Testpoint in Stockholm as it had its opening day.[13] Earlier, in February 2015, she had been a guest on the TV4 talk show Malou Efter Tio presented by Malou von Sivers.[14]\n\nOn 3 July, 2015, Becker hosted Sommar i P1, broadcast on Sveriges Radio, where she talked about her career and her life as a transgender actress[3] and described her life experience as a transgender person by saying, Sometimes life has edges, sharp jagged edges that can cut ... and I cut myself all the time for it is difficult to live in a world if one does not exist. To deny oneself to fit in is stressful for both the body and the psyche. Not being able to be [myself] could mean the end. I can not lie anymore. This is my truth.[4]\nAwards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nNominee / work\n\nAward\n\nResult\n\n\n2014\n\nSomething Must Break\n\nStockholm Film Festival Rising Star Award\n\nNominated\n\n\n2015\n\nGuldbagge Award, Best Female Lead Role\n\nWon\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Saga Becker Biography\".

She has walked several catwalks for brands including Gypsy Sport at both London and NYC Fashion Weeks. Bergdorf was the first transgender model in the UK for L'Or\u00e9al, but was dropped within weeks after a racial row. In February 2018, she was appointed as an LGBT adviser to the Labour Party, but resigned the following month. Bergdorf appeared in the Channel 4 documentary What Makes A Woman, which aired in May 2018.\nBergdorf won \u2018Changemaker of the Year\u2019 at the 2018 Cosmopolitan Awards,[3] and was awarded an honorary doctorate in 2019 by the University of Brighton.[3] She joined UN Women UK as an advocate in 2019, supporting its #DrawALine campaign, aiming to put a stop to female genital mutilation (FGM).[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Modelling\n\n2.1 Racial controversy\n\n\n3 Activism\n4 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBergdorf was born and grew up in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex.[5][2] Bergdorf is mixed-race, born to an Afro-Jamaican father and a white English mother.[6][2] Bergdorf attended Bentfield County Primary School in Stansted Mountfitchet and then The Bishop's Stortford High School, an all-boys' school. Bergdorf describes growing up as a \"very effeminate boy\". Later, she studied English at the University of Brighton, describing herself there as genderqueer.[2]\nBergdorf then worked for three years in fashion PR. At the age of 24, Bergdorf began gender transitioning,[2] and was the subject of an episode of London Live show Drag Queens of London.[5][7]\nAround the same time that Bergdorf was transitioning, she co-founded nightclub Pussy Palace.[7]\n\nModelling[edit]\nBergdorf became involved in modelling after being motivated by the lack of diversity in the industry. Her first modelling job was for a Lebanese couture company.[2] In 2014, the London Evening Standard referred to her as \"a cornerstone of London's trans scene.\"[5] She told the newspaper that she was \"so vocal\" on trans issues because she sees it as \"the new frontier\", an issue being brought into public consciousness through the work of trans women like Laverne Cox and Carmen Carrera.[5]\nShe came to public attention in August 2017 when she was employed as the first transgender model to front a L'Or\u00e9al campaign in the UK, being announced as one of 27 models taking part in L'Or\u00e9al UK's \"True Match\" campaign.[8][9] On her social media, she stated: \"Thank you L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris for giving me this platform. I hope it reaches another little eight-year-old trans girl and makes her feel a little more hopeful and a little less scared about her future, than what was installed in me when I was her age.\"[9] Elsewhere she stated:  \"I definitely set out to empower girls like me.\"[8]\n\nRacial controversy[edit]\nMain article: Munroe Bergdorf race row incident\nIn February 2017, Bergdorf stated that 'white people as a group are brought up racist', stating: \"most of y\u2019all don\u2019t even realise or refuse to acknowledge that your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour.\"[10] Bergdorf attracted further public attention following an article in The Daily Mail highlighting Facebook comments that she had made, which included the claim that all white people were guilty of \"racial violence\" and that the white race was \"the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth.\" In response to Bergdorf's comments, L'Or\u00e9al dropped her from their campaign on 1 September 2017.[1][11][12][9] They issued a statement that the company \"supports diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion\" and that Bergdorf's comments about white people were \"at odds with those values\".[1] Facebook removed her posts from their website, regarding them as being in contravention to its rules against hate speech. Bergdorf said she also faced online harassment, much of it of a racist and transphobic nature. Other commentators argued that The Daily Mail had quoted her out of context, and that her wider point about white supremacy and white privilege in Western societies was valid and needed wider dissemination. Bergdorf defended her position, arguing that she was angry after the scenes in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and wanted to explain that racism was systemic, and that being racist was not just about attacking people, but failing to take action against the system. She added: \"I don't see how calling out the roots of racism, somehow makes you a racist\", calling the controversy the \"worst time of my life\".[13]\nIn September 2017, the UK-based Illamasqua hired Bergdorf as the face of its Beauty Spotlight campaign, which concerned gender fluidity.[14][15] In a statement, the company described Bergdorf as embodying \"diversity and individuality; she is not scared to be truly herself.\"[14] It added that it did not \"stand or accept any form of racism, but we also believe Munroe\u2019s comments have been edited out of context by a certain media title (who we won't bother naming) without telling a true story\".[15]\nIn June 2020, during the international George Floyd protests, Bergdorf called out L'Or\u00e9al Paris for posting on Instagram that they stood in solidarity with the Black community. She noted that she had never received an apology from L'Or\u00e9al. In response, the company announced that they would create and appoint Bergdorf to a U.K. Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Board.[16] Bergdorf shared on Instagram a number of abusive messages she received on that platform following her appointment.[17]\n\nActivism[edit]\nThe same month she was hired by Illamasqua, Bergdorf gave a verbal performance of Maya Angelou's poem \"Still I Rise\" for a short film directed by Bec Evans and Laura Kirwan-Ashman.[18]\nIn February 2018, she was appointed as an LGBT adviser to the Labour Party,[13] which she resigned from the following month after her previous homophobic and misogynistic comments received attention.[19][20] Bergdorf apologised for her past comments.[19] Bergdorf later blamed \"Conservative media\" for using her as a \"political pawn to bring down Jeremy Corbyn\" and that the Labour LGBT advisory board was being targeted to be shut down, stating \"when I left they went after somebody else, and then when that person left they went after somebody else\" in order to \"discredit Jeremy Corbyn\".[20]\nAs of April 2019, she has made frequent appearances as a guest commentator on ITV's Good Morning Britain and This Morning.\nIn June 2019, Bergdorf was stripped of her role as an ambassador for Childline two days after being appointed, when journalist Janice Turner and others questioned her suitability for the post as somebody who had modelled for adult magazine Playboy.[21][22] Several days later, the NSPCC offered Bergdorf a 'full, frank and unreserved apology' for the way in which it had handled her dismissal. The NSPCC's CEO, Peter Wanless, explained that Bergdorf had been dismissed 'because of her public statements, which we felt would mean that she was in breach of our own risk assessments and undermine what we are here to do'.[23]\nIn July 2019, Bergdorf was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Brighton in recognition of her campaigning for transgender rights.[24]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"L'Oreal sacks first transgender model Munroe Bergdorf\".

They are the two best-known faces of the band.  The band is popular in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, and has toured in the U.S. with The Verve Pipe, Tonic, Alanis Morissette and the Indigo Girls, as well as on their own.\n\nSolo[edit]\nBettens' first solo effort was a mini-album called Go. His first full-length solo album, Scream, was released in Europe on 14 March 2005, and in the USA on 23 August 2005.\nIn March 2007, Bettens released an EP through online music label Fuzz. His second full-length album, Shine, including new mixes of the tracks from the Fuzz EP, was released in 2007. It was produced by Brad Wood. The full CD was distributed for free with 13 October edition of the Flemish newspaper De Morgen in Belgium, which sold 180,000 copies. (Normally the paper sells 95,000 copies.)[1]\nIn 2007, Bettens won an EBBA Award. Every year, the European Border Breakers Awards (EBBA) recognize the success of ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year.\nIn late 2008, Bettens released the album Never Say Goodbye, consisting of recordings of live performances of K's Choice and solo songs, covers, and new songs which had been played during previous tours. The album was only available at concerts and from his online shop.[2]\nThere were plans to license the single \"Come Over Here\" from his LP Scream for episode 409 of the American series The L Word. However, the plans fell through due to problems involving the song's co-writer and record label. The song also appears on the premier Music With a Twist compilation (Sony).\nAfter having played Michigan Womyn's Music Festival in 2006 solo, Bettens organized a band which, at the time, was identified as all-female, for a performance there in 2007.\nIn June 2012, he worked as a firefighter for a year in the Johnson City Fire Department.[3][4]\nBettens has provided vocals for movie soundtracks, including Underworld, Wild Things, Zus and Zo, and Leef!\n\nRex Rebel[edit]\nIn 2018, Sam decides to start a new adventure with the new music group Rex Rebel. They release their album in February, 2020\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nOn 17 May 2019 Bettens came out to the public as a transgender man and had his name changed to Sam.[5][6]; Sam started transitioning in 2019, and was formerly known as Sarah Bettens before he transitioned.[5] In a YouTube video, Bettens said, \"being transgender is not a choice. I always have been, I just didn't know it until now.\" He said he is taking hormone replacement therapy and noted that this would affect his voice and singing, and that he was working with a voice coach.[7] Before coming out as trans, there was a period where he publicly identified as a lesbian (starting in May 2002), and he has had a large lesbian fanbase since the beginning of his career with K's Choice in the 90s.[8][9]\nSam Bettens was born in Kapellen, Belgium. He currently lives in Palm Desert, California, having moved there from Johnson City, Tennessee in 2017, with his partner, two step-children, and two adopted children.[4]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAlbums[edit]\n2004 Go (EP)\n2005 Scream\n2007 Shine\n2008 Never Say Goodbye\nSingles[edit]\n2002 \"Someone to Say Hi To\"\n2002 \"You Always Know Your Home\"\n2004 \"Fine\"\n2005 \"Not Insane\"\n2005 \"Stay\"\n2005 \"Leef\"\n2006 \"Come Over Here\"\n2006 \"I Need a Woman\"\n2007 \"Daddy's Gun\"\n2007 \"I Can't Get Out\"\nDuets[edit]\n1993 \"Why Don't You Try Me (with Frankie Miller)\n1996 \"Not an Addict\" (with Skunk Anansie)\n2016 \"All I Want\" (with Niels Geusebroek)\n2017 \"Mob Wife\" (with a balladeer)\n2020 \"Hat in Hand\" (with a balladeer)\n2000 \"I Alone\" (with Anouk)\nVideo[edit]\nBackstage video of Bettens\n\"I Can't Get Out\"\n\"It's Alright\"\n\"Put It Out for Good\"\nBettens live at l'Elys\u00e9e Montmartre, Paris - part 1\nBettens live at l'Elys\u00e9e Montmartre, Paris - part 2\nNotes and references[edit]\n\n\n\n\n^ \"vrtnieuws.net - De Morgen erg vlot verkocht met cd\". web.archive.org (in Dutch).

They named her after her maternal grandfather, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, who was second in command in the M\u0101ori Battalion. Her parents were living in Hataitai at the time of her birth.[1] She is of European and M\u0101ori (Te \u0100ti Awa, Ng\u0101ti Mutunga, Ng\u0101ti Raukawa, and Ng\u0101ti Porou) descent. Her mother had a second child, Karen, to her first husband in December 1958. Karen was adopted out and few in the family knew that her mother had been pregnant a second time. Beyer was sent to live with her grandparents on their farm in Taranaki during this second pregnancy. Her parents divorced by 1962.[1]\nHer mother married again in 1962. Her mother's second husband was Colin Beyer, a recent law school graduate.[2] The couple moved to Upper Hutt. Beyer, now aged four and a half years, returned to live with her mother and stepfather. A brother, Andrew, was born in December 1963.[3] Beyer attended Upper Hutt Primary School and from age seven, after the family moved to the Wellington suburb of Crofton Downs, Ngaio School.[4] With marital problems developing between her mother and her stepfather, Beyer was sent to Wellesley College boarding school, where she attempted suicide amid feelings of rejection by her parents.[5] From Form 2, she attended the school as a day pupil, as the hostel had closed.[6] After her parents' marriage failed in 1971, financial constraints meant that a private school was no longer affordable, and Beyer attended Onslow College in Form 3.[7] Beyer then moved with her mother and brother Andrew to Papatoetoe to be near family (her brother Raymond lived there, and her sister Joan lived in Glenfield) and friends, with Beyer attending Papatoetoe High School. Before enrolment, a legal name change by deed poll from \"George Bertrand\" to \"George Beyer\" meant that the difference in family name did not have to be explained at school. It was also seen as socially-advantageous for Beyer to be linked to her successful father.[8] Beyer began acting while at that school and decided to make a career out of it, leaving school at 16 (against her mother's will).[9]\nShe lived in Australia for some time, and on her return to New Zealand began seeking work as an actor with increasing success, culminating in a GOFTA award nomination for \"Jewel's Darl\" in 1987. In 1984, Beyer underwent sex reassignment surgery.\nBeyer became a part of the Wellington gay nightclub scene, initially as a singer and drag-queen performer, and later as a sex worker.[10]\nAfter shifting to Carterton, in the Wairarapa, she worked as a radio host. Beyer was the local news presenter and part of the inaugural breakfast crew on radio station Today FM, then owned by Paul Henry.[11]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nLocal politics[edit]\nShe also began to take an interest in local politics, first winning election to a local school board, and subsequently being elected mayor of Carterton in 1995, serving in that role until 2000. This made her the world's first transgender mayor.[12]\n\nParliament[edit]\n\n\nNew Zealand Parliament\n\n\nYears\n\nTerm\n\nElectorate\n\nList\n\nParty\n\n\n1999\u20132002\n\n46th\n\nWairarapa\n\n40\n\nLabour\n\n\n2002\u20132005\n\n47th\n\nWairarapa\n\n23\n\nLabour\n\n\n2005\u20132007\n\n48th\n\nList\n\n35\n\nLabour\n\nAt the 1999 general election, Beyer was selected as the Labour Party's candidate for the Wairarapa electorate. She surprised political commentators to win the typically right-leaning electorate, with a 3,033-vote majority over former colleague and National candidate Paul Henry, to become the world's first transgender  Member of Parliament.\nAt the 2002 election, Beyer re-contested Wairarapa for Labour. She was easily re-elected with an increased majority of 6,372 votes.[13]\nIn a December 2002 interview, Beyer said: \"I get asked questions no other politician would ever have to answer. Regarding the surgery, you know. \u2018Did it hurt?\u2019, or, \u2018When you have sex now as a woman, is it different to how you had sex as a man?\u2019 Well, honey, obviously.\"[14]\nIn her speech to Parliament on the Prostitution Reform Act 2003, Beyer identified herself as a former sex worker. She is credited with influencing three MPs to vote for the Bill, which passed with 60 votes for, 59 against with one abstention.[15]\n\nMaiden speech[edit]\nTraditionally, newly elected MPs have the floor for 10 minutes to introduce themselves to their colleagues. An excerpt from her speech follows:\n\nMr. Speaker, I can't help but mention the number of firsts that are in this Parliament. Our first Rastafarian [N\u00e1ndor T\u00e1nczos]\u2026 our first Polynesian woman\u2026 and yes, I have to say it, I guess, I am the first transsexual in New Zealand to be standing in this House of Parliament. This is a first not only in New Zealand, ladies and gentlemen, but also in the world. This is an historic moment. We need to acknowledge that this country of ours leads the way in so many aspects. We have led the way for women getting the vote. We have led the way in the past, and I hope we will do so again in the future in social policy and certainly in human rights.[16]\nPolitical views[edit]\nIn June 2004, Beyer spoke at the UniQ (Queer Students Association) national conference at Waikato University, Hamilton, where she reiterated her support for the Civil Union Bill. She stated that she did not believe that gay marriage would be legal in New Zealand for at least 20 years, and feared that gay and lesbian New Zealanders were facing a turbulent time in which rights gained since homosexual law reform in 1986 would be questioned and attacked. She became emotional while referring to her internal battle between her membership of the New Zealand Parliament, which she described as the world's oldest \"true\" democracy, and her M\u0101ori heritage, when it came to the seabed and foreshore legislation of May 2004, which she voted in favour of.[17]\n\nHuman rights and gender identity[edit]\nIn 2004, a bill in Beyer's name was drawn from the ballot for members' bills, and introduced to Parliament.  The Bill was intended to add \"gender identity\" to the Human Rights Act 1993, and thereby prohibit discrimination against people because of their gender identity.  The Bill had been Labour Party policy in the 1999 and 2002 election manifestos, and had attracted controversy. Beyer maintained that the Bill ensured human rights for transgender people, and merely clarified existing provisions of the law.  In 2006, the acting Solicitor-General wrote a legal opinion that indicated that transgender people were already within the ambit of the Human Rights Act, and Beyer withdrew her Bill.\n\nRetirement[edit]\nIn early 2004, Beyer announced that she would not stand in the 2005 elections. Tension with her electorate committee, which opposed Beyer's views on the seabed and foreshore, may also have contributed to the decision. In September, Beyer changed her mind. She announced that she would seek a position on the Labour list, without recontesting the Wairarapa seat. She stated that a rally by the conservative Destiny Church the previous month had influenced her decision, as she believed that the message of such rallies must be opposed.\nBeyer resigned from parliament effective from 15 February 2007, and gave her valedictory speech to Parliament on the previous day.[18] The vacant list position was filled by Lesley Soper.\nIn 2010, Beyer stated that she was struggling financially since leaving politics and was applying for welfare.[19][20]\nBeyer was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in 2013, and required dialysis several times a day until she received a kidney transplant.[21] Beyer had a successful kidney transplant in 2017 and has resumed public appearances.[22]\n\n2014 Mana candidacy for Te Tai Tonga[edit]\nOn 27 July 2014 the Mana Party announced that Beyer would stand for Mana in the Te Tai Tonga constituency in the 2014 New Zealand general election.[23] She polled 9.87% of the vote, the fourth-highest total behind Labour, the M\u0101ori Party, and the Green Party, and ahead of only the Legalise Cannabis Party.\nBeyer continues to live with kidney disease,[citation needed] though she reports her health as \"steady\" and welcomes the new challenge. Beyer regarded her 2014 candidacy as \"a way of making amends to M\u0101ori for voting for the foreshore and seabed bill\".[23]\n\nPublic speaking[edit]\n Beyer speaking at a conference in 2006\nBeyer was a keynote speaker at the First International Conference on LGBT Human Rights in Montreal in 2006 and the Second in Copenhagen in 2009, as well as for the Egale Canada Human Rights Trust's annual Gala, held in Toronto on 24 September 2010.\nBeyer was invited as a speaker to a public event at Oxford University's debating society Oxford Union[24] on 23 October 2018[25] and at Cambridge University on 31 October 2018.[26]\n\nHonours and awards[edit]\nIn the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours, Beyer was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to LGBTIQA+ rights.[27]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nLGBT portal\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Georgina Beyer.\n\nHuman rights in New Zealand\nLGBT rights in New Zealand\nProstitution in New Zealand\nSex workers' rights\nTransgender rights in New Zealand\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Beyer & Casey 1999, p.\u00a07.\n\n^ Beyer & Casey 1999, p.\u00a017.\n\n^ Beyer & Casey 1999, p.\u00a018.\n\n^ Beyer & Casey 1999, p.\u00a022.\n\n^ Beyer & Casey 1999, pp.\u00a031\u201332.\n\n^ Beyer & Casey 1999, p.\u00a035.\n\n^ Beyer & Casey 1999, p.\u00a039.\n\n^ Beyer & Casey 1999, pp.\u00a043\u201344.\n\n^ Beyer & Casey 1999, pp.\u00a046\u201348.\n\n^ Materville Studios \u2013 Host of Windy City Times. \"Georgina Beyer: From prostitution to Parliament \u2013 3385 \u2013 Gay Lesbian Bi Trans News Archive \u2013 Windy City Times\".

Billings is the second openly transgender woman to have played a transgender character on television, which she did in the 2005 made-for-TV movie Romy and Michele: In the Beginning.[2] She is also known for portraying the recurring character Davina in the Amazon series Transparent and has played transgender characters in ER, Eli Stone, How to Get Away with Murder, Grey's Anatomy and The Conners.[3][4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Stage work\n2.2 Television and film appearances\n2.3 Teaching\n\n\n3 Activism\n4 Personal life\n5 Filmography\n\n5.1 Film\n5.2 Television\n5.3 Theatre\n\n\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBillings was born in Illinois into a multiracial family; she is of European American, African American and Native American ancestry.[5] Billings' father, Robert Billings, was a music teacher at Los Angeles Harbor College and the musical director for the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, which influenced her interest in theater.[6] She assisted, working backstage with Carol Burnett  and Yul Brynner. She also appeared in Jesus Christ Superstar and The Roar of the Greasepaint\u2014the Smell of the Crowd. In her early life, Billings struggled with homelessness, prostitution, and cocaine and opioid addiction.[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nStage work[edit]\nIn the early 1980s, Billings worked under the stage name Shante at the famed Baton Show Lounge in Chicago, Illinois.[8] Winning a series of beauty contests, she was named Miss Wisconsin, Miss New York, Miss Chicago, Miss Illinois, and Miss Florida. She also served as a judge of the Miss Continental pageant in 2000 and 2001.\nMost of Billings' professional work has been in Chicago theaters, most notably The Bailiwick Theater, Light Opera Works, Court Theatre, and Steppenwolf Theatre. She has collaborated on plays with such notable authors as Larry Kramer, Tina Landau, and Jamie Pachino. She has received one Joseph Jefferson Award and five After Dark Awards for her work in Chicago Theatre. Her one-person autobiographical show has toured to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and off Broadway. She is a former artistic associate of About Face Theatre.\nBillings is also a professional singer who performs in theaters and nightclubs throughout the United States. She recorded her second CD The Story Goes On in 2003. She was a recipient of the New York MAC Hanson Award for Cabaret Artist of the Year in 2004.\nMore recently, Billings has appeared in an autobiographical show, \"S/He and Me.\" [9] In fall 2018, she also appeared in The Nap at Manhattan Theatre Club, and is one of the first openly trans people (if not the first) to be cast in a trans role on Broadway.[10]\nIn September 2019, it was announced that Billings would play the role of Madame Morrible in the Broadway musical Wicked. She is reportedly the first transgender person to star in the show.[11] She previously starred in The Nap on Broadway.[10]\n\nTelevision and film appearances[edit]\nIn the early 2000s, WTTW, the PBS station in Chicago, produced a documentary about Billings' life and career, \"Schoolboy to Showgirl: The Alexandra Billings Story.\" [12]\nShe has appeared in the 2005 made-for-TV movie Romy and Michelle: A New Beginning. She has also played transgender characters in episodes of Karen Sisco, ER, Eli Stone and Grey's Anatomy.[3]\nIn 2010, Billings appeared in the film FAUX, in which she commented on gay marriage spurring the economy.[13]\nIn 2015, Billings appeared on season two, episode six of How to Get Away with Murder as Professor Jill Hartford.[14][15][16]\nIn 2017, transgender actors and actresses, including Billings (with the help of GLAAD and ScreenCrush), were part of a film to Hollywood written by Jen Richards, asking for more and improved roles for transgender people.[17][18]\nIn 2018, Billings played Judge Martha Wallace in the second season of Goliath.\nBillings may be best known for her role as Davina in the Amazon series Transparent. The character was introduced in an early episode of season one and has appeared in subsequent seasons.\nIn 2020, Billings appeared in a recurring role as Robin,[19] a transgender supervisor at Wellman Plastics and mentor to Darlene Conner on ABC's The Conners.\n\nTeaching[edit]\nShe has taught Viewpoints at the Steppenwolf Summer School since 2002 as well as taught at Louis University, The University of Chicago, Illinois University, the Illinois Theatre Convention, Act One Studios, and various classes and workshops around the Chicago area. Currently, she teaches at the Steppenwolf School West in Los Angeles California. Billings is currently a theater professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Before working at USC, she was an assistant professor at California State University, Long Beach.[20] She received her MFA from CSULB, and delivered the commencement speech for CSULB College of the Arts in 2015.[21]\n\nActivism[edit]\nAlexandra Billings is an AIDS and LGBTQ activist who argues for the equality of the LGBTQ community and urges others to use their voices to create change within the LGBTQ community.[20]\nIn 2016, Billings was awarded the Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award, which recognizes outstanding members of the LGBTQ community who live openly and freely in the public eye. After receiving the award, Billings thanked the audience, but also said, \u201cI look around and I see you all and I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you\u2019re here, and I have to say something to you I think you look great, you look swell and it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re here eating the chicken it\u2019s delightful but I must tell you that we have to do something more than sit and speak and talk to our neighbors and eat great food and put on fancy clothes.\u201d\nIn 2017, Transparent, the hit TV show Billings stars in, won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. When accepting the award on behalf of the cast, Billings urged the audience to talk to people who disagree with their beliefs in order to spark conversation and create change instead of staying complacent. Specifically, she called out the older LGBTQ generation and asks them to guide the younger LGBTQ generation because they will be the ones continuing the fight for equality in the future.[22]\nWhen delivering the commencement speech to the graduating class of the California State University, Long Beach in 2015, Billings once again emphasized the importance of voice when she told the students that it is their job is to speak loud, big, and wide in order to spread their voices.[23]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBillings lives in Hollywood, California with her wife Chrisanne, whom she initially met at age fourteen in drama class.[24] They were married in a commitment ceremony in Chicago on December 4, 1995.[8]  Billings was chosen as the Grand Marshal for the Pride Parade in Chicago, Illinois on June 28, 2009.\nBillings has been living with HIV since 1985, and has been an advocate for HIV health initiatives, as well as trans issues and trans rights. When talking about her fight to battle AIDS, she says that she believes the reason she has survived all these years is because of her wife who stood by her, loved her, and supported her through it all.[7] She has spoken about her condition in a number of interviews, including a 2016 article with her hometown paper.[25] She also spoke to POZ Magazine for a 2003 interview about life with HIV.[26]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2007\n\nSocket\n\nDr. Emily Andersen\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\nStealth\n\nVeronica Terranova\n\nShort film\n\n\n2010\n\nFaux\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nValley of Bones\n\nKimberly\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\nFreelancers Anonymous\n\nJaney\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nPaddleton\n\nJudy\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nDisclosure: Trans Lives on Screen\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary film\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2003\n\nKaren Sisco\n\nLois DiNardo\n\nEpisode: \"Nobody's Perfect\"\n\n\n2005\n\nER\n\nMs. Mitchell\n\nEpisode: \"Skin\"\n\n\n2005\n\nRomy and Michele: In the Beginning\n\nDonna\n\nTelevision movie\n\n\n2006\n\nGrey's Anatomy\n\nDonna Gibson\n\nEpisode: \"Where the Boys Are\"\n\n\n2008\n\nEli Stone\n\nJoanna\n\nEpisode: \"Two Ministers\"\n\n\n2008\n\nPretty/Handsome\n\nChristina Carpenter\n\nUnsold TV pilot\n\n\n2014\u20132019\n\nTransparent\n\nDavina Rejennae\n\n23 episodes\n\n\n2015\n\nHow to Get Away with Murder\n\nJill Hartford\n\nEpisode: \"Two Birds, One Millstone\"\n\n\n2015\n\nCapitol Hill\n\nHerself\n\n4 episodes\n\n\n2016\n\nDish Nation\n\nHerself\n\nEpisode 4.152\n\n\n2018\n\nGoliath\n\nMartha Wallace\n\n5 episodes\n\n\n2020\n\nDiary of a Future President\n\nJoy\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n2020\n\nThe Conners\n\nRobin\n\n2 episodes\n\nTheatre[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2018\n\nThe Nap\n\nWaxy Bush\n\nSamuel J.

His parents are entertainers Sonny Bono and Cher, and he became widely known in appearances as a child on their television show, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.[2][3]\nBono is a trans man. In 1995, while then identifying as a woman, and several years after being outed as lesbian by the tabloid press, Bono publicly self-identified as a lesbian in a cover story in a leading American gay monthly magazine, The Advocate. Bono eventually went on to discuss the process of coming out to oneself and others in two books. Family Outing: A Guide to the Coming Out Process for Gays, Lesbians, and Their Families (1998) includes his coming-out account. The memoir The End of Innocence (2003) discusses his outing, music career, and partner Joan's death from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[4]\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Bono underwent female-to-male gender transition. A two-part Entertainment Tonight feature in June 2009 explained that his transition had started a year before.[5] In May 2010, he legally changed his gender and name.[6] A documentary on Bono's experience, Becoming Chaz, was screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and later made its television debut on the Oprah Winfrey Network.[7][8]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Ceremony\n3 LGBT activism\n4 Transition\n5 Filmography\n\n5.1 Film\n5.2 Television\n\n\n6 Bibliography\n7 Notes\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\n Chaz Bono[a] with Sonny Bono in 1974\nBono was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Cher and Sonny Bono of the pop duo Sonny & Cher, stars of a TV variety show on which the young child often appeared. Bono was named after the film Chastity, which was produced by Sonny and in which Cher (in her first solo role in a feature film) played a bisexual woman.[9]\nBono was enrolled at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City.[10] Bono came out to both parents as a lesbian at age 18. In Family Outing, Bono wrote that, \"as a child, I always felt there was something different about me. I'd look at other girls my age and feel perplexed by their obvious interest in the latest fashion, which boy in class was the cutest, and who looked the most like cover girl Christie Brinkley. When I was 13, I finally found a name for exactly how I was different. I realized I was gay.\"[11]\n\nCeremony[edit]\nBono began a short music career in 1988 with the band Ceremony,[4] which released one album, Hang Out Your Poetry, in 1993. The band featured Bono on vocals, acoustic guitar, and percussion. Other members were Steve March Torm\u00e9 (backup vocals), Heidi Shink a.k.a. Chance, Pete McRae, Steve Bauman, Louis Ruiz, and Bryn Mathieu. All but one of the band's songs were written or co-written by Bono, Shink, and Mark Hudson. They used no synthesizers or digital effects on the album; Shink noted, \"We turned our back on technology. [ ... ] It's reminiscent of the 60s, but more a tip of the hat than emulating it. We took the music we love and rejuvenated it, made it 90s.\"[12] Critical reception of the album was lukewarm, with Roch Parisien of Allmusic describing Hang Out Your Poetry as a mildly psychedelic take on early 1990s pop, \"pleasant, accessible, well-produced ear-candy that's ultimately toothless\".[13]\nThe songs \"Could've Been Love\" and \"Ready for Love\" were released as singles from the album. Sonny and Cher also recorded backing vocals for the track \"Livin' It Up\" on the album.\n\n\nLGBT activism[edit]\n Bono at the 2012 GLAAD Awards\nIn April 1995, Bono came out as a lesbian in an interview with The Advocate, a national gay and lesbian magazine.[14] The 1998 book Family Outing detailed how Bono's coming out \"catapulted me into a political role that has transformed my life, providing me with affirmation as a lesbian, as a woman, and as an individual.\"[15] In the same book, Bono reported that Cher, who was both a gay icon and an ally of LGBT communities, was quite uncomfortable with the news at first and \"went ballistic\"[16] before coming to terms with it: \"By August 1996, one year after I came out publicly, my mother had progressed so far that she agreed to 'come out' herself on the cover of The Advocate as the proud mother of a lesbian daughter.\"[15] Cher has since become an outspoken LGBT rights activist.\nBono's paternal relationship became strained after Sonny became a Republican Congressman from California. The differences in their political views separated them, and the two had not spoken for more than a year at the time of Sonny's fatal skiing accident in January 1998.[14]\nBono worked as a writer at large for The Advocate.[4] As a social activist, Bono became a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, promoted National Coming Out Day, campaigned for the reelection of Bill Clinton for US President, campaigned against the Defense of Marriage Act, and served as Entertainment Media Director for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD).[4] Bono was a team captain for Celebrity Fit Club 3 (2006) and was supported by girlfriend Jennifer Elia, who orchestrated exercise and training sessions.[5]\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Bono and others told the stories of the people killed there.[17][18]\n\nTransition[edit]\nIn mid-2008, Bono began undergoing a physical and social transition from female to male. This was confirmed in June 2009 by his publicist,[5] who identified Bono's preferred name as Chaz Bono and said, \"It is Chaz's hope that his choice to transition will open the hearts and minds of the public regarding this issue, just as his coming out did.\"[19] GLAAD and the Empowering Spirits Foundation were quick to offer praise and support for the announcement.[20] Bono's legal transition was completed on May 6, 2010, when a California court granted his request for a gender and name change.[6][21] Bono made Becoming Chaz, a documentary film about his transition that premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. The Oprah Winfrey Network acquired the rights to the documentary and debuted it on May 10, 2011.[22]\nIn September 2011, he became a competitor on the 13th season of the US version of Dancing with the Stars, paired with professional ballroom dancer Lacey Schwimmer.[23] The duo was eliminated October 25, 2011.[24] This was the first time an openly transgender man starred on a major network television show for something unrelated to being transgender.[25]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\nNotes\n\n\n1994\n\nBar Girls[a]\n\nScorp'\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\nFronterz[a]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nDirty\n\nJerry the Hoarder\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n3 from Hell\n\nDigby Neville\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nDisclosure: Trans Lives on Screen\n\nHimself\n\nDocumentary film\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\nNotes\n\n\n1972\u201377\n\nThe Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour[a]\n\nHimself\n\n32 episodes\n\n\n1975\n\nCher[a]\n\nHimself\n\nEpisode 2.14\n\n\n1997\n\nEllen[a]\n\nThe Moderator\n\nEpisode: \"Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah\"\n\n\n2011\n\nBecoming Chaz\n\nHimself\n\nDocumentary film\n\n\nDancing with the Stars\n\nHimself\n\n6 episodes\n\n\n2012\n\nDegrassi: The Next Generation\n\nHimself\n\nEpisode: \"Tonight, Tonight: Part 2\"\n\n\n2013\n\nThe Secret Life of the American Teenager\n\nHimself\n\nEpisode: \"To Each Her Own\"\n\n\n2016\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nReverend Rydale\n\n5 episodes\n\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Roanoke\n\nLot Polk\n\n2 episodes\n\n\nBrian Wells\n\n2 episodes\n\n\nWhere the Bears Are\n\nGavin Kelly\n\n3 episodes\n\n\n2014\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\n\nHimself/Guest Judge\n\nTV Episode 609 \u201dQueens of Talk\u201d\n\n\n2017\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Cult\n\nGary K.

In 1986, Bornstein identified as gender non-conforming and has stated \"I don't call myself a woman, and I know I'm not a man\" after having been assigned male at birth and receiving sex reassignment surgery.[3]\nThey now identify with the pronouns they/them or she/her.[4] Bornstein has also written about having anorexia, being a survivor of PTSD and being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life\n1.2 Transition and post-op\n1.3 Cancer diagnosis\n\n\n2 Works\n\n2.1 Books\n2.2 Performance pieces\n\n\n3 References\n4 Further reading\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nEarly life[edit]\nBorn in Neptune City, New Jersey, into an upper middle-class Conservative Jewish family of Russian and Dutch descent,[6] Bornstein studied Theater Arts with John Emigh and Jim Barnhill at Brown University (Class of '69). She joined the Church of Scientology, becoming a high-ranking lieutenant in the Sea Org,[7][8][9] but later became disillusioned and formally left the movement in 1981. Bornstein's antagonism toward Scientology and public split from the church have had personal consequences; Bornstein's daughter, herself a Scientologist, no longer has any contact per Scientology's policy of disconnection.[10]\n\nTransition and post-op[edit]\nBornstein never felt comfortable with the belief of the day that all trans women are \"women trapped in men's bodies.\"[11] She did not identify as a man, but the only other option was to be a woman, a reflection of the gender binary, which required people to identify according to only two available genders. Another obstacle was the fact that Bornstein was attracted to women. She had sex reassignment surgery in 1986.\nBornstein settled into the lesbian community in San Francisco, and wrote art reviews for the gay and lesbian paper The Bay Area Reporter.[12] Over the next few years, she began to identify as neither a man nor a woman.[13] This catapulted Bornstein back to performing, creating several performance pieces, some of them one-person shows. It was the only way that she knew how to communicate life's paradoxes.\nBornstein also teaches workshops and has published several gender theory books and a novel. Hello Cruel World was written to keep \"teens, freaks, and other outlaws\" from dying by suicide. \"Do whatever it takes to make your life more worth living,\" Bornstein writes, \"just don't be mean.\"[14]\n\n Kate Bornstein at SUNY New Paltz in October, 2018. Photo by Morgan Gwenwald.\nBornstein's partner is Barbara Carrellas. They live in New York City with three cats, two dogs, and a turtle.[15]\n\nCancer diagnosis[edit]\nIn August 2012, Bornstein was diagnosed with lung cancer. Doctors thought that she was cancer-free after surgery, but it emerged in February 2013 that the disease had returned. Laura Vogel, a friend of hers, launched a GoFundMe campaign on March 20 to help fund the cancer treatment.[16]\n\nWorks[edit]\nIn 1989, Bornstein created a theatre production in collaboration with Noreen Barnes, Hidden: A Gender,  based on parallels between her own life and that of the intersex person Herculine Barbin.[17] In 2009, Bornstein's Hello, Cruel World: 101 Alternatives to Suicide for Teens, Freaks, and Other Outlaws was a Lambda Literary Award Finalist for LGBT Nonfiction and Honorbook for the Stonewall Children's and Young Adult Literature.[18] Bornstein edited Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation in collaboration with S. Bear Bergman.[19] The anthology won Lambda Literary and Publishing Triangle Awards in 2011.[20][21] Bornstein's autobiography, titled A Queer and Pleasant Danger: A Memoir, was released May 2012, and in April 2013, she released My New Gender Workbook: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving World Peace Through Gender Anarchy and Sex Positivity. Recently, Bornstein has taken part in a theatrical tour in England. She also took part in being a cast member in the reality TV show of I am Cait.[22]\n\nBooks[edit]\nBornstein, Kate (1994).

She worked as an entertainer, actress, model, Playboy bunny, professor of theater, and author. She also underwent one of the first sex reassignment surgery procedures performed in the United States.[2] Brevard lived her life outside of the wider transgender community and as a result, she was not publicly identified as transgender until publishing her memoirs in her later years.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 San Francisco and transition\n3 Education\n4 Attitude towards gender\n5 Later life\n6 Works\n7 Film and television\n8 Theater\n9 See also\n10 Sources\n11 References\n12 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBrevard was born in Erwin, Tennessee, on December 9, 1937.[3][4] Growing up in a religious family in a rural part of central Tennessee,[1][5] she was always close to her mother. Brevard always felt different than other children, like a girl inside, and prayed nightly to wake up a girl.[6][7] Brevard's teen years were awkward, and after a romantic disappointment in high school, Brevard left right after graduation to the West Coast.[6]\n\nSan Francisco and transition[edit]\nEnding up in San Francisco, Brevard found a job as a female impersonator at Finocchio's Club in San Francisco under the stage name Lee Shaw in the early 1960s,[8] doing Marilyn Monroe impressions,[2][4] eventually achieving enough renown that Marilyn herself came to a performance.[9]\nBrevard began her transition at 21 under the care of famed gender specialist Harry Benjamin in the late 1950s. At Benjamin's recommendation, Brevard underwent the surgical reassignment procedure in Los Angeles's Westlake Clinic under the care of surgeon Elmer Belt.[6]\nBrevard later worked as a stripper in Reno and as a Playboy bunny.[2]\n\nEducation[edit]\nAfter a year's recovery post-surgery,[6] she enrolled as a student at Middle Tennessee State University for her undergraduate education[10][non-primary source needed]. During this period, she became more comfortable with her womanhood, got married, and took classes.[6] This was at a time when she was a working actress, touring the U.S. doing theater, and working in film or television. She gained membership in Hollywood unions,[10][non-primary source needed] and ultimately got her master's degree in Theater from Middle Tennessee State.[7]\nThrough Dr. Harry Benjamin, Brevard became friends in the late 1950s and 1960s with other transgender patients of his, including Charlotte Frances McLeod and Kathy Taylor, and they became a support network for each other. Together they had lunches with Dr. Benjamin who they also considered to be a paternal kind of mentor and friend.\n\nAttitude towards gender[edit]\nBrevard's was one of the first medical transitions, and occurred before the term transgender had been coined and before there was a transgender community in San Francisco.[1][11]\nBrevard did not identify as trans early in her life and would deflect questions.[12] Her husbands were not aware that she had transitioned.[1] However she decided to change because she realized she was denying her own personal history.[12] Once her memoir came out in 2001, she started to become labeled a \"transsexual writer\" and \"transsexual actress\". As she stated in her second book, \"I'd been labeled\u2014forced into a transsexual mold.\"[11]\n\"Professionally, both as a film/stage actress and, later, as a university professor of theatre, my life was lived outside the gender community. Only after publishing two memoirs, when in my 60s and 70s, did I first hear the term 'transgender' and become aware of the community's stated agenda,\" she said in an interview in 2013.[6] She also said in April 2017 \"I did not go through gender reassignment to be labeled transsexual. I look at that as an awkward phase that I went through\u2014sort of like a really painful adolescence. I don't even think of myself now in terms as transsexual. That's something I experienced and [something] I was\".[3]\n\"For me, as well as for my early sisters, the goal was never to live with a 't' before our names. Our objective was to blend so thoroughly that the things mixed could not be recognized. It was a choice, made not because we felt any shame about our transsexual history, but because our goal had always been to live fully as the women we\u2019d been born to be.\"[6]\nIn the book, \"Bodies in the Making: Transgressions and Transformations\" (2006) by Nancy N. Chen, Brevard is interviewed by Mary Weaver discussing topics like gender, gender reassignment, the importance of personal history, and personal transformation.[12]\n\nLater life[edit]\nAfter her work in television and film, she returned to Tennessee and received her M.A. in Theater Arts from Middle Tennessee State University.[7] She met her first husband in Tennessee and had other marriages, which according to her sister, did not work out.[citation needed] She returned to California in the late 1990s, settling outside of Santa Cruz with an old friend, finding work as a substitute teacher, and doing some community theater.\nAleshia Brevard died at home in Scotts Valley, California, on July 1, 2017, at the age of 79.[1]\n\nWorks[edit]\nBrevard, Aleshia (15 February 2001).

Browne was assigned female at birth and played in women's competitions during his ice hockey career; he came out as a transgender man in 2016 and was the first openly transgender athlete in a professional team sport during his career.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Playing career\n\n1.1 Hockey Canada\n1.2 Collegiate\n1.3 Professional\n\n\n2 Post-retirement\n3 Career statistics\n\n3.1 Regular season and playoffs\n\n\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nPlaying career[edit]\nHockey Canada[edit]\nBrowne played for Team Canada at the 2011 IIHF World Women's U18 Championship, appearing in the gold medal game.[2] Among his teammates on Team Canada included future Mercyhurst and Beauts teammates Shelby Bram and Amanda Makela. Browne was also a member of the Ontario provincial team that gained the silver medal at the 2011 Canada Winter Games.[3]\n\nCollegiate[edit]\nBrowne played one season for the Mercyhurst Lakers before transferring to the University of Maine, playing his remaining collegiate years with the Black Bears.[4] Browne's NCAA debut took place on September 30, 2011 with the Mercyhurst Lakers in a contest against the Quinnipiac Bobcats. He waited until October 29, 2011 for his first career NCAA goal, scoring against conference rival Lindenwood in a road contest.\nBrowne's debut with Maine took place against Quinnipiac, with the match held on October 12, 2012. His first goal with Maine also took place on January 19, 2013 against the Vermont Catamounts. The last goal of his NCAA career occurred on February 21, 2015 against the Connecticut Huskies.\n\nProfessional[edit]\nBrowne signed a professional contract with the Buffalo Beauts of the newly formed NWHL on August 29, 2015.[4] In the 2015\u201316 season, he played in 18 games, scored 5 goals and had 12 points. He played in 5 games in the NWHL postseason, scoring 2 goals and 2 assists.[5]\nOn May 14, 2016, Browne signed a second one-year contract with the Beauts.[6]\nIn October 2016, Browne came out as a transgender man and thus became the first openly transgender athlete in professional American hockey. Browne will not hormonally transition until the end of his professional playing career, as the hormones involved in female-to-male gender transition violate anti-doping regulations.[7]\nPlaying for Team Kessel, Browne scored two goals at the 2nd NWHL All-Star Game.[8]\nOn March 14, 2017, Browne announced he would be retiring from the NWHL at the end of the season to begin hormone replacement therapy and continue his gender transition in privacy.[9]\nOn March 19, 2017 Browne won the Isobel Cup with the Buffalo Beauts, becoming the first openly transgender athlete to win a national championship on a team sport.\nOn August 7, 2017 he announced he would be putting his retirement on hold and would instead return for the 2017\u201318 season with the Metropolitan Riveters.[10]\nOn April 25, 2018 Browne won the Isobel Cup for the second time, this time with the Metropolitan Riveters (the team's first win).\nOn April 30, 2018 Browne again announced his retirement from the NWHL.[11]\n\nPost-retirement[edit]\nSince his retirement from the NWHL, Browne has primarily devoted his time to speaking engagements across North America. He has given talks and spoken on panels at colleges, such as Ohio State University, American University, and Fleming College as well as LGBTQ events, such as Outsports Pride.[12]\nIn August 2019, Browne announced on his personal twitter that he was beginning a new career as an actor.[13] He emphasized that he plans to advocate for more transgender visibility in his new venture as he had in his athletic career.\n\nCareer statistics[edit]\nRegular season and playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular season\n\n\n\nPlayoffs\n\n\nSeason\n\nTeam\n\nLeague\n\nGP\n\nG\n\nA\n\nPts\n\nPIM\n\nGP\n\nG\n\nA\n\nPts\n\nPIM\n\n\n2011\u201312\n\nMercyhurst Lakers\n\nCHA\n\n32\n\n3\n\n2\n\n5\n\n12\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\n2012\u201313\n\nMaine Black Bears\n\nHE\n\n33\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n38\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2013\u201314\n\nMaine Black Bears\n\nHE\n\n30\n\n3\n\n7\n\n10\n\n49\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n2014\u201315\n\nMaine Black Bears\n\nHE\n\n33\n\n7\n\n10\n\n17\n\n34\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\n2015\u201316\n\nBuffalo Beauts\n\nNWHL\n\n18\n\n5\n\n7\n\n12\n\n26\n\n5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\n\n\n2016\u201317\n\nBuffalo Beauts\n\nNWHL\n\n17\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n22\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\n2017\u201318\n\nMetropolitan Riveters\n\nNWHL\n\n16\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n8\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Pruski, Scout (November 28, 2018). \"Harrison Browne talks Ovi, activism in visit to American University\".

In 2012, Bullens publicly came out as a transgender man and changed his name to Cidny Bullens.[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Personal life\n3 Discography\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nBullens released two albums in the late 1970s on United Artists and Casablanca and another in 1989.[3]\nBullens\u2019 1978 debut album, Desire Wire is described flatly by William Ruhlmann for AllMusic as: \"One of the great lost rock albums of the 1970s, Bullens' debut release is full of tough, passionate, incredibly catchy rock & roll played to the hilt and sung with fire\".[4] These early albums anticipated later work by a host of 1980s female and female-identified rock artists, from Pat Benatar, to Blondie, to the Go-Go's, to Headpins.\nIn 1974, Bullens performed background vocals on Gene Clark's album No Other and as one of the Sex-O-Lettes on the debut album by Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes. Also on Don Everly's solo album Sunset Towers, Bryan Adams'You Want It, You Got It and many others.\nBullens also served as a backup vocalist on Rod Stewart's Atlantic Crossing and with Elton John on three major tours, as well as his album Blue Moves and his hit with Kiki Dee, \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" (both released in 1976).\nBullens provided vocals on three songs (\"It's Raining on Prom Night,\" \"Mooning,\" and \"Freddy, My Love\") on the soundtrack of the 1978 feature film, Grease. The album release Grease was nominated for the 1979 Grammy Award for \"Album of the Year\".\nIn 1980, Bullens earned another Grammy nomination (as \"best female rock singer\") for his single \"Survivor\".\nIn January 1980, Bullens hit the Billboard Hot 100 with the song \"Trust Me.\" It peaked at No. 90.[5] He withdrew from the music business in the early 1980s to raise a family, returning in the early and mid-1990s as a songwriter and then later as a touring and recording artist. Since 1999, Bullens has toured extensively all over the US, Canada, Europe and Australia, has appeared on several major TV shows, including Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Today Show, and CBS This Morning and many radio and TV stations around the world. He is featured in two documentaries, On This Island and Space Between Breaths (and scored the music).  Bullens wrote the music and lyrics for the musical Islands in 2000, which played on Broadway for a special performance at the New Victory Theater in September 2001, two weeks after 9/11.\nIn 1999, Bullens' album Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth (Artemis Records) was recorded in the first two years after the death of his daughter Jessie. It features Bonnie Raitt, Lucinda Williams, Rodney Crowell, Beth Nielsen Chapman, Bryan Adams, and top-tier musicians including George Marinelli, Benmont Tench, Kenny Edwards, and Michael Rhodes. Steven Soles co-produced one track, Tony Berg co-produced three tracks, and Rodney Crowell co-produced three tracks. It won the AFIM Best Rock Album in 2000 and was widely acclaimed.[by whom?]\nIn 2001, Bullens released Neverland; co-produced with Ray Kennedy, the album features Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle, and John Hiatt. In 2005, he released dream #2 again co-produced with Ray Kennedy. The title track features Elton John on piano.  Delbert McClinton sings a duet with Bullens on \"This Ain't Love\" and Boston Red Sox knuckleballer Tim Wakefield adds his voice to \"7 Days\".\nIn 2007, Bullens formed a new group, The Refugees, with music veterans Wendy Waldman and Deborah Holland. Their first CD, Unbound, was released in January 2009. Their second album \"Three\" was released in February 2012.[6]\nIn June 2010, Bullens' released Howling Trains and Barking Dogs on MC Records (Koch). The CD is a compilation of songs he co-wrote in Nashville during the early and mid-1990s with Radney Foster, Bill Lloyd, Al Anderson, Matraca Berg, Mary Ann Kennedy Kye Fleming, and Jimmy Tittle. The CD also includes two new songs written by him alone.[citation needed]\nIn August 2020, Bullens released his first album as \"Cidny\"--Walkin' Through This World\", co-produced by Bullens and Ray Kennedy (Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Rodney Crowell). This new album is loosely themed around Cidny's transition, featuring the provocative first single \"The Gender Line\".\nCid is also the subject of the award-winning documentary short \"The Gender Line\" (directed by TJ Parsell and produced by Bill Brimm), which played in many film festivals world-wide in 2019\u201320.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBullens grew up in Massachusetts. In 1979, Bullens married Dan Crewe, brother of songwriter/producer Bob Crewe, and divorced in 2002. Their daughter Reid was born in 1982. Their younger daughter, Jessie, born in 1985, died at age 11, of complications during treatment for cancer in 1996.\nAs an artistic outlet for coming out as transgender, in February 2016, Bullens debuted a \"one wo/man show\" entitled Somewhere Between \u2013 Not an Ordinary Life. Nashville Scene voted it to be the \"Best One-Person Show of 2016.\"[7]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSinger solo\n\nDesire Wire  (United Artists Records, 1979) \u2013 LP and cassette.\nSteal the Night (Casablanca Records, 1979) \u2013 LP and cassette.\nCindy Bullens  (MCA Records, 1989) \u2013 LP, cassette and CD.\nWhy Not?

Later that summer they appeared at the Great South Bay and Port Jefferson Music Festivals.[citation needed] In January 2012, Byrne was the co-director for the Beatles Complete on Ukulele Festival at Brooklyn Bowl, alongside festival founder, producer Roger Greenawalt, and another performance that March at South By Southwest.[10] In 2012 Byrne became endorsed by D'Addario Strings.[11] In February of that year, Byrne suffered a vocal hemorrhage.[12]\nBy August she had recovered enough to begin touring again behind her first solo acoustic record, Lucky, and subsequently appeared as a feature artist on John Platt's show on WFUV.[13] The album reached No. 31 on the Roots Music Report charts for NY-based artists by January 2013.[citation needed]\nIn 2014, Byrne was named by New Jersey alternative music newspaper The Aquarian Weekly' as one of the 30 most promising acts of 2014[14] and was chosen to compete in the WNYC \"Battle of the Boroughs\",[15] and to perform as a showcase artist at the prestigious Northeast Regional Folk Alliance conference.[16]\nLater in 2014, after she announced her transition on her blog,[4] Byrne gave interviews to Sing Out! and WFDU-FM radio,[12] and her poetry was featured in The Advocate.[17] In the summer of 2014, she performed at Rockwood Music Hall, the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and Montclair CenterStage.[18]\nSince 2014, Byrne has written several op-eds for The Advocate and Huffington Post on trans lives.[19][20][21][22] She is currently a staff writer for Country Queer magazine [23]\nIn 2015, Byrne was named an Emerging Artist at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, performing on the mainstage, and released her first solo full-length album, \"As I Am.\" She was the first-place Americana winner in the 2015 Great American Song Contest, and appeared at the 2016 Philadelphia Folk Festival and again at Falcon Ridge. In 2016 her short story \"Chain of Rocks\" was published in The James Franco Review, selected by guest editor Ryka Aoki.[24] In 2017 she performed at the San Francisco Trans March, and in early 2018, the Ms. San Francisco Leather contest. \nHer music was also featured in \"[Trans]formation\", a new play on trans identity, in collaboration with The Living Canvas in Chicago.[25]\nIn addition to performing solo, Byrne plays bass and writes songs for The Homobiles, a San Francisco-based queercore band fronted by Lynn Breedlove (formerly of Tribe 8), and Lavender Country, founded in 1973 and recognised by the Country Music Hall of Fame as the world's first openly gay country music band. \nIn June 2019 Byrne headlined Berkeley Pride, and performed solo on the main stage of the San Francisco Dyke March.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Mya Byrne On WFDU FM's TRADITIONS \u2013 June 16, 2014 by WFDU-Ron Olesko | Free Listening on SoundCloud\".

His writings explore sexuality and gender identity, and have included lesbian erotica and works about BDSM subculture.[4] Califia is a member of the third-wave feminism movement.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Education\n3 Career\n4 Personal life\n\n4.1 Transition\n\n\n5 Selected bibliography\n\n5.1 Non-fiction\n5.2 Fiction\n\n\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nThis article may be confusing or unclear to readers. Please help us clarify the article. There might be a discussion about this on the talk page. (February 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nCalifia was born in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1954, as a female. He grew up in Utah in a Latter-day Saint family,[2] the eldest of six children.[5][6] His father was a construction worker and his mother a housewife. Califia has said he did not have a good childhood, claiming that his father was an angry and violent man and his mother a pious woman.[7]\nCalifia believed in the Mormon religion, incorporating elements of Mormonism in his approach to life.[7] One primary tenet of Mormonism he tended to follow was, \"if the truth has been revealed to you and you don't speak out, you are culpable for any wrongs that are committed in those realms of life.\"[7] A sense of difference began when he was a child. He had dreams of becoming a train engineer, which his parents shot down because he was born female.[7] He started transitioning in 1999.[2]\nIn the 1970s, Califia's parents had him admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and he dropped out of the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, due to his mental state. Califia came out as a lesbian in 1971 while attending college.[4] He began using the last name Califia,[citation needed] after the mythical female warrior Amazon.[8] Califia began to evade his parents, and became involved in the women's liberation and anti-war movements.[7] After getting involved in consciousness raising in the area, he moved to San Francisco in 1973, bringing an interest in sex education to work on the San Francisco Sex Information switchboard.[9] After moving to San Francisco he began writing for a magazine and joined a lesbian separatist movement. In 1975 he spoke in favor of sadomasochism and found himself excluded from the lesbian feminist community.[7] He was not only excluded from his nuclear family by coming out as a lesbian but also lost his gay family when speaking his opinions.[7] Califia became increasingly involved in S/M activities not only with lesbians but also with gay men. He co-founded the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States, Samois, in 1978.[7][10][11][12]\n\nEducation[edit]\nCalifia began attending the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in 1971.[5] In 1981, he graduated from San Francisco State University (SFSU) with a bachelor of arts degree in psychology.[1][13] He has also said he has a master's degree.[14]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 1980, Califia published his first book\u2014Sapphistry: The Book of Lesbian Sexuality, a non-fiction work for lesbians which described, in a non-judgmental tone, butch-femme sexuality, and BDSM safety and practice.[15] Subsequently, he published work in lesbian, gay and feminist magazines, including a long-running sex advice column in The Advocate.[16]\nCalifia is \"one of [the] earliest champions of lesbian sadomasochistic sex\" whose \"work has been taught on college campuses across the country and abroad.\"[2] He has a long history of transgression, identifying as a feminist, lesbian, and transgender while also at times finding rejection from those communities \"for various infractions.\"[2] He played what some observers termed a \"notable role\" in the Feminist Sex Wars of the 1970s/1980s.[2] The sides were characterized by anti-porn feminist and sex-positive feminist groups with disagreements regarding sexuality, pornography and other forms of sexual representation, prostitution, the role of trans women in the lesbian community, lesbian sexual practices, sadomasochism, and other sexual issues. Califia rejected the \"essentialist, feminist ideology\u2014that women are better, more nurturing, more peaceful, more loving, more relationship-oriented and less raunchy in bed,\" instead advocating for BDSM, \"the consensual integration of power, pain, domination and submission into sex.\"[2] According to the San Francisco Chronicle, many feminists were won over to Califia's views on S/M not from his arguments, but from his erotic fiction: \"they read Califia-Rice's S/M fantasies, got turned on and got over it.\"[2]\nIn 1979, as a student in psychology at San Francisco State University, his research was published in the Journal of Homosexuality.[17]\nCalifia co-founded Samois, a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization based in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983, and shifted his focus to the lesbian experience of BDSM.[18] The Samois Collective produced, with Califia's contributions, the book Coming to Power, published by Alyson Publications.[2][19] Coming To Power, according to Heather Findlay, editor-in-chief of lesbian magazine Girlfriends, was \"one of the most transformative lesbian books, [foretelling] the end of a certain puritanism that had dominated the community. It was the first articulate defense of lesbian S/M, and that was the end of it.\"[2] Another book, the Lesbian S/M Safety Manual, won the 1990 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year.[20]\nIn 1989, Califia and Geoff Mains received the Steve Maidhof Award for National or International Work from the National Leather Association International.[21]\nIn 1992, Califia founded the leatherwomen's quarterly Venus Infers and published \"Feminism, Paedophilia, and Children's Rights\" in a special women's issue of the pro-pedophile scholarly journal Paidika. Califia has asserted that he 'support[s] Paidika and enjoyed working with the editors of this special issue'.[22] Califia has criticised federal laws against child abuse imagery because it would have 'guaranteed that it [child abuse imagery] would disappear from the shelves of adult book stores'.[23] In 'Public Sex: The Culture of Radical Sex', Califia criticised anti child abuse / anti child pornography laws because they are applied disproportionately to gay men, commenting that he 'knew several gay men who proudly called themselves boy-lovers'.[23] Califia has asserted that all age of consent laws should be repealed,[23] describing pedophilia as 'erotic initiation'.[23] After becoming a parent, Califia reconsidered his stance on the age of consent and adult / child sex: 'I was naive about the developmental issues that make sex between adults and prepubescent children unacceptable,'; 'I've become much more cynical about the ability of adults to listen to children'; 'Perhaps because I am a parent now, I am less idealistic about the possibilities for an equal adult / child relationship,'.[23]\nIn 1996 he was co-editor, with Robin Sweeney, of The Second Coming: A Leatherdyke Reader, a sequel to Coming to Power.[19] Califia was writing about queer studies and gender identity, and coming to terms with these issues on a personal level. At age 45, Califia transitioned, taking the name Patrick.[24]\nIn a 2000 interview, Califia explained that the inspiration for his erotic writings varies; sometimes it is just about having fun, or it can be satire, or exploring a sexuality issue like HIV-positive people barebacking with the intention of infecting the other person with the virus.[2] In the interview with Rona Marech, Califia is quoted as saying:\n\nIt's about me trying to put a human face on that and understand that from the inside out. ...It's about being thought-provoking, hopefully. And I like (presenting issues) that challenge the reader; that are maybe a little scary, maybe hard to think about. ...It's also a way to top a lot of people. In some ways, I get to do a scene with everyone who reads one [sic] my books.[2]\nJanet Hardy, of Greenery Press, admires Califia's tenacity, stating, \"He's got a phenomenal mind.... He's willing to get a hold of a thought and follow it through to the end, even if it doesn't feel comfortable.\"[2]\nCalifia was nominated for the Lambda Literary Awards for his short-story collection, Macho Sluts (1988), his novel, Doc and Fluff: The Dystopian Tale of a Girl and Her Biker (1990), and a compilation of his columns, The Advocate Adviser (1991).[7]  He is working on a book that discusses the topic of FTM sexuality,[when?] and is working on a new set of essays surrounding the topic of BDSM.[when?] He has also written vampire books.[25]\nCalifia presented a paper for the American Academy of Religion conference in Montr\u00e9al, November 19\u201322, 2009,[26] on the gay marriage debate, and how arguments about monogamy and S/M have been used to try and control the argument.\nWhen Califia would travel to Canada, his pornographic works were often seized by Canadian customs, until he fought a court case to allow them to be accepted.[27] Afterwards, he wrote of his amusement at finding that anti-porn feminist Catherine Itzin's book, Pornography: Women, Violence and Civil Liberties, was seized under the very law she had helped to establish, while Califia's books were recognized as acceptable by that law. Califia fought against anti-pornography legislation co-authored by Catharine MacKinnon.[2]\nIn 2013, he was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the LGBT History Month.[28]\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Califia was licensed in California as a marriage and family therapist (MFT).[29]\nCalifia is an inductee of the Society of Janus Hall of Fame.[30]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nCalifia has a son, Blake Califia-Rice (born October 1999), to whom his ex-partner, Matt Rice (now a trans man), gave birth.[31]\nCalifia has said that, since the 1990s, he has had fibromyalgia.[32]\n\nTransition[edit]\nIn 1999, Califia decided to begin hormone replacement therapy as a part of his transition.[7] Califia had considered sex reassignment in his twenties, but had been hesitant, for one reason, because there were many dangers to the surgery at that time.[7] He also hesitated because his career had been built around a reputation as a lesbian writer and activist. Califia had entered age-related perimenopause when he began his transition.[7] He has stated that being a man or a woman was never a good fit for him but sex reassignment seemed to be the most reasonable option.[7]\n\nSelected bibliography[edit]\nNon-fiction[edit]\nSapphistry: The Book of Lesbian Sexuality (1980) (ISBN\u00a0978-0-93-004414-5)\nPublic Sex: The Culture of Radical Sex (1994) (ISBN\u00a0978-0-93-941689-9)\nFeminism and Sadomasochism, a chapter/article in Feminism and Sexuality: A Reader (1996) (edited by Stevi Jackson and Sue Scott) (ISBN\u00a0978-0-23-110708-2)\nSex Changes: The Politics of Transgenderism (1997) (ISBN\u00a0978-1-57-344072-1)\nSpeaking Sex to Power: The Politics of Queer Sex (2001) (ISBN\u00a0978-1-57-344132-2)\nFiction[edit]\nMacho Sluts: Erotic Fiction (July 1994) (ISBN\u00a0978-1-55-583115-8)\n(as editor) Doing It for Daddy: Short and Sexy Fiction about a Very Forbidden Fantasy (December 1994) (ISBN\u00a0978-1-55-583227-8)\nDoc and Fluff: The Dystopian Tale of a Girl and Her Biker (May 2000) (ISBN\u00a0978-1-55-583369-5)\nNo Mercy: Short Stories (June 2000) (ISBN\u00a0978-1-55-583542-2)\nMelting Point (November 2000) (ISBN\u00a0978-1-55-583380-0)\nSee also[edit]\nCatacombs (sex club)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Patrick Califia\". nndb.com.

This title's reference to the earlier volume is obvious. But it also strikes me that the theological connotation it carries of a \"resurrection\" is a concept that is deeply inscribed in s/m practice. Such a \"redemptive\" grammar, which is pervasive in the literature, could be perceived as pastoralizing in tone, and indeed must be in part. But it also campy and ironic, parodic in one sense and, like all parody carrying with it a certain ambivalent reverence for the model that it both mocks and imitates.\n\n^ Burkardt, John (June 1, 2007). \"The Oddest Book Titles\". people.scs.fsu.edu.

He moved to rural Arkansas in 1969 after his mother's death, where he lived as a self-described tomboy on his father's farm.[citation needed] By the age of 16, Cameron identified as a lesbian and encountered homophobic hostility in the small town where he lived.[2] At this time, Cameron quit school and left his home to travel the country seeking work as a construction laborer and other blue collar employment.[citation needed] In 1979, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he identified socially with the lesbian community until the age of 26, when he confronted his dissatisfaction his body and was excluded from the lesbian community.[3][4] Cameron's interest in photography coincided with the beginning of his physical changes as he documented his own physiological transition from female to male at this time. Despite his lack of formal training, beginning in 1993 Cameron studied the rudiments of photography and began to photograph the transsexual community.[2] Since 1994, he has given lectures on his work at universities, educational conferences and art institutes. By 1995, Cameron's photographs had been shown in solo exhibitions in San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles.[2]\n\nCareer[edit]\nThis section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources.

His first published works (Body Alchemy: Transsexual Portraits and Man Tool: The Nuts and Bolts of Female-to-Male Surgery) consist largely of self-portraits, and portraits of other female to male transsexuals.[1] Body Alchemy documented Cameron's personal experience of transition from female to male, his life as a man, and the everyday lives of trans men he knew.[2] The nude figures' poses in the artist's photography often portray moments of action and performance.[5] In many of his self portraits, he includes the shutter-release bulb that he used to take the photograph. The choice to work alone and feature the bulb serves as a commentary on the self-made aspect of being transsexual.[6] His photography shows how the issues of queer bioethics come up not only in clinical sites but also in public art and museum spaces. His work was intended to remove the clinical view of transsexual bodies and redefine them as not in need of a cure.[5] Body Alchemy became a double 1996 Lambda Literary Award winner.[7] It remains his most well-known work to date, though he has since published other photographic works. More recently published work includes representation of both female and male transsexuals, portraits and classical nudes (Body Photographs by Loren Cameron Volume 1 and 2.[1]\nCameron's work was first shown as part of a 1994 exhibit in San Francisco.[5] His images have also been exhibited in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, in Santiago, Chile, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and in Mexico City, Mexico.[citation needed] They have been published in numerous books such as Transgender Warriors (Leslie Feinberg, 1996) and Constructing Masculinity: Discussions in Contemporary Culture (Routledge, 1995).[citation needed] He has also posed for photographers such as Daniel Nicoletta, Amy Arbus, and Howard Shatz.[citation needed] The LGBTQ+ community has been the most supportive of the artist's photography.[5] Highlighting the work in their community centers and print media.[5] Cameron lectures throughout the United States at universities and other venues, including Smith College, Harvard, Cornell, Brown, the University of California at Berkeley, Penn State, and at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.[citation needed] In May 2008, Cameron presented his work at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. On television, he has been profiled on the Discovery Health Channel's LGBT-themed one-hour special Sex Change: Him to Her, on the National Geographic Channel's \"Taboo\" Sexual Identity\" series.[8] He has also been interviewed in the magazine, The New Yorker.[4]\n\nImpact[edit]\nCameron's work is controversial among critics. Many praise his photographs as compelling and informative,[3][9] while others criticize it for being sexually explicit.[10]\nIn 2012, The University of Minnesota-Duluth invited Loren Cameron to campus to present his photography.[10][11][12] The University paid Cameron $4,000 from student services [12] to cover his speaker\u2019s fee and travel expenses.[10][11] This decision was met with backlash, due to him and his subjects' identity as transsexual individuals, as well as the nudity in Cameron\u2019s work.[10][11] Despite the objections, Cameron delivered his presentation on September 26, 2012.[12]\nBody Alchemy is considered by some to be influential for bringing attention to the social and medical issues that transsexual people face.\n\nWorks[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nBody Alchemy: Transsexual Portraits. 1996, Cleis Press.

Drummer Sal Abruscato was recruited soon afterwards. After signing with Roadrunner Records, they debuted with the 1993 album, River Runs Red. Shortly after the release of a third album in 1997, Caputo claimed that her heart was no longer in the type of music they performed, and left the group. After leaving the group, Caputo formed Absolute Bloom. However, the band broke up in July 1998.\nCaputo also guested on the track \"Free Speech (Will Cost You)\", which appears on the album Memory Rendered Visible by the band Both Worlds, released on Roadrunner Records.\nCaputo also worked extensively on a solo career in the 1990s, and released two studio albums. Later, she helped to re-form the Brazilian band Freax, which had broken up over ten years earlier. They developed a self-titled album in 2003.\nThe original line-up of Life of Agony reunited for two sold-out shows at New York's Irving Plaza on January 3 and 4, 2003. The reunion resulted in several more shows and appearances on European festivals, as well as the recording of Broken Valley (2005), the band's first new material since 1997.\nIn 2003, Caputo formed a group consisting of New York musicians Mike Shaw (Bass) and Dan Platt (guitars), along with Dutch musicians Jochem Van Rooijen (drums) and Jack Pisters (lead guitars) that toured and recorded what became the album Live Monsters (2004).\nIn 2005, Caputo provided vocals for the song \"Tired N' Lonely\" on the Roadrunner United: The All-Star Sessions album.\nOn May 1, 2006, Caputo released her third solo album Hearts Blood on Your Dawn which was only sold at her live shows, via mailorder through her website, and in the iTunes Store.\nIn 2007, Caputo recorded her fourth solo album, A Fondness for Hometown Scars, which includes a guest appearance by Flea (of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) on trumpet, amongst others. In 2008, she toured in support of this release, with a band composed of Dutch musicians Ryan Oldcastle (guitars), Axel van Oort (bass), and Jochem van Rooijen (drums). The album was produced by Martyn LeNoble and was released in Europe in April 2008 by Dutch label, Suburban Records.\nCaputo participated as a guest singer on Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation's track \"What Have You Done\", the first single (and second track) from their 2007 album The Heart of Everything.\nIn 2011, Caputo formed a side project with Ryan Oldcastle and Michael Shaw called The Neptune Darlings, and released an album on September 15, 2011 called Chestnuts & Fireflies.[1] The style of this CD has been called \"geek rock\" by The Advocate magazine.[1]\nIn 2014, Life of Agony re-formed with Caputo singing, releasing the album A Place Where There Is No More Pain in 2017, and The Sound of Scars in 2019 with Veronica Bellino replacing longtime drummer Sal Abruscato.[4]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n Caputo in 2009\nIn July 2011, Caputo came out as transgender.[1][3][5] For a while, her legal name was Keith Mina Caputo.[6][1] \"When I was Keith, I certainly wouldn't allow myself to be as flowery or as vulnerable as I do now,\" said Caputo in a 2016 interview that appeared on the music website No Echo. \"I'm a fucking sissy, get over it [laughs]! I no longer have this masculinity or this manhood to protect.

Born and raised in Rhode Island, Carlos studied physics and music at Brown University before moving to New York City in 1962 to study music composition at Columbia University. Studying and working with various electronic musicians and technicians at the city's Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, she helped in the development of the Moog synthesizer, the first commercially available keyboard instrument created by Robert Moog.\nCarlos came to prominence with Switched-On Bach (1968), an album of music by Johann Sebastian Bach performed on a Moog synthesizer, which helped popularize its use in the 1970s and won her three Grammy Awards.[1] Its commercial success led to several more albums, including further synthesized classical music adaptations, and experimental and ambient music. She composed the score to two Stanley Kubrick films \u2013 A Clockwork Orange (1971) and The Shining (1980) \u2013 and also Tron (1982) for Walt Disney Productions.\nIn 1979, Carlos raised public awareness of transgender issues by disclosing she had been living as a woman since at least 1968, and in 1972 had undergone sex reassignment surgery.[2][3][4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 1960s\n2.2 1970s\n2.3 1980s\n2.4 1990s\u20132000s\n\n\n3 Personal life\n\n3.1 Gender transition\n3.2 Lawsuit\n3.3 Biography\n\n\n4 Awards and honors\n5 Other\n6 Discography\n\n6.1 Studio albums\n6.2 Soundtracks\n6.3 Compilations\n6.4 Appears on\n\n\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 Further reading\n10 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nCarlos was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the first of two children born to working-class parents.[5] Her mother played the piano and sang and had an uncle who played the trombone and another who played the trumpet and drums.[5] She began piano lessons at six years of age,[6] and wrote her first composition, \"A Trio for Clarinet, Accordion, and Piano,\" at 10.[7] Carlos attended St. Raphael Academy, a Catholic high school in Pawtucket. In 1953, at fourteen, Carlos won a scholarship for building a computer presented at the Westinghouse Science Fair, a science competition for high-school students.[8] From 1958 to 1962, Carlos studied at Brown University and graduated with a degree in music and physics, during which she taught lessons in electronic music at informal sessions.[9]\nIn 1965, Carlos graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in music composition, and assisted Leonard Bernstein in presenting an evening of electronic music at the Philharmonic Hall.[9] Carlos studied with Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening, two pioneers of electronic music in the 1960s; they were based in the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City, the first of its kind in the United States. After Ussachevsky suggested to Carlos that she work in a recording studio to support herself, Carlos began working as a recording and mastering engineer at Gotham Recording Studios in New York City; she worked in this position until 1968.[5][9][10] She called it \"a really lovely occupation\" and found it a useful learning experience.[10]\nDuring her time at Columbia, Carlos met Robert Moog at the annual Audio Engineering Society show,[11] which began a partnership; Carlos gave advice and technical assistance in the development of the Moog synthesizer, Moog's new electronic keyboard instrument, convincing Moog to add a touch-sensitive device for greater musical dynamics, among other improvements.[12] By 1966, Carlos owned a small Moog synthesizer, which she used to record sound effects and jingles for television commercials, which earned her \"anywhere from $100 to $1000.\u201d[5] In 1967, Carlos befriended Rachel Elkind, a former singer[5] who had a musical theatre background and worked as a secretary for Goddard Lieberson, then-president of Columbia Records. The two shared a home, studio, and business premises in a brownstone building in the West Side of Manhattan in New York City.[13]\nCarlos recorded several compositions in the 1960s as a student at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Two of them were re-recorded and released on By Request (1975), Dialogues for Piano and Two Loudspeakers (1963) and Episodes for Piano and Electronic Sound (1964), both featuring Phillip Ramey on piano. A third, Variations for Flute and Electronic Sounds (1964, featuring John Heiss on flute) was recorded and released in 1965 on a Turnabout Records \"Electronic Music\" compilation.  Other known, but unreleased student compositions include \"Episodes for Piano and Tape\" (1964), \"Pomposities for Narrator and Tape\" (1965), and \"Noah\" (1965), a two-hour opera blending electronics with an orchestra. Carlos' first commercial release was Moog 900 Series\u00a0\u2013 Electronic Music Systems (1967), an introduction to the technical aspects of the Moog synthesizer released as a nine-minute single-sided mono LP and narrated by Ed Stokes.[14] Part of her compensation for making the recording was in Moog equipment.[11]\n\nCareer[edit]\n1960s[edit]\nCarlos's music career began with Switched-On Bach, an album formed of several pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach performed on a Moog modular synthesizer. The idea came about around 1967, when Carlos asked Elkind to listen to some recordings by Carlos and musicologist Benjamin Folkman made up to ten years prior at the Electronic Music Center, one of them being Bach's Two-Part Invention in F major, which Elkind took a liking to. Plans for an album of several Bach compositions developed from there, leading to a recording contract with Columbia Masterworks through Elkind's contacts, a deal that lasted until 1986. The label had launched an album sales campaign named \"Bach to Rock,\u201d though it had no album of Bach's works in a contemporary context in its catalogue.[5] With a $2,500 advance,[15] Columbia granted Carlos and Elkind artistic freedom to produce and release the album. Carlos performs with additional synthesizers played by Folkman and with Elkind as producer. Recording was a dragged-out and time-consuming process as the instrument could only be played one note at a time.[16]\nReleased in October 1968,[17] Switched-On Bach became an unexpected commercial and critical success and helped to draw attention to the synthesizer as a genuine musical instrument.[16][18] Newsweek dedicated a full page to Carlos with the caption \"Plugging into the Steinway of the future.\u201d[5] It peaked at No. 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart and was No. 1 on its Classical Albums chart from January 1969 to January 1972. It was the second classical album to sell over one million copies and was certified Gold in 1969 and Platinum in 1986 by the Recording Industry Association of America.[19][20] Carlos performed selections from the album on stage with a synthesizer with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, the first of only two live performances since her days as a student (the other being with the Kurzweil Baroque Ensemble for \"Bach at the Beacon\" in 1997).[21][15] In 1970, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance\u00a0\u2013 Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording. Carlos released a follow-up, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer, with synthesized pieces from multiple composers. Released in November 1969, the album reached No. 199 on the Billboard 200 and received two Grammy nominations. The success of both albums allowed Carlos to move into Elkind's more spacious New York City home in 1971.[5]\n\n1970s[edit]\nAfter the release of Switched-On Bach, Carlos was invited to compose the soundtrack of two science fiction films, Marooned (1969), directed by John Sturges, and A Clockwork Orange (1971) by Stanley Kubrick. When the directors of Marooned changed their minds about including a soundtrack, Carlos chose to work with Kubrick, as she and Elkind were fans of his previous films, adding: \"We finally wound up talking with someone who had a close connection to Stanley Kubrick's lawyer. We suddenly got an invitation to fly to London.\"[22] Before Carlos knew about the offer, she read the book and began writing a piece based on it named \"Timesteps\". A soundtrack containing only the film cuts of the score was released as Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange in 1972, combining synthesized and classical music by Henry Purcell, Beethoven and Gioacchino Rossini with an early use of a vocoder. The album peaked the Billboard 200 chart at No. 146.[23] Later that year, Carlos released an album of music not included in the final score titled Walter Carlos' Clockwork Orange. Carlos later described the project as \"a lot of fun ... a pleasurable venture\".[22]\nCarlos experimented with ambient music on her third studio album Sonic Seasonings, released as a double album in 1972, with one side-long track dedicated to each of the four seasons. Recorded as early as 1970 and finished in mid-1971, before the A Clockwork Orange project was complete, Carlos wished to produce music that did not require \"lengthy concentrated listening\", but more than a collection of ambient noises to portray an environment.[24] It combined field recordings of animals and nature with synthesized sounds, occasionally employing melodies, to create soundscapes. It reached No. 168 in the Billboard 200 and influenced other artists who went on to pursue the ambient and new-age genres in later years.[25]\nBy 1973, Columbia/CBS Records had received a considerable number of requests for Carlos to produce another album of synthesized classical music. She agreed to the request, opting to produce a sequel to Switched-On Bach, which began with her and Elkind seeking compositions that were most suitable for the synthesizer; the two picked selections from Suite No. 2 in B minor, Two-Part Inventions in A minor and major, Suite from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, and Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major. The latter features a Yamaha E-5 Electone organ for certain passages, as a reliable polyphonic keyboard had not been developed. The result, Switched-On Bach II, was released in 1973 and sold over 70,000 copies in the US during the first five weeks of its release.[26]\nFollowing Switched-On Bach II, Carlos changed musical directions once more. In 1971, she and Elkind had asked Columbia Records to attach a pre-paid business reply card in each new pressing of her albums, which resulted in a considerable amount of suggestions from the public regarding the subject of her future releases.[27] The ideas received were divided; some asked for more classical adaptations, while others wanted more of Carlos' original compositions. Carlos decided, \"If I was going to spend months for mere minutes of music, I certainly wasn't going to be pigeonholed into only retreading existing music\", and so began a process of \"re-directing new ideas, reworking old ones\". By mid-1974, Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the flexibility of the instrument.[28] Released as By Request in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, two of Carlos' compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of \"Eleanor Rigby\" by The Beatles and \"What's New Pussycat?\", originally sung by Tom Jones.[27] The final track, a \"witty and serious\" set of variations based on themes by Edward Elgar, was replaced with tracks from The Well-Tempered Synthesizer on UK pressings after members of Elgar's estate refused to have his music presented in this style, which \"devastated\" Carlos.[28] Between 1974 and 1980 she scored several short films for producer Dick Young for UNICEF (seven of which were released in 2005 on Rediscovering Lost Scores, Vol.1).[22][29]\nBy Request was followed by Switched-On Brandenburgs, a double album containing all six of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos played on a synthesizer, in 1980.[30]\n\n1980s[edit]\nCarlos reunited with Kubrick to compose the score for his psychological horror film The Shining (1980). Before filming began, Carlos and Elkind read the book, as per Kubrick's suggestion, for musical inspiration. Carlos recorded a considerable amount of music, but Kubrick ended up using existing music by several avant-garde composers he had used as guide tracks in the final version. The Shining (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), released in 1980 on Warner Bros. Records, features two tracks credited to Carlos and Elkind: the main title theme and \"Rocky Mountains\", the former a reinterpretation of the \"Dies Irae\" section of Symphonie fantastique by Hector Berlioz. Some of Carlos' music had some legal issues regarding its release, but much of it was made available in 2005 as part of her two-volume compilation album Rediscovering Lost Scores.[citation needed]\nWith work on The Shining complete, Elkind ended her long-time collaboration with Carlos when she moved to France with her husband in 1980. Carlos remained in New York City, sharing a converted loft in Greenwich Village with her new business partner Annemarie Franklin, which housed her new, remodelled studio, which was enclosed in a Faraday cage to shield the equipment from white noise and outside interference from radio and television signals.[31]\nCarlos' first project with Franklin began around 1980, when The Walt Disney Company asked her to record the soundtrack to its science fiction feature Tron (1982). Carlos agreed, but was not interested in composing solely with electronic music, as she wished to incorporate an orchestra with her musical ideas. She recalled their demands were \"tightly specified ... there wasn't a lot of elbow room, and that made it fun\".[22] The score incorporated Carlos' analog and digital synthesizers with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the UCLA Chorus, and the Royal Albert Hall Organ.[32] Tron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released in 1982 and reached No. 135 on the Billboard 200. Carlos intended to release her scores on her own album, but Columbia/CBS showed a lack of interest in the prospect.[22]\nThree studio albums from Carlos were released in the 1980s. The first was Digital Moonscapes in 1984, Carlos' first to only feature digital synthesizers. She wrote the album's tracks for orchestra \"or orchestra replica\", inspired by various astronomical subjects, which used some leftover material from her score to Tron. Soon after, Carlos secured a deal with Audion Records, a smaller label, as she wished to \"get away from that kind of big, monolithic government-like aspect that [she] had dealt with for so many years\".[10] In 1986, Audion released Beauty in the Beast, which saw Carlos experiment with just intonation, Balinese scales, and four new microtonal scales she devised for the album: Harmonic, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.[33] The album features the first instance of a 35-note octave.[10] Carlos considers the album as the most important of her career. She followed the album with Secrets of Synthesis in 1987, her final album for CBS/Columbia, featuring several introductions and demonstrations of synthesized music from Carlos with audio examples from her previous albums.[citation needed]\nIn 1988, CBS Records asked Carlos to collaborate with comical musician \"Weird Al\" Yankovic to release a parody of Peter and the Wolf by Sergei Prokofiev. Carlos agreed to the project, as she felt it presented a chance \"to let your sense of humor out of the cage\".[10] Yankovic adapted and narrated its story, while Carlos rearranged the music with a \"MIDI orchestra\", her first venture using the digital interface.[10] The album's second side also contains a humorous adaptation of The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns titled \"The Carnival of the Animals\u2013Part II\", with Yankovic providing funny poems for each of the featured animals in the style of poet Ogden Nash, who did similar for the original.[34] Released in October 1988, Peter and the Wolf/Carnival of the Animals\u2013Part II was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album for Children in 1989.[35]\n\n1990s\u20132000s[edit]\nTo mark the 25th anniversary of Switched-On Bach, Carlos re-recorded the album with her set of digital instruments and recording techniques. Released in 1992 on Telarc Records, Switched-On Bach 2000 took roughly one and a half years to produce; Carlos estimated around 3,000 hours were invested in the project, which involved using several digital audio workstation software packages, including Pro Tools. A Moog synthesizer is only used once on the record; the rest is performed on 13 modern synthesizers. The album also marked her first venture into mixing in Dolby Surround sound.[36]\nCarlos wrote the soundtrack to the British film Brand New World (1998), also known as Woundings, directed by Roberta Hanley and based on a play by Jeff Noon. Carlos explained the style of her music: \"I was given fairly large carte blanche to do some horrific things and also some inside-psyche mood paintings, and that's what the film became\".[22]\nIn 1998, Carlos released her most recent studio album, Tales from Heaven and Hell, for the East Side Digital label.[37]\nBeginning in 1998, Carlos digitally remastered her studio albums, culminating in the Switched-On Box Set released in 1999 featuring her four synthesized classical albums.[citation needed]\nIn 2005, the two-volume set Rediscovering Lost Scores was released, featuring previously out-of-print material, including the unreleased soundtrack to Woundings and music recorded for A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Tron that was not used in the films.[38][39]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGender transition[edit]\nCarlos became aware of her gender dysphoria at an early age, recalling: \"I was about five or six... I remember being convinced I was a little girl, much preferring long hair and girls' clothes, and not knowing why my parents didn't see it clearly\".[5] While at Brown, she went on a date with a girl and felt \"so jealous of her I was beside myself\".[15] Sometime after entering graduate school (Columbia University) in the fall of 1962 she encountered studies of transgender issues for the first time, which explained to her what she was feeling.  In the summer of 1966 New York sexologist and pioneering transgender advocate Harry Benjamin published his landmark book The Transsexual Phenomenon, and in the fall of 1967 Carlos began counseling with him (well before Switched-On Bach).[15] By early 1968 Carlos had begun hormone replacement treatments under Benjamin's care, which began altering her appearance.[5][40][41] This created some problems for Carlos when Switched-On Bach became an unexpected hit after its release in October 1968.  Prior to a live performance of excerpts from the album with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Carlos felt terrified to appear in public. She cried in her hotel room and left wearing fake sideburns and a man's wig, and drew facial hair on her face with an eyebrow pencil to disguise herself as a man. Carlos did the same thing when she met Kubrick and for an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show in 1970.[15] Finally, the commercial success of Switched-On Bach allowed Carlos to undergo sex reassignment surgery in May 1972,[3] although for marketing reasons she released two more albums as Walter Carlos (1973's Switched On Bach II and 1975's By Request.)[15]\nCarlos disclosed her transgender status in a series of interviews with Arthur Bell held between December 1978 and January 1979 and published in the May 1979 issue of Playboy magazine. She explained that Playboy had \"always been concerned with liberation, and [I was] anxious to liberate myself\".[5] In 1985, Carlos spoke about the reaction to her transition: \"The public turned out to be amazingly tolerant or, if you wish, indifferent ... There had never been any need of this charade to have taken place. It had proven a monstrous waste of years of my life.\"[15] The first album released after the Playboy interview, Switched-On Brandenburgs (1980) and all subsequent releases and re-releases have been issued under Wendy's name.\n\nLawsuit[edit]\nIn 1998, Carlos sued the songwriter/artist Momus for $22\u00a0million regarding the song \"Walter Carlos\" (from the album The Little Red Songbook, released that year), which postulated that the post\u2013sex reassignment surgery Wendy could travel back in time to marry her pre-transition self, Walter.[42] The case was settled out of court, with Momus agreeing to remove the song from subsequent editions of the CD and owing $30,000 in legal fees.[43]\n\nBiography[edit]\nA Carlos biography was published by Oxford University Press in 2020. The author was unable to secure interviews with the artist or anyone close to her.[44] On her personal website, Carlos describes the work as \"fiction\" that mischaracterizes her life and deceased parents.[45]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nSwitched-On Bach was the winner of three 1969 Grammy Awards:[46][47]\n\nAlbum of the Year, Classical\nBest Classical Performance\u00a0\u2013 Instrumental Soloist Or Soloists (With Or Without Orchestra)\nBest Engineered Recording, Classical\nIn 2005, Carlos was the recipient of the SEAMUS Lifetime Achievement Award \"in recognition of lifetime achievement and contribution to the art and craft of electro-acoustic music\" by the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States.[48]\n\nOther[edit]\nCarlos contributed a review of the then-available synthesizers to the June 1971 edition of the Whole Earth Catalog, contrasting the Moog, Buchla and Tonus (aka ARP) systems. She was dismissive of smaller systems like the EMS Putney and the Minimoog as \"toys\" and \"cash-ins\".[11]\nCarlos is also an accomplished solar eclipse photographer. Her work has been published online by NASA[49][50][51][52][53] and has appeared on the cover of Sky & Telescope. She has developed various techniques for the extension of dynamic range in eclipse photography by the use of digital composites.[citation needed]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nStudio albums[edit]\nSwitched-On Bach (1968)\nThe Well-Tempered Synthesizer (1969)\nSonic Seasonings (1972)\nWalter Carlos's Clockwork Orange (1972; reissued in 2000 as A Clockwork Orange: Wendy Carlos's Complete Original Score)\nSwitched-On Bach II (1973)\nBy Request (1975)\nSwitched-On Brandenburgs (1980)\nDigital Moonscapes (1984)\nBeauty in the Beast (1986)\nSecrets of Synthesis (1987)\nPeter & the Wolf (1988; with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic)\nSwitched-On Bach 2000 (1992)\nTales of Heaven and Hell (1998)\nSoundtracks[edit]\nA Clockwork Orange (1971)\nThe Shining (1980)\nTron (1982)\nRediscovering Lost Scores, Volume 1 (2005; compiles previously unreleased music from The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and several UNICEF films)\nRediscovering Lost Scores, Volume 2 (2005; compiles previously unreleased music from The Shining, Tron, Split Second, Woundings and two Dolby demonstration tracks)\nCompilations[edit]\nSwitched-On Brandenburgs, Vol. I (1987; comprises the first LP of Switched-On Brandenburgs (1979) and selections from Switched-On Bach II (1973).)\nSwitched-On Brandenburgs, Vol. II (1987; comprises the second LP of Switched-On Brandenburgs (1979), selections from Switched-On Bach II (1973), and Bach's \"Little\" Fugue in G minor, BWV 578 from By Request (1975).)\nSwitched-On Boxed Set (1999; compiles Switched-On Bach, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer, Switched-On Bach II and Switched-On Brandenburgs)\nAppears on[edit]\nElectronic Music (1967 from Vox Turnabout.

Carrera is a transgender woman and a transgender rights activist.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n2 Personal life\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nCarrera was born in Elmwood Park, New Jersey.[5][6][7] In 2011, she appeared in the third season of the reality television competition show, RuPaul's Drag Race. Carrera is the second contestant in the history of the show (after season three castmate, Shangela) to rejoin the cast after being eliminated, and along with Raja, Manila Luzon, and Delta Work, was part of the clique known as the \"Heathers\", which took its name from the 1988 film, Heathers.[8] In episode 10, \"RuPaul-a-Palooza\", Carrera was eliminated for her performance while lip-synching to a reggae-inspired cover of RuPaul's song \"Superstar\".[9] Judges Michelle Visage, Santino Rice, and Billy Brasfield voted to re-invite Carrera to the competition in episode 12, \"Jocks in Frocks\". Subsequently, Carrera was eliminated in that episode after styling a muscular male athlete in her own signature \"nude\"-style of drag.\nThe November 2011 issue of W featured a series of fictional products in realistically styled advertisements as part of an issue-wide art project. Carrera was featured in the series as the face for the fictional fragrance La Femme.[10] In 2011, Carrera, along with third season Drag Race contestants Manila Luzon and Shangela Laquifa Wadley, appeared in a television commercial for the travel-related website Orbitz.[11]\nCarrera has also been active in AIDS awareness and activism. After being featured in a Gilead Sciences ad titled \"Red Ribbon Runway\" with fellow Drag Race co-stars Manila Luzon, Delta Work, Shangela Laquifa Wadley, and Alexis Mateo,[12] the dress she wore was auctioned by Logo in commemoration of World AIDS Day. Proceeds from the auction were donated to the National Association of People with AIDS.[13]\nCarrera appeared as a \"drag professor\" in two episodes of the second season of RuPaul's Drag U. In the episode \"80s Ladies\", she gave singer Stacey Q a confidence-boosting makeover.[14] Carrera appeared in recording artist Lovari's music video for \"Take My Pain Away\".[15]\nIn an episode of the ABC news program Primetime: What Would You Do? that aired on May 4, 2012, Carrera portrayed the role of a transgender server working in a New Jersey diner. An actor playing a customer berates Carrera's character regarding his past experience of being served by her when she had presented as male, prompting other customers to come to Carrera's defense. This program also marked the first occasion in which Carrera publicly revealed herself to be transgender.[16]\nOn June 11, 2012, Carrera appeared in an episode of the TLC series Cake Boss, \"Bar Mitzvah, Beads & Oh Baby!\", in which she unknowingly participated in a prank involving \"Cousin Anthony\" Bellifemine, the cousin of \"Cake Boss\" Buddy Valastro, who was set up with a date with Carrera. The punchline of the joke had Valastro tell Bellifemine that \"...\u00a0that's a man, baby!\" Carrera, however, originally agreed to appear on the program to promote equality for the transgender community, not aware that she would be involved in a joke. Following the airing of the program, Carrera rebuked the situation on Facebook:[17]\n\nBy calling me a 'MAN' promotes ignorance and makes it ok to call transgender women, men. PEOPLE GET BULLIED, BEAT UP, AND KILLED FOR BEING TRANS BECAUSE OF THIS IGNORANCE! ... I made it VERY clear to the producers on how to use the correct wording before agreeing to filming this but instead they chose to poke fun and be disrespectful. That's not what Im [sic] about! ... I may not have been born a woman, but im [sic] NOT a man. I told them I wouldn't mind if they said 'born male' or 'was a male'. After taking this journey it's not fair at all to be lied to by the producers.[17][18]\n Carrera with David LaChapelle at Life Ball 2014\nValastro subsequently apologized for the incident, saying that\n\nI owe an apology to the entire LGBT community. It was absolutely not my intention to upset or offend her, or anyone within the community, and I was wrong to use the words I did. I am a supporter of gay rights and equality, and while I regret this situation and my choice of words, I am thankful to have received this feedback and the opportunity to learn from this mistake. I hope that Carmen accepts my sincere regrets.[17][19]\nThe following day, on June 12, 2012, TLC announced that \"Bar Mitzvah, Beads & Oh Baby!\" has been pulled from rotation indefinitely; the network has plans to re-edit the episode for future broadcast.[20]\nA petition started requesting that Carrera serve as a model during the 2013 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, but despite media coverage and approximately 45,000 signatures the petition was unsuccessful.[21]\nIn March 2014, Carrera openly criticized RuPaul for use of the pejorative \"she-male\" on a RuPaul's Drag Race episode.[22] She continued to be critical of RuPaul when the issue arose again in 2015, after Logo pulled the \"Female or SheMale\"[23] game from DragRace, which prompted RuPaul to defend the use of the word \"tranny\".[24] Carrera's continued protests led to accusations by others that she was biting the hand that fed her.[24] Carrera responded that, while she appreciates the opportunity to compete on DragRace, she ultimately earned her status through her efforts and those of her agent, friends, fans, and family, and that she was not beholden to support RuPaul's use of transphobic language.[24]\nCarrera was featured in the work of photographer David LaChapelle. She posed for a poster for Life Ball, depicted with both male and female genitalia to represent the blurring of gender identity.[25]\nIn 2014, Carrera was included as part of the Advocate's annual \"40 under 40\" list[26] and made a cameo appearance on Jane the Virgin's premier episode.[27]\nAlso in 2014, Carrera was featured on the fifth anniversary cover of C\u2606NDY magazine along with thirteen other transgender women: Janet Mock, Laverne Cox, Geena Rocero, Isis King, Gisele Alicea, Leyna Ramous, Dina Marie, Nina Poon, Juliana Huxtable, Niki M'nray, P\u00eache Di, Carmen Xtravaganza and Yasmine Petty.[28]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nCarrera was in a domestic partnership with Adrian Torres since 2009, but she announced in 2013 that they had separated.[29] In 2015, the two were together, receiving relationship counseling while being filmed for the Couples Therapy television show. They wed on June 10, 2015, during filming for the show, which aired as the season finale on December 9, 2015.[30]\nCarrera had identified as a gay man,[29] and continued to present as such during filming of the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race, but began her gender transition when she concluded filming.[31] She is of Puerto Rican-Peruvian ancestry.[31][32]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Who is she?

Cashier(November, 1864)[1]Birth nameJennie Irene HodgersBorn(1843-12-25)December 25, 1843[2]Clogherhead, County Louth, IrelandDiedOctober 10, 1915(1915-10-10) (aged\u00a071)Saunemin, Illinois, U.S.BuriedSaunemin, Illinois, U.S.Allegiance United States of America\nUnion\nService/branch United States Army\nUnion Army\nYears\u00a0of service1862\u20131865RankPrivateUnit95th Illinois Infantry, Company GBattles/warsVicksburg, Red River, GuntownOther\u00a0workCemetery worker, janitor, lamplighter\nAlbert D. J. Cashier (December 25, 1843 \u2013 October 10, 1915), born Jennie Irene Hodgers, was an Irish-born immigrant who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Cashier adopted the identity of a man before enlisting, and maintained it until death. Cashier became famous as one of a number of women soldiers who served as men during the Civil War, although the consistent and long-term (at least 53 years) commitment to a male identity has prompted some contemporary scholars to suggest that Cashier was a trans man.[3][4][5][6]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Enlistment\n3 During the war\n4 Postwar\n5 Death and legacy\n6 See also\n7 Notes\n8 References\n9 Further reading\n10 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nCashier was very elderly and disoriented when interviewed about immigrating to the United States and enlisting in the army, and had always been evasive about early life; therefore, the available narratives are often contradictory. According to later investigation by the administrator of Cashier's estate, Albert Cashier was born Jennie Hodgers in Clogherhead, County Louth, Ireland on December 25, 1843,[7]:52[2] to Sallie and Patrick Hodgers.[2] Typically, the youth's uncle or stepfather was said to have dressed his charge in male clothing in order to find work in an all-male shoe factory in Illinois. Even before the advent of the war, Jenny adopted the identity of Albert Cashier in order to live independently.[7]:52 Sallie Hodgers, Cashier's mother, was known to have died prior to 1862, by which time her child had traveled as a stowaway to Belvidere, Illinois, and was working as a farmhand to a man named Avery.[8][9][10]\n\nEnlistment[edit]\nCashier first enlisted in July 1862 after President Lincoln's call for soldiers.[7]:52 As time passed, the need for soldiers only increased. On August 6, 1862, the eighteen-year-old enlisted in the 95th Illinois Infantry for a three-year term using the name \"Albert D.J. Cashier\" and was assigned to Company G.[11][12][7]:52 Cashier was listed in the company catalog as nineteen years old upon enlistment, and small in stature.[note 1]\nMany Belvidere boys had been at the Battle of Shiloh as members of the Fifteenth Illinois Volunteers, where the Union had suffered heavy losses. Cashier took the train along with other boys from Belvidere to Rockford in order to enlist, in answer to the call for more soldiers.[13]:380 Along with others from Boone and McHenry counties, Cashier learned how to be a volunteer infantryman of the 95th Regiment at Camp Fuller. After being shipped out by steamer and rail to Confederate strongholds in Columbus, Kentucky and Jackson, Tennessee, the 95th was ordered to Grand Junction where it became part of the Army of the Tennessee under General Ulysses S. Grant.[13]:380\u2013381\n\nDuring the war[edit]\nThe regiment was part of the Army of the Tennessee under Ulysses S. Grant and fought in approximately forty battles,[12] including the siege at Vicksburg. [13]:381  During this campaign, Cashier was captured while performing reconnaissance,[7]:55 but managed to escape and return to the regiment. After the Battle of Vicksburg, in June 1863, Cashier contracted chronic diarrhea and entered a military hospital, somehow managing to evade detection.[7]:55\u201356\nIn the spring of 1864, the regiment was also present at the Red River Campaign under General Nathaniel Banks, and in June 1864 at the Battle of Brice's Crossroads in Guntown, Mississippi, where they suffered heavy casualties.[7]:56\u201357[13]:382\u2013383\nFollowing a period to recuperate and regroup following the debacle at Brice, the 95th, now a seasoned and battle-hardened regiment, saw additional action in the Winter of 1864 in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, at the battles of Spring Hill and Franklin, the defense of Nashville, and the pursuit of General Hood.[13]:383\nDuring the war, the regiment traveled a total of about 9,000 miles.[7]:52[note 2] Other soldiers thought that Cashier was small and preferred to be alone, which were not uncommon characteristics for soldiers. Cashier fought with the regiment through the war until honorably discharged on August 17, 1865, when all the soldiers were mustered out.[7]:57\nCashier was only one of at least 250 soldiers who were assigned female at birth and enlisted as men to fight in the Civil War.[14][15]\n\nPostwar[edit]\n Cashier's postwar residence, since moved to Saunemin\nAfter the war, Cashier returned to Belvidere, Illinois for a time, working for Samuel Pepper and continuing to live as a man.[7]:57[16] Settling in Saunemin, Illinois in 1869, Cashier worked as a farmhand as well as performing odd jobs around the town.[7]:57 and can be found in the town payroll records.[7]:57 Cashier lived with employer Joshua Chesbro and his family in exchange for work, and had also slept for a time in the Cording Hardware store in exchange for labor. In 1885, the Chesbro family had a small house built for Cashier.[17] For over forty years, Cashier lived in Saunemin and was a church janitor, cemetery worker, and street lamplighter. Living as a man allowed Cashier to vote in elections and to later claim a veteran's pension under the same name.[7]:58 Pension payments started in 1907.[18]\nIn later years, Cashier ate with the neighboring Lannon family. The Lannons discovered their friend's sex when Cashier fell ill, but decided not to make their discovery public.[7]:59\nIn 1911, Cashier, who was working for State Senator Ira Lish, was hit by the Senator's car, resulting in a broken leg.[7]:59 A physician found out the patient's secret in the hospital, but did not disclose the information. No longer able to work, Cashier was moved to the Soldiers and Sailors home in Quincy, Illinois on May 5, 1911. Many friends and fellow soldiers from the Ninety-fifth Regiment visited.[7]:59 Cashier lived there until an obvious deterioration of mind began to take place and was moved to the Watertown State Hospital for the Insane in March 1914.[7]:60 Attendants at the Watertown State Hospital discovered Cashier's sex, at which point, the patient was made to wear women's clothes again after what we can assume would be more than fifty years.[7]:60 In 1914, Cashier was investigated for fraud by the veterans' pension board; former comrades confirmed that Cashier was in fact the person who had fought in the Civil War and the board decided in February 1915 that payments should continue for life.[19][20][21]\n\nDeath and legacy[edit]\nAlbert Cashier died on October 10, 1915 and was buried in uniform. The tombstone was inscribed \"Albert D. J. Cashier, Co. G, 95 Ill. Inf.\"[11] Cashier was given an official Grand Army of the Republic funerary service, and was buried with full military honors.[7]:60 It took W.J. Singleton (executor of Cashier's estate) nine years to track Cashier's identity back to the birth name of Jennie Hodgers. None of the would-be heirs proved convincing, and the estate of about $282 (after payment of funeral expenses)[20][21][22] was deposited in the Adams County, Illinois, treasury. The name on the original tombstone is Albert D. J. Cashier. In the 1970s, a second tombstone, inscribed with both names, was placed near the first one at Sunny Slope cemetery in Saunemin, Illinois.[11][23]\nCashier is listed on the internal wall of the Illinois memorial at Vicksburg National Military Park.[24]\nA musical entitled The Civility of Albert Cashier has been produced based on Cashier's life; the work was described by the Chicago Tribune as \"A timely musical about a trans soldier\".[25]\nAlso Known As Albert D. J. Cashier: The Jennie Hodgers Story is a biography written by veteran Lon P. Dawson, who lived at the Illinois Veterans Home where Cashier once lived. The novel My Last Skirt, by Lynda Durrant, is based on Cashier's life. Cashier was mentioned in a collection of essays called Nine Irish Lives, in which Cashier's biography was written by Jill McDonough.[26]\nCashier's house has been restored in Saunemin.[27]\nAuthors including Michael Bronski, James Cromwell, Kirstin Cronn-Mills, and Nicholas Teich have suggested or argued that Cashier was a trans man due to living as a man for at least 53 years.[3][4][5][6]\n\nSee also[edit]\nAmelio Robles \u00c1vila, Mexican revolutionary\nChristian Davies\nJames Barry (surgeon)\nJohn/Eleanor Rykener\nHannah Snell\nRalph Kerwineo\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Sources differ about how tall Cashier was. Some say 5'3\" [7]:54 and others say 5 feet.[13]:380 In addition, Tsui claims Cashier was blue-eyed, with auburn hair and a fair complexion,:54 while Clausius says \"dark-haired\".:380 \n\n^ According to the regimental historian, the 95th had traveled 9,960 miles in three years of campaigns.[13]:384 \n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"What part am I to act in this great drama?\" (PDF).

Cayne performed in New York City nightclubs in drag since the 1990s,[3] and came out as transgender in 1996; Cayne came to national attention in 2007 for portraying transgender mistress Carmelita on ABC's prime time drama Dirty Sexy Money.[4][5][6] The role makes Cayne the first transgender actress to play a recurring transgender character in primetime.[7][8]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Activism and personal life\n4 Filmography\n\n4.1 Film\n4.2 Television\n4.3 Music videos\n\n\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nShe has a fraternal twin brother named Dylan. Their parents taught at a Waldorf School, and the family lived on campus.[9] She graduated from Henry Perrine Baldwin High School in Hawaii in 1989[2] and then spent a year in Los Angeles, where she trained as a dancer.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\nCayne then moved to New York in the early 1990s, making a name for herself as a choreographer and drag performer.[3] About three years after her arrival in NYC, Cayne realized that the term transgender described how she felt about herself.[3] Already performing as \"Candis Cayne\" at New York gay bar Boy Bar and as a featured performer at Tour in New York's Chelsea, the entertainer also participated in Wigstock, the annual drag festival in Manhattan's East Village. In 1995 Cayne appeared in the related documentary film Wigstock: The Movie, the comedy-drama film Stonewall, and the Universal Studios comedy feature film To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, for which she also did choreography.[10]\nIn 1996, she had a supporting role in the comedy-drama film Always Something Better (a.k.a. Never Look Back).[11] In 1997 Cayne was in a documentary called Drag Time on HBO along with many other famous New York nightlife performers. Candis also co-starred in the music video for RuPaul's \"A Little Bit of Love\" with female impersonator Jazzmun. Cayne also starred as the title character in the 1998 independent film Mob Queen, and won the 2001 Miss Continental pageant.[12][13] In 2007 Cayne was cast as Annaka Manners in the 2007 RuPaul film Starrbooty.\nFrom 2007 to 2008 Cayne played Carmelita Rainer, a trans woman having an affair with married New York Attorney General Patrick Darling (played by William Baldwin), on the ABC prime time drama Dirty Sexy Money.[4][5][6] She had a recurring role as the transgender character Alexis Stone in season six of Nip/Tuck.[14] Cayne has appeared as a judge and Dean of Dance on RuPaul's Drag U. As a dance teacher, she taught contestants original choreography to \"No Scrubs\" by TLC and Kelis's song \"Milkshake\". In 2011, she guest-starred on the TV show Necessary Roughness as Geraldine.\nIn 2015, Cayne started making appearances in seasons 1 and 2 of Caitlyn Jenner's reality show I Am Cait.[15]\nFrom 2017 to 2018, Cayne played the role of The Fairy Queen in the Syfy series The Magicians. Cayne appeared in the 2020 documentary Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen.[16] She also hosted the third edition of Werq the World's livestreamed series.[17]\n\nActivism and personal life[edit]\nCayne began transitioning circa 1996.[2] Cayne has stated, \"I'm not trying to be a spokeswoman for the transgender community; I just want to be looked at as a living, breathing, happy human being.\"[5] She calls the LGBT community \"the last great minority\" and supports the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[5]\nIn August 2015, Candis Cayne teamed up with the global LGBT social network MOOVZ as the new global creative director.[18]\nFor over eight years, ending in 2010, Cayne was in a relationship with DJ Marco McDermott, to whom she referred as her husband.[19][20] During that time, she helped raise McDermott's daughter, Satori, from a previous relationship.\nIn 2016, during season 2 of the reality show I Am Cait, Cayne explored the possibility of adopting as a single mom.\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1995\n\nWigstock: The Movie\n\nHerself\n\nCredited as Brendan McDaniel\n\n\n1995\n\nStonewall\n\nDiva\n\n\n\n\n1995\n\nTo Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!

In 2017, she stood for election in Coventry South, receiving 1.3% of the votes. In 2018, her father, who had been serving as her election agent, was convicted and jailed for sexual offences against a child, leading to Challenor's suspension from the party during an investigation. She later resigned and joined the Liberal Democrats, but was suspended from that party in 2019.\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n2 Political career\n3 LGBT activism\n4 References\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAlthough assigned male at birth, Knight says she realised she was a girl around the age of 10, but her parents were unaware of the existence of trans people.[4] Knight and her two siblings were taken into care in 2013.[5][6] Knight came out as trans in 2014; she tells of experiencing anxiety and depression as well as online harassment.[7]\nAs a child, Knight was diagnosed with autism[8][9] and oppositional defiant disorder.[10] She was educated at Lewis Charlton Learning Centre, an independent special school for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties.[11][12] Challenor then attended Henley College Coventry, where she was the college's National Union of Students (NUS) lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) officer.[13][14] Challenor lives with her mother in Coventry and is studying for a B.A. in philosophy, politics and economics at the Open University.[15]\nDuring 2019, Knight went through the process of changing her legal gender through the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the British Government issued a new Birth Certificate recognising Challenor as female.[16]\nAs of January 2019[update], Challenor was engaged to Nathaniel Knight, who lives in the United States.[2] They married in December 2019.[17]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nKnight joined the Green Party of England and Wales in November 2014. She was the chair of LGBTIQA+ Greens (LGBT, plus intersex, queer, asexual, and other) between 2015 and 2017.[18] Challenor became the party's equality spokesperson in 2016.[15] According to the Green Party, Knight was the only trans spokesperson for a UK political party.[19]\nIn April 2017, Knight helped co-found the Global Greens LGBT+ Network alongside colleagues from Die Gr\u00fcnen, Groen, Taiwan Tree Party, and Taiwan Green Party.[20]\nIn July 2017, Knight was the Green candidate for Coventry South. She received 1.3% of the vote share, with 604 votes.[21] Knight stood for Coventry City Council elections as a member of the Green Party in February 2016[22] and May 2016.[23] She stood in a May 2018 local election.[24] She was not elected.\nKnight stood in the 2018 party election to be deputy leader, which closed at the end of August.\nIn August 2018, Knight's father David Challenor was sentenced to 22 years in prison for raping and torturing a 10-year-old girl in the attic of the home shared by him, Aimee and Tina Challenor (his wife and her mother). Knights's father had been reported to the police in 2015 and charged in November 2016. Following this, Knight chose her father as her election agent for the 2017 general election and also the 2018 council elections. Knight had given her father's name as \"Baloo Challenor\" on campaign materials, later commenting that he was known locally by this nickname.[5] After her father's sentencing, Knight \u2013 who insisted she did not know the allegations against her father in full \u2013 stood down from the Green Party's deputy leadership election.[5][6][24][25]\nKnight was consequently suspended from the party on a no-fault basis, and the party launched an inquest into possible safeguarding failures as David was allowed to act as Aimee's election agent after having been charged.[26] In September 2018, Knight resigned from the Green Party citing transphobia[27] however Knight continued to cooperate with the inquest. The inquest by Verita found in January 2019 that she had committed a \"serious error of judgement\" in appointing her father as her campaign manager.[28][29] The report also said that the Green Party, who were told by Knight that her father had been arrested but not that he was a party member, could have done more to investigate the matter.[30]\nIn October 2018, she joined the Liberal Democrats, becoming the Diversity Officer of her local party.[31][32][33] She was suspended from the Liberal Democrats in July 2019, after tweets appeared on her partner's account admitting to having sexual fantasies involving sex with children. Knight said that her partner's account had been hacked.[34][2]\n\nLGBT activism[edit]\nIn 2015, Knight was the LGBTQ Officer for Henley College Coventry; she protested the college's censoring of websites such as Birmingham Pride, which were considered \"Gay or Lesbian or Bisexual Interest\" by the college web blocker.[13][14] Knight was an organiser of Coventry Pride in 2016 and 2017.[35][36][37]\nAfter a Transport for London (TfL) helpline employee told Knight that she \"didn't sound like a Miss\", she successfully campaigned to get TfL to investigate the incident and to use gender-neutral language in announcements, avoiding phrases such as \"ladies and gentlemen\".[38][39]\nIn May 2018, the BBC published an article that quoted writer Miranda Yardley describing Knight as a \"man\". Knight said that the BBC did not contact her about the article before its publication, though following readers' complaints she was asked to comment, and her response was added to the article.[40][41]\nKnight was a member of the Trans Advisory Group for Stonewall, Britain's largest LGBT charity. She resigned in the summer of 2019 stating there was a \"hostile environment towards trans people in the UK\" and that she was concerned for her mental health and safety.[42][43]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Knight, Aimee (26 April 2020). \"Aimee Knight verified account on Twitter; \"I've stepped away from @greenslgbt by the way.

In 2012, Clayton played the lead role of Michelle Darnell on the Emmy Award winning interactive web series Dirty Work and the role of Carla Favers on the TV series Are We There Yet?[9][10][11] She also narrated the audiobook for the young adult novel George about a transgender girl.[12]\nClayton starred as one of the eight main characters in the Netflix original television series Sense8 that premiered on June 5, 2015.[13] In Sense8 she played Nomi Marks, a trans woman, political blogger, and hacker living in San Francisco.[14] Sense8 was inclusive both in and in front of the camera with co-creators sisters Lilly and Lana Wachowski being both transgender.[15] Clayton said that she was primarily interested in Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character written by a transgender filmmaker and to be on set with this person. Being a fan of science fiction and J.\u00a0Michael Straczynski in particular also attracted her to this project.[16]\nClayton appeared in the 2016 film The Neon Demon,[17] and the 2017 thriller film The Snowman.[18]\nIn 2019, Clayton starred as Sasha Booker in the third season of the Netflix's Designated Survivor.[19]\nIn 2020, Clayton stars in The L Word: Generation Q, a long awaited sequel to the ground breaking Showtime Original, The L Word, which aired for six seasons, starting in 2004. Season 2 of The L Word: Generation Q was announced by Showtime in January 2020. She is also guest starring in The CW\u2019s Roswell: New Mexico.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nClayton is transgender.[5] In 2011, she was honored by Out magazine as part of their annual \"Out 100\" awards.[20]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nFilm, television and video games roles\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2010\n\nTRANSform Me\n\nHerself\n\nReality TV series\n\n\n2011\n\nHung\n\nKyla\n\n2 episodes (season 3)\n\n\n2012\n\nDirty Work\n\nMichelle\n\nLead role\n\n\nAre We There Yet?\n\nCarla Favers\n\nEpisode: \"The Wrong Way Episode\"\n\n\n2013\n\nHustling\n\nNadya\n\nEpisode: \"Sugar\"\n\n\n2015\u20132018\n\nSense8\n\nNomi Marks\n\nMain role\n\n\n2016\n\nThe Neon Demon\n\nCasting Director\n\nFilm\n\n\nMotive\n\nAvery Bowman\n\nEpisode: \"The Dead Name\"\n\n\nBojack Horseman\n\nMom Donkey\n\nEpisode: \"Best Thing That Ever Happened\"\n\n\nSame Same\n\nNiamh\n\nEpisode: \"Scissr\"\n\n\n2017\n\nMass Effect: Andromeda\n\nJien Garson\n\nVideo game\n\n\nThe Snowman\n\nEdda\n\nFilm\n\n\nThe Chain\n\nDr. Ryan\n\nFilm\n\n\n2018\n\nSame Same\n\nNiamh\n\nWeb series\n\n\n2019\n\nDesignated Survivor\n\nSasha Booker\n\nRecurring role (season 3)[19]\n\n\n2019\u20132020\n\nThe L Word: Generation Q\n\nTess Van De Berg\n\n6 episodes\n\n\n2020\n\nRoswell, New Mexico\n\nAgent Grace Powell/Charlie Cameron\n\nRecurring\n\n\nDisclosure: Trans Lives on Screen\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary film\n\n\nEqual\n\nChristine Jorgensen\n\nDocuseries\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Jamie Clayton on Twitter: \"\"@Puckguy14: @Jamie_Clayton your birthday is in January?\" Yes!

She was the first transgender model to have posed for the Brazilian edition of Playboy.[1] She has appeared on the catwalk for numerous fashion houses, including Thierry Mugler, Guy Laroche, Jean Paul Gaultier. In addition to Playboy, Close has been featured in editorials for Vogue.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n\n3.1 Legal issues\n\n\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nClose was born in Rio de Janeiro under the name of Luiz Roberto Gambine Moreira, and as an adolescent, began to adopt feminine attire and secretly began taking female hormone injections. By the age of seventeen, Close's career as a model and actress was beginning to take off.[citation needed]\n\nCareer[edit]\nClose won the \"Miss Gay Brazil\" beauty pageant at the age of twenty. That year, she made headlines and was dubbed \"The world's most beautiful model\". She has played a cabaret singer on a popular soap opera, starred in the 1986 movie Si tu vas a Rio... tu meurs, hosted a late night talk show, and was the inspiration for a hit song by Roberto and Erasmo Carlos.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1989, Close underwent sex reassignment surgery at Charing Cross Clinic in London, England. Afterwards, she appeared in an extensive photo spread in the Brazilian men's magazine Sexy, and was subsequently voted the \"Most Beautiful Woman in Brazil.\"\nIn 1993, Close married Roland Granacher. The wedding to her Swiss husband took place in Europe, as it would not have been legal in Brazil. Close lives with Granacher in Zurich and Paris.[3]\nClose's Portuguese-language autobiography, Muito Prazer, Roberta Close (\"Much Pleasure, Roberta Close\" or \"Pleased to meet you, I'm Roberta Close\") was published in 1998. In it, she writes that she had been involved with numerous American celebrities including Eddie Murphy, George Clooney, and Robert De Niro.\nIn May 2015, Close told Brazilian television host Gugu Liberato that she recently underwent genetic testing that revealed she is intersex.[4]\n\nLegal issues[edit]\nClose was involved in a lengthy legal judicial battle to challenge the Brazilian laws which prevented her from declaring her sex as female on official documents. In 1997, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled against her. Fl\u00e1vio Giron, the federal vice-prosecutor, argued that \"the expert exams carried out have confirmed the male sexuality of the petitioner\".[This quote needs a citation] On March 4, 2005, Roberta Close acquired legal status as a female in Brazil after Judge Leise Rodrigues de Lima Espiritu Santo of the 9th Family Court of Rio de Janeiro legally recognized Close as a woman. Close's lawyer, Leandro Paiva de Medeiros, said, \"In the decision, the judge affirms that Roberta has been a woman from the time she was born; it was only that medical science in 1964 was not capable of identifying this, due to a physical problem that she had\".[This quote needs a citation]  She was issued a new birth certificate by the Office of Public Records of the 4th district of Rio de Janeiro, which states that on December 7, 1964, a child of the female sex was born and was given the name \"Roberta Gambine Moreira\".[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"10 Gorgeous Women (Who Were Born Male)\" Retrieved 20 August 2015\n\n^ \"FRAN\u00c7A: Roberta Close participar\u00e1 de editorial da Vogue\" Retrieved 24 November 2015\n\n^ Dama na Su\u00ed\u00e7a, Roberta Close completa 50 anos, e amigos entregam que ela n\u00e3o quer voltar ao Brasil com medo do preconceito\n\n^ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRj0bm83wkc\n\n^ Roberta Close - News of court decision in Brazil, April 2005\n\n\nExternal links[edit]\nLuiz Gambine Moreira - \"Roberta Close\"\nRoberta Close on IMDb\nColectivos piden en Parlamento Vasco inclusi\u00f3n en Sanidad Publica de cirug\u00edas reasignaci\u00f3n\nAuthority control \nLCCN: n98910759\nVIAF: 68252709\n WorldCat Identities: lccn-n98910759\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"Name": "Coccinelle", "Gender identity": null, "isTrans": true, "text": "This article is about the actress.

She was transgender, and was the first widely publicized post-war gender reassignment case in Europe, where she was an international celebrity and a renowned club singer.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n2 Media sensation\n3 Activism and later life\n4 Discography\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nBorn in Paris under the name of Jacques Charles Dufresnoy at rue Notre Dame de Nazareth Nr. 66 in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris, she took the stage name Coccinelle (French for \"ladybug\") when she entered show business, making her debut as a transgender showgirl in 1953 at Chez Madame Arthur where her mother was a flower seller. She later performed regularly at the famous nightclub Le Carrousel de Paris, which also featured regular acts by other famous trans women such as April Ashley and Marie-Pier Ysser.\nIn 1958, she travelled to Casablanca to undergo a vaginoplasty by Georges Burou. She said later, \"Dr Burou rectified the mistake nature had made and I became a real woman, on the inside as well as the outside. After the operation, the doctor just said, 'Bonjour, Mademoiselle', and I knew it had been a success.\"\nShe sang the title track of Premier rendez-vous, a 1941 film directed by Henri Decoin. She became a media sensation, and performed the Cherchez la femme revue which ran for 7 months at the Olympia in Paris between 1963 and 1964. In 1987 her autobiography was published, titled Coccinelle par Coccinelle.\nShe married French journalist Francis Bonnet in 1960 and was married legally by the French Roman Catholic Church after her legal name change and rebaptism. Her marriage to Bonnet was dissolved in 1962. She then married Paraguayan dancer Mario Costa in 1963, who died in 1977. She then married fellow transgender activist Thierry Wilson in 1996.\n\nMedia sensation[edit]\nShe very quickly became a media sensation upon her return to France as a woman, with a look and stage act based on the prominent sex symbols of the day. Historian Joanne Meyerowitz wrote \"the more sexualized MTF showed up in the sensationalized press in the stories on Coccinelle, who worked at Le Carrousel in Paris\".[2][3] In 1959 she appeared in Europa di notte by director Alessandro Blasetti. That same year, Italian singer Ghigo Agosti dedicated the song Coccinella to her, provoking widespread consternation and controversy. Coccinelle appeared in the 1962 film Los Viciosos and was the first French trans woman to become a major star, when Bruno Coquatrix splashed her name in red letters on the front of Paris Olympia for her 1963 revue, Cherchez la femme. She later appeared in the 1968 film D\u00edas de viejo color.\nIn Israeli slang, the word coccinelle (by Hebrew transliteration - \u05e7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05dc, pronounced [koksi\u02c8nel]) is used as a synonym for transgender, often derogatorily (and also as a general slur for a feminine man).[4]\n\nActivism and later life[edit]\nCoccinelle worked extensively as an activist on behalf of transgender people, founding the organization \"Devenir Femme\" (To Become Woman), which was designed to provide emotional and practical support for those seeking gender reassignment surgery. She also helped establish the Center for Aid, Research, and Information for Transsexuality and Gender Identity. In addition, her first marriage was the first union to be officially acknowledged by the government of France, establishing transgender persons' legal right to marry.[5] Her 1987 autobiography Coccinelle was published by Daniel Filipacchi.[6] Coccinelle was hospitalized in July 2006 following a stroke and died on 6 October at Marseille.[7]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nCoccinelle No 1 (President Records No 38.\" cda 1052)\n\nTu t'fous de moi [You don't care about me]\nL'Amour a fleur de coeur [Love has a heart like a flower]\nPrends-moi ou laisse-moi [Take me or leave me]\nTu es l\u00e0 [You are there]\nCoccinelle No 2 (President Records No 12\" cda 1052)\n\nJe cherche un millionnaire [I'm looking for a millionaire]\nAvec mon petit faux-cul [With my little false bottom]\nCoccinelle - 4 chansons de la Revue de l'Olympia \"Chercher la femme\" (RCA VICTOR 86.012M - 1963)\n\nCherchez la femme [Look for the woman]\nOn fait tout \u00e0 la main [Everything is done by hand]\nC'est s\u00fbrement vous [It's probably you]\nDepuis toujours [Since forever]\nStar du Carrousel de Paris CD (Marianne Melodie 041625) Compilation of 20 titles.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"GLAAD Media Reference Guide - Transgender\".

F. Connell (father)RelativesPatricia Margaret Selkirk (sister)AwardsJessie Bernard Award\nRaewyn Connell, usually cited as R. W. Connell, is an Australian sociologist. She gained prominence as an intellectual of the Australian New Left.[1] She was appointed University Professor at the University of Sydney in 2004, and retired from her University Chair on July, 2014.[2] She has been Professor Emerita at the University of Sydney since her retirement. She is known for the concept of hegemonic masculinity and her book, Southern Theory.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n2 Major contributions\n\n2.1 Class and education\n2.2 Gender\n2.3 Masculinity\n2.4 Southern theory\n\n\n3 Selected bibliography\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nConnell was born on 3 January 1944 in Sydney, Australia. Her father, William Fraser (Bill) Connell (OBE), was a Professor of Education at the University of Sydney for many years, where he focused on educational research and teaching. Her mother, Margaret Lloyd Connell (n\u00e9e Peck) was a high school science teacher. Connell has two sisters, Patricia Margaret Selkirk and Helen Connell.[3][4][5][6]\nConnell was educated at Manly and North Sydney High Schools, and has degrees from the University of Melbourne and University of Sydney. She has held academic positions at universities in Australia, including being the founding professor of sociology at Macquarie University 1976\u20131991. \nIn the United States Connell was visiting professor of Australian studies at Harvard University 1991\u20131992, and professor of sociology at University of California Santa Cruz 1992\u20131995.[7] She was a rank-and-file member of the Australian Labor Party until the early 1980s and a trade unionist, currently in the National Tertiary Education Union.\nConnell's sociology emphasises the historical nature of social reality and the transformative character of social practice.  Her writing tries to combine empirical detail, structural analysis, critique, and relevance to practice.  Much of her empirical work uses biographical (life-history) interviewing, in education, family life and workplaces. She has written or co-written twenty-one books and more than 150 research papers.[8] Her work is translated into 16 languages.[9]\nConnell serves on the editorial board or advisory board of numerous academic journals, including Signs, Sexualities, The British Journal of Sociology, Theory and Society, and The International Journal of Inclusive Education.[10][11]\nConnell is a trans woman, who completed her gender transition late in life.[12] Almost all her earlier work was published under the gender-neutral name \"R. W. Connell\", up to the second edition of  \"Masculinities\" in 2005. A few publications are under the names Bob or Robert. Since 2006 all her work has appeared under the name Raewyn Connell. Connell has also written about transsexualism.[13]\n\nMajor contributions[edit]\nClass and education[edit]\nConnell first became known for research on large-scale class dynamics (\"Ruling Class, Ruling Culture\", 1977 and \"Class Structure in Australian History\", 1980), and the ways class and gender hierarchies are re-made in the everyday life of schools (\"Making the Difference\", 1982).\n\nGender[edit]\nIn the late 1980s she developed a social theory of gender relations (\"Gender and Power\", 1987), which emphasised that gender is a large-scale social structure not just a matter of personal identity. In applied fields she has worked on poverty and education (\"Schools and Social Justice\", 1993), sexuality and AIDS prevention, and labour movement strategy (\"Socialism & Labor\", 1978).\n\nMasculinity[edit]\nConnell is best known outside Australia for studies of the social construction of masculinity.  She was one of the founders of this research field,[14] and her book \"Masculinities\" (1995, 2005) is the most-cited in the field.  The concept of hegemonic masculinity has been particularly influential and has attracted much debate.[15] She has been an advisor to UNESCO and UNO initiatives relating men, boys and masculinities to gender equality and peacemaking.\n\nSouthern theory[edit]\nConnell has developed a sociology of intellectuals that emphasises the collective character of intellectual labour, and the importance of its social context.  Her 2007 book Southern Theory extended this to the global dynamics of knowledge production, critiquing the \"Northern\" bias of mainstream social science which is predominately produced in \"metropolitan\" universities. In doing so, she argues, metropolitan social theory fails to adequately explain social phenomena in the Southern experience.\nShe analysed examples of theoretical work deriving from the global South: including the work of Paulin Hountondji, Ali Shariati, Veena Das, Ashis Nandy and Ra\u00fal Prebisch. Connell has also examined Southern theories of neoliberalism[16] and gender.[17]\n\nSelected bibliography[edit]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nPublisher\n\n\n1967\nPolitics of the Extreme Right\u00a0: Warringah, 1966 \u00a0(Co-written with Florence Gould)\nSydney University Press\n\n\n1977\nRuling Class, Ruling Culture: Studies of Conflict, Power and Hegemony in Australian Life\nCambridge University Press\n\n\n1980\nClass Structure in Australian History \u00a0 (Co-written with Terry Irving)[18]\nLongman Cheshire\n\n\n1982\nMaking the Difference: Schools, Families and Social Division \u00a0 (Co-written)\nAllen & Unwin\n\n\n1983\nWhich way is up?

She is considered to be the first openly transgender person to be elected to a city council in the United States. She served on Arvada's City Council from 1991-1995.[1] In March 1993, Conte made a public announcement revealing that she was transgender as a preemptive strike against Westword, which had been planning to publish the story on their front page.\nFollowing her short-lived political career, she became a radio host on 850 KOA, but quit after only a few episodes due to transmisogynistic advertising for her broadcast.[2] She then went on to work as an investigative reporter for KGNU Radio.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Term as councilwoman\n3 Conte v. Meyer\n4 Activism\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nJoanne Conte was born in 1933 in Rochester, N.Y.,[2] where doctors determined that her sex was male. She attended Arvada High School, and then went on to serve as a military Morse code operator for the U.S. Army and Air Force during the Korean War.[2]\nConte came out as transgender in the 1970s and legally changed her name before undergoing gender confirmation surgery in 1972,[4] which caused her family to disown her.\nConte first became involved with political organizing on a small-scale in the 1980s when she organized efforts to keep Arvada's City Council from allowing a trash transfer station to be established in a neighborhood near her own.[2]\n\nTerm as councilwoman[edit]\nIn 1991, Conte ran for Arvada City Council and, due to extensive campaigning, won.[2] She was a self-declared \"raging activist\" and focused heavily on citizen outreach during her term. She sought to make government happenings accessible to the public, so citizens could make more informed political decisions. Her actions as councilwoman show her belief in the value of citizens in government and a passion for openness and transparency.[1]\nDespite being candid in her politics, Conte was very secretive about her past. This made her adversaries suspicious enough to hire a private investigator who dug up evidence of Conte's name change and gender confirming surgery, which was then leaked to the tabloid newspaper, Westword. Word got to Conte that the tabloid was planning to run a front-page article outing her as transgender and she was forced to make the announcement herself before they could. The revelation destroyed Conte's political career, though she admitted she was relieved to no longer have to live in secrecy and felt that she helped pave the way for other trans women in politics.[5]\nIn 1994, Conte submitted a petition to run as an Independent candidate for the Colorado House of Representatives, but was denied a spot on the ballot by then Secretary of State, Natalie Meyer. Conte filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and, in the case of Conte v. Meyer, it was determined Conte would appear on the ballot by a ruling of 5-2.[2] She lost the election, largely due to the ridicule she was facing for her gender from her adversary's supporters during the campaign. Before leaving office, Conte audited the city budget and convinced the Council to cut out non-essential services in response to Arvada's declining revenue.\nIn 1994, while serving as councilwoman, Conte filed a workers' compensation claim which alleged that leaning on her desk during council meetings caused a staph infection on her right elbow.[6]\nThough her political career was over, Conte continued to be a strong activist. She began her career in radio broadcasting with 850 KOA, where her show was promoted by ads which asked \"Is it a man? Is it a woman?\" After only a few episodes, Conte left for KGNU radio, which was much better suited to her passion for politics and activism.[7] There, she broadcast news segments and weekly call-in shows, reporting on news and issues that were overlooked by other news sources and continuing to fight for those whose voices were going unheard.[1] Her shows covered topics ranging from affordable housing in the Denver area to the issue of state-approved chemical castration of pedophiles.[7]\n\nConte v. Meyer[edit]\nConte ran for Colorado State Legislature in 1994, but was almost denied ballot access.[8] Conte planned to run as an Independent and officially changed her affiliation on August 2, 1993. The deadline to turn in her petition for candidacy was August 2, 1994. She filed her petition\u2014signed by three appellants\u2014on July 18, 1994 and was told two separate times that her petition was sufficient and that any defects in the petition would be remedied before the filing deadline.\nLater, Conte filed a lawsuit against the Colorado law which stated the ballot order in which Democrats and Republicans appear should be random while stipulating other candidates always had to appear below the Democrat and Republican choices. After Conte filed the lawsuit Meyer reversed her decision to allow Conte ballot access on the grounds that she had not been an Independent for a full year when she turned in her petition. Conte appealed Meyer's decision to the Colorado Supreme Court in the case the Conte v. Meyer.[9] The Court reversed Meyer's decision by a vote of 5-2 with the majority opinion interpreting the law to mean that a petition is on file from the time it is turned in until the date it is due.[10]\n\nActivism[edit]\nIn 1996, Conte restarted an organization she had begun in 1991, Save Arvada's Residential Areas (SARA), to oppose an annexation proposed by the Arvada City Council.[11] Later that year Conte ran a petition drive to limit campaign contributions and cap spending in Arvada mayoral and council races.[12]\nIn 2003, Conte led a group of concerned citizens against storage of chemical waste in Arvada. Following the Arvada City Council's vote in favor of the storage, Conte began the process to get a referendum against the chemical storage on the ballot for the November 2003 election.[13]\nIn 2004 Conte called for a public investigation into accusations that Arvada Mayor Ken Fellman may have unlawfully removed his opponent's campaign signs.[14]\nIn the 2006 election year, during a controversy about the salaries of City Managers in Colorado, Conte supported Arvada City Manager Craig Kocian but believed that his salary should be redistributed. Conte commented that Kocian made $165,000 a year, while each city council member made less than $10,000.[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c King-Miller, Lindsay. \"Trans City Council Member Joanne Conte Leaves Legacy of public service\".

She worked at IBM in the 1960s and is credited with the invention of generalized dynamic instruction handling, a key advance used in out-of-order execution, used by most modern computer processors to improve performance. She is also widely-known for the Mead & Conway revolution in very large scale integrated (VLSI) microchip design. That revolution spread rapidly through the research universities and computing industries during the 1980s, incubating an emerging electronic design automation industry, spawning the modern \u2018foundry\u2019 infrastructure for chip design and production, and triggering a rush of impactful high-tech startups in the 80s and 90s.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Early research at IBM\n3 Gender transition\n4 Career as computer scientist\n5 Transgender activism\n6 Personal life\n7 Awards and honors\n8 IBM's apology\n9 Selected works\n10 Patents\n11 Further reading\n12 References\n13 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nConway grew up in White Plains, New York. Conway was shy and experienced gender dysphoria as a child. She became fascinated and engaged by astronomy (building a 6-inch (150\u00a0mm) reflector telescope one summer) and did well in math and science in high school. Conway entered MIT in 1955, earning high grades but ultimately leaving in despair after an attempted gender transition in 1957\u201358 failed due to the medical climate at the time. After working as an electronics technician for several years, Conway resumed education at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science, earning B.S. and M.S.E.E. degrees in 1962 and 1963.[13][14]\n\nEarly research at IBM[edit]\nConway was recruited by IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, New York in 1964, and was soon selected to join the architecture team designing an advanced supercomputer, working alongside John Cocke, Brian Randell, Herbert Schorr, Ed Sussenguth, Fran Allen and other IBM researchers on the Advanced Computing Systems (ACS) project, inventing multiple-issue out-of-order dynamic instruction scheduling while working there.[5][7][8][9][10][11][12][15][16][17][18] The Computer History Museum has stated that \"the ACS machines appears to have been the first superscalar design, a computer architectural paradigm widely exploited in modern high-performance microprocessors.\"[7][8][9][10][11][12][17][18]\n\nGender transition[edit]\nAfter learning of the pioneering research of Harry Benjamin in treating transsexual women[19] and realising that gender affirmation surgery was now possible, Conway sought his help and became his patient. After suffering from severe depression from gender dysphoria, Conway contacted Benjamin, who agreed to provide counseling and prescribe hormones. Under Benjamin's care, Conway began her medical gender transition.[20]\nWhile struggling with life in a male role,[20] Conway had been married to a woman and had two children. Under the legal constraints then in place, she was denied access to their children after transitioning.[20]\nAlthough she had hoped to be allowed to transition on the job, IBM fired Conway in 1968 after she revealed her intention to transition.[21] IBM apologized for this in 2020.[22]\n\nCareer as computer scientist[edit]\nUpon completing her transition in 1968, Conway took a new name and identity, and restarted her career in what she called \"stealth-mode\" as a contract programmer at Computer Applications, Inc. She went on to work at Memorex during 1969\u20131972 as a digital system designer and computer architect.[20][23]\nConway joined Xerox PARC in 1973, where she led the \"LSI Systems\" group under Bert Sutherland.[24][25] When in PARC, Conway founded the \"multiproject wafers\" (MPW). This new technology made it possible to pack multiple circuit designs from various sources into one single chip. Her new invention increased production and decreased costs.[26] Collaborating with Ivan Sutherland and Carver Mead of Caltech on VLSI design methodology, she co-authored Introduction to VLSI Systems, a groundbreaking work that would soon become a standard textbook in chip design, used in nearly 120 universities by 1983.[27][28][29][30] With over 70,000 copies sold, and the new integration of her MPC79/MOSIS innovations, the Mead and Conway revolution became part of VLSI design.[28]\nIn 1978, Conway served as visiting associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, teaching a now famous VLSI design course based on a draft of the Mead\u2013Conway text.[20] The course validated the new design methods and textbook, and established the syllabus and instructor's guidebook used in later courses worldwide.[31][32]\nAmong Conway's contributions were the invention of dimensionless, scalable design rules that greatly simplified chip design and design tools,[7][8][14][33] and invention of a new form of internet-based infrastructure for rapid prototyping and short-run fabrication of large numbers of chip designs.[7][8][34] The new infrastructure was institutionalized as the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service (MOSIS) system in 1981. Two years into its success, Mead and Conway received Electronics Magazine's annual award of achievement. [35] Since then, MOSIS has fabricated more than 50,000 circuit designs for commercial firms, government agencies, and research and educational institutions around the world.[36]  VLSI researcher Charles Seitz commented that \"MOSIS represented the first period since the pioneering work of Eckert and Mauchley on the ENIAC in the late 1940s that universities and small companies had access to state-of-the-art digital technology.\"[34]\nThe research methods used to develop the Mead\u2013Conway VLSI design methodology and the MOSIS prototype are documented in a 1981 Xerox report[37] and the Euromicro Journal.[38]  The impact of the Mead\u2013Conway work is described in a number of historical overviews of computing.[34][39][40][41][42] Conway and her colleagues have compiled an online archive of original papers that documents much of that work.[43][44]\nIn the early 1980s, Conway left Xerox to join DARPA, where she was a key architect of the Defense Department's Strategic Computing Initiative, a research program studying high-performance computing, autonomous systems technology, and intelligent weapons technology.[14][45]\nIn a USA Today article about Conway's joining DARPA, Mark Stefik, a Xerox scientist who worked with her, said \"Lynn would like to live five lives in the course of one life\" and that she's \"charismatic and very energetic\".[46] Douglas Fairbairn, a former Xerox associate, said \"She figures out a way so that everybody wins.\"[46]\nAs sociologist Thomas Streeter discusses in The Net Effect:[47][48] \"By taking this job, Conway was demonstrating that she was no antiwar liberal. (In response to critics, she has said, 'if you have to fight, and sometimes you must in order to deal with bad people, history tells us that it really helps to have the best weapons available)\".[13] But Conway carried a sense of computers as tools for horizontal communications that she had absorbed at PARC right into DARPA - at one of the hottest moments of the cold war.\"\nConway joined the University of Michigan in 1985 as professor of electrical engineering and computer science, and associate dean of engineering. There she worked on \"visual communications and control probing for basic system and user-interface concepts as applicable to hybridized internet/broadband-cable communications\".[14] She retired from active teaching and research in 1998, as professor emerita at Michigan.[49]\nIn the fall of 2012, the IEEE published a special issue of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine devoted to Lynn Conway's career,[50][51] including a career memoir by Conway[21] and peer commentaries by Chuck House,[52] former Director of Engineering at HP, Carlo S\u00e9quin, Professor of EECS at U.C. Berkeley,[53] and Ken Shepard, of Columbia University.[54]\n\"Clearly a new paradigm had emerged . . . Importantly, imaginative support in terms of infrastructure and idea dissemination proved as valuable as the concepts, tools, and chips. The \"electronic book\" and the \"foundry\" were both prescient and necessary, providing momentum and proof-points.\"[52] Jim Gibbons, former dean of engineering at Stanford University, further states that Lynn Conway, from his perspective, \"...was the singular force behind the entire \"foundry\" development that emerged.\"[52] Kenneth Shepard, Professor of Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, stated that \"Lynn's amazing story of accomplishment and personal triumph in the face of personal adversity and overt discrimination should serve as an inspiration to all young engineers.\"[54][55]\n\nTransgender activism[edit]\nWhen nearing retirement, Conway learned that the story of her early work at IBM might soon be revealed through the investigations of Mark Smotherman that were being prepared for a 2001 publication.[5] She began quietly coming out as a trans woman in 1999 to friends and colleagues about her past gender transition,[56][57][58] using her personal website to tell the story in her own words.[13] Her story was then more widely reported in 2000 in profiles in Scientific American[15] and the Los Angeles Times.[20]\nAfter going public with her story, she began work in transgender activism, intending to \"illuminate and normalize the issues of gender identity and the processes of gender transition\".[59] She has worked to protect and expand the rights of transgender people. She has provided direct and indirect assistance to numerous other transgender women going through transition and maintains a well-known website providing medical resources and emotional advice. Parts have been translated into most of the world's major languages.[60] She maintains a listing of many successful post-transition transgender people, to, in her words \"provide role models for individuals who are facing gender transition\".[61] Her website also provides current news related to transgender issues and information on sex reassignment surgery for transsexual women, facial feminization surgery, academic inquiries into the prevalence of transsexualism[62] and transgender and transsexual issues in general.[63][64]\nShe has also strongly advocated for equal opportunities and employment protections for transgender people in high-technology industry,[6][65][66][67][68][69] for elimination of the pathologization of transgender people by the psychiatric community.[70][71]\nConway has been a prominent critic of the Blanchard, Bailey, and Lawrence theory of male-to-female transsexualism that trans women are motivated either by feminine homosexuality or autogynephilia.[72]  She was also a key person in the campaign against J. Michael Bailey's book The Man Who Would Be Queen,[73] which was published, and publicized as the latest science on transsexualism by the National Academy Press of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.[74] Conway and University of Chicago economics professor Dierdre McCloskey wrote letters to Northwestern University, accusing Bailey of \"conducting intimate research observations on human subjects without telling them that they were objects of the study.\"[72]  American bioethicist Alice Dreger in her book Galilieo's Middle Finger criticized Conway for filing a lawsuit against Bailey which had \"no legal basis,\" referring to her allegation that Bailey lacked a license as a clinical psychologist when he wrote letters in support of a young trans woman seeking to transition. According to Dreger, as Bailey did not receive compensation for his services, he would not have needed a license in Illinois, and was \"completely forthright in his letters supporting the women, both about the fact that he had only had brief conversations with them (as opposed to having provided them with extensive counseling) and about his own qualifications and expertise...[and] even attached copies of his CV.\" As Dreger argues, \"presumably all this was why [Illinois] never bothered to pursue the charge.\"[75]  In response, Conway argued that Dreger \"deflects attention away from Bailey's book and the massive trans community protest, and caricatures the entire controversy as nothing more than a vicious effort by three rather witch-like women to 'ruin the life' of a brilliant scientist. In doing so, she stoops to new lows as a dirty-trickster by misquoting sources, exploiting sleazy innuendos and fabricating entire story-episodes in order to defame the three women.\"[76]\nConway was a cast member in the first all-transgender performance of The Vagina Monologues in Los Angeles in 2004,[77] and appeared in a LOGO-Channel documentary film about that event entitled Beautiful Daughters.[56][78]\nIn 2009, Conway was named one of the \"Stonewall 40 trans heroes\" on the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots by the International Court System, one of the oldest and largest predominantly gay organizations in the world, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.[79][80]\nIn 2013, with support from many prominent thought-leaders in high-technology, Conway and her colleague Leandra Vicci of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill successfully lobbied the Board of Directors of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for transgender inclusion in the IEEE's Code of Ethics.[81]  That Code, known within the profession as much as a code of honor as one of ethics, became fully LGBT inclusive in January 2014, thus impacting the world's largest engineering professional society, with 425,000 members in 160 countries.[82][83][84] In 2014, Time Magazine named Lynn as one of \"21 Transgender People Who Influenced American Culture.\"[4] In 2015 she was selected for inclusion in \"The Trans100\".[85]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1987, Conway met her husband Charles \"Charlie\" Rogers, a professional engineer who shares her interest in the outdoors, including whitewater canoeing and motocross racing.[20][86]  They soon started living together, and bought a house with 24 acres (97,000\u00a0m2) of meadow, marsh, and woodland in rural Michigan in 1994.[20]  On August 13, 2002, they were married.[16][56] In 2014, the University of Michigan's The Michigan Engineer alumni magazine documented the connections between Conway's engineering explorations and the adventures in her personal life.[87][88]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nConway has received a number of awards and distinctions:\n\nElectronics 1981 Award for Achievement[89]\nHarold Pender Award of the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 1984[90]\nIEEE EAB Major Educational Innovation Award, 1984[91]\nFellow of the IEEE, 1985, \"for contributions to VLSI technology\"[92]\nJohn Price Wetherill Medal of the Franklin Institute, 1985[93]\nSecretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Award, May 1985[49][94]\nMember of the National Academy of Engineering, 1989[95]\nNational Achievement Award, Society of Women Engineers, 1990[96]\nPresidential Appointment to the United States Air Force Academy Board of Visitors, 1996[97]\nHonorary Doctorate, Trinity College, 1998[98]\nElectronic Design Hall of Fame, 2002[99]\nEngineer of the Year, National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals, 2005[100]\nNamed one of the \"Stonewall 40 trans heroes\" by the ICS and NGLTF, 2009.[79][80]\nComputer Pioneer Award, IEEE Computer Society, 2009[7][8]\nMember of the Corporation, Emerita, The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, 1993-2010[101]\nFellow Award, Computer History Museum, 2014, \"For her work in developing and disseminating new methods of integrated circuit design.\" [102][103][104][105][106][107]\nHonorary Doctorate, Illinois Institute of Technology, 2014[108]\nSteinmetz Memorial Lecture, (Invitational), IEEE/Union College, 2015.[109][110][111][112][113]\nIEEE/RSE James Clerk Maxwell Medal, 2015[114][115][116][117][118][119][120][121]\nMagill Lecture in Science, Technology and the Arts (Invited), Columbia University, 2016[122][123]\nHonorary Doctorate, University of Victoria, 2016[124][125][126][127][128]\nFellow Award, American Association for the Advance of Science (AAAS), 2016[129][130][131][132]\nHonorary Doctorate and Commencement Address, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2018[133][134][135][136]\nLifetime Achievement Award, IBM Corporation, 2020[137]\nIBM's apology[edit]\nIn 2020, 52 years after IBM fired her for being transgender, IBM officially and publicly apologized to Conway[138][139][140][141][142][143]; IBM held a public event \"Tech Trailblazer and Transgender Pioneer Lynn Conway in conversation with Diane Gherson\" (IBM's senior VP of HR);  IBM's Director of Research Dario Gil said \"Lynn was recently awarded the rare IBM Lifetime Achievement Award, given to individuals who have changed the world through technology inventions.

She went on to become rock's first openly transgender singer, and adopted the stage name Jayne County.\nCounty's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of her career, including glam punk, punk rock, blues rock, and boogie-woogie.[1] County did not think her birth name Wayne Rogers \"sounded very glamorous\" and decided to adopt the name of the county in which Detroit was located because she admired bands from that city \"like Iggy [Pop] and all those people.\"[2] Though she has never been a commercial success, she has been an influence on a number of musicians including David Bowie, the Ramones, Patti Smith, Pete Burns and Lou Reed,[3] and many of County's songs have become well-known, including \"Man Enough to Be a Woman\", \"Fuck Off\", \"Stuck on You,\" and \"Night Time\". Pianist Jools Holland's first studio outing was with County on her single \"Fuck Off\". She also appeared as an actress at Andy Warhol's Factory and had a brief association with David Bowie during the 1970s. County played 'Lounge Lizard\" in the first punk rock film, Derek Jarman's Jubilee, and the band performed \"Paranoia Paradise\",[4] which also appeared on the Jubilee Soundtrack album, released by Polydor UK in 1978. Wayne County and the Electric Chairs were supported by The Police during their 1977 tour of Holland,[5] later recruiting Police guitarist Henry Padovani on rhythm guitar.[6]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early years\n2 Career\n\n2.1 1970\u20131979\n2.2 1980\u2013present\n\n\n3 Works\n\n3.1 Filmography\n3.2 Discography\n3.3 Biography\n\n\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly years[edit]\nBorn in 1947, County left her hometown of Dallas, Georgia, in 1968 at 19 years old to move to[7] New York City, where she became a regular at the Stonewall Inn and took part in the historic riots.[8] In 1969 County was asked by Warhol superstar and playwright Jackie Curtis to appear in her play, Femme Fatale. The play had a successful run at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and also starred Patti Smith. In her autobiography, County says of Curtis, \"She was my biggest influence, the person who really got me started.\"[9]\n\nCareer[edit]\n1970\u20131979[edit]\nAfter appearing in Femme Fatale, County wrote the play World \u2013 Birth of a Nation (The Castration of Man). The play was directed by Tony Ingrassia and promoted as a \"homosexual fantasy.\" The play was set in a hospital and related to castration of the male sex. County played both Florence Nitingale and her sister Ethel Nitingale, and the play also featured Cherry Vanilla who played a nurse named Tilly Tons.[10]\nAfter seeing County in the play, Warhol cast her in his own theatrical production of Pork, which was also adapted and directed by Tony Ingrassia.[11] After a run in New York, the play was performed in London with the same New York cast. Upon returning to New York, County appeared in another play, Island by Tony Ingrassia, again with Patti Smith.[12]\nIn 1972 County formed Queen Elizabeth, one of the pioneering proto-punk bands. County was signed to MainMan Artistes, David Bowie's management firm, but no records were ever produced. The company spent over $200,000 to film the 1974 stage show, \"Wayne at the Trucks\", but footage has never been released. The show featured numerous costume changes and some of County's raunchiest material. Eight songs from the show were released on the 2006 album, \"Wayne County At the Trucks\", on Munster Records. County claims the show was the inspiration for Bowie's Diamond Dogs tour.[13] In particular, County maintains that the song \"Queenage Baby\" was a prototype for Bowie's song \"Rebel Rebel\", a claim which is supported by some rock critics.[14][15]\nIn 1974 County formed Wayne County and the Backstreet Boys, which recorded three tracks for Max's Kansas City: New York New Wave, a compilation that also featured Suicide, Pere Ubu, Cherry Vanilla and The Fast. Wayne County and The Backstreet Boys played regularly at CBGB and Max's Kansas City, where County was also a DJ. In 1976, she appeared in the film The Blank Generation, directed by Amos Poe and Ivan Kral. The film, the recording and the shows were the beginnings of what came to be known as punk rock, and helped define the movement.[16]\nIn 1977 County moved to London, where the English punk scene was just emerging, and formed Wayne County & the Electric Chairs. County released the EP Electric Chairs 1977, plus a single on Illegal Records. This was followed by \"Fuck Off\", recorded as a single for Safari Records and supported with a European tour. While in London, County met Derek Jarman, who cast her as \"Lounge Lizard\" in the seminal punk film Jubilee, which also starred Adam Ant, Toyah Willcox, Ian Charleson, Little Nell and Jordan.[17] County and band are also featured in The Punk Rock Movie, by Don Letts, containing part of a 1977 performance at The Roxy club in London.\nIn 1978, the Wayne County song \"Fucked by the Devil,\" was recorded by Jimi LaLumia and The Psychotic Frogs. The song was released on Jimi LaLumia and The Psychotic Frogs' EP Typically Tasteless. It was a vinyl EP that instantly sold 10,000 copies. Later on Jimi LaLumia would work with Wayne County in a managerial position.[18]\nShortly after this, Wayne County and The Electric Chairs recorded their first, eponymous album, as well as another EP, \"Blatantly Offensive\", which contained \"Fuck Off\" and \"Toilet Love.\" After their touring in support of these releases was done, they recorded \"Storm the Gates of Heaven\". Their next album, released in 1979, was \"Things Your Mother Never Told You\", which featured several songs based on County's experiences in Germany. The album was produced by David Cunningham.[19] After it was released, the band broke up and County, along with guitarist Eliot Michaels, returned to the U.S.\nWhen County moved to Berlin in 1979, she changed her stage name to \"Jayne County\",[20] publicly identifying as a woman for the first time. County's 1980 release of \"Rock and Roll Resurrection\" (In Concert) on Attic Records was under this new name. With Elliot Michaels on guitar, Peter Jordan on bass and Sammy Minelli on drums the first live show under County's new name in Toronto Canada, sparked erroneous rumours of a sex change operation.[17]\n\n1980\u2013present[edit]\nIn 1983 County returned to New York where she appeared in the theatrical production Les Girls with Holly Woodlawn. Shortly thereafter she returned to London for the premi\u00e8re of the German film City of Lost Souls, released on 5 February '83 in which she played Leila and staying long enough to record and tour another album. Warren Heighway befriended Jayne in Manchester and became her UK manager. He put a band together to record Jayne's debut studio album \"Private Oyster\". The band members came from various rock bands from the Manchester area. Guitarists Stu Clarke and Chris Lynch, bassist Mark Pearson and drummer Bazz Creece. The album was recorded at Pennine Studios in Oldham and released on Revolver Records in 1986.[21] 1989 saw Jayne release the mini album \"Betty Grables Legs\" and the single \"Time Machine\" on Jungle Records, recorded at Station House Studios New Brighton with Mark Pearson on bass, Paul Wainwright on guitar and Kevin O'Brien on drums. Following widespread media attention, she returned to the U.S., where her manager for America, Jimi LaLumia, secured the release of the album \"Goddess Of Wet Dreams\" on the ESP DISK label; this became County's first U.S. release.Lalumia then secured a deal for County with the NY based label Royalty Records; Royalty released the UK based County compilation \"Rock & Roll Cleopatra\", and the subsequent studio album, \"Deviation\"; Royalty launched County's first and only major U.S. tour in support of the releases.\nFrom 1990 onwards many of County's earlier recordings were re-released, including the early Safari tracks, on a CD called \"Rock & Roll Cleopatra\". She recorded the album \"Goddess of Wet Dreams\" at Twilight Studios in Salford Manchester in 1993, followed by \"Deviation\" recorded at The Cutting Rooms in Crumpsall Manchester in 1994. Later that year, she appeared in Wigstock: The Movie and released her autobiography, \"Man Enough to Be a Woman\" on Serpent's Tail (press to read[9] )From 1989 to 1997, Jayne County & The Electric Chairs consisted of Jayne on vocals, Mark Pearson on bass, Paul Wainwright on guitar, and Colin Rocks on drums. This lineup recorded and toured the UK and Europe during this time still with Warren Heighway acting as agent and Manchester Management for Trace Element Corporation. Warren Heighway passed away on 7/8/'05.\nSince that time several new tracks have surfaced on various compilations and through County's official website. Many of these tracks, both live and studio recordings, were collected on the Ratcage Records release So New York, including collaborations with Lisa Jackson and former Electric Chairs guitarist Eliot Michaels. A live show, recorded on County's birthday, was released on the 2002 CD Wash Me in the Blood (of Rock & Roll)- Live at Squeeze Box by Fang Records.[22] The CD features a duet on \"California Sun\" by County and former nemesis \"Handsome\" Dick Manitoba of The Dictators. In 2005  \"Man Enough To Be A Woman\" a Live DVD was released on Cherry Red Films recorded at Blackpool Winter Gardens on 11/8/'96 with Mark Pearson on bass, Paul Wainwright on guitar and Colin Rocks on drums. \nAfter leaving New York City, County settled in the Atlanta area where she has a band called the Electrick Queers with guitarist Jet Terror, bassist Gary Yoxen, and drummer Rob Kirkland. In 2014 Safari Records released a CD/DVD of Wayne County and The Electric Chairs, Live at Rockpalast Germany from 1978.[23] On July 22, 2015, Jayne County & the Electrick Queers headlined ARMageddon, to benefit Blast-Off Burlesque's Trey Chic.[24]\nOn 23 September 2017, County released a five-track extended play download by Jayne County and The JC5 entitled \"Here Come The JC5\".[25]\nIn 2018, County debuted a retrospective show of visual art at Participant, Inc, a gallery in New York City.[26] Comprising five decades of work, Paranoia Paradise included paintings, drawings, collages, and photography.[27]\n\nWorks[edit]\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nDirector(s)\n\n\n1975\n\nNight Lunch\n\nIvan Kral and Amos Poe\n\n\n1976\n\nThe Blank Generation\n\nIvan Kral and Amos Poe\n\n\n1977\n\nPunk in London\n\nWolfgang B\u00fcld\n\n\n1977\n\nThe Punk Rock Movie\n\nDon Letts\n\n\n1978\n\nJubilee\n\nDerek Jarman\n\n\n1982\n\nStadt der verlorenen Seelen (City of Lost Souls)\n\nRosa von Praunheim\n\n\n1995\n\nWigstock: The Movie\n\nBarry Shils\n\n\n1999\n\nBorn to Lose: The Last Rock and Roll Movie\n\nLech Kowalski\n\n\n2001\n\nFreaks, Glam Gods and Rock Stars\n\nTim Ryan\n\n\n2003\n\nEnd of the Century\n\nJim Fields and Michael Gramaglia\n\n\n2007\n\nKing of Punk\n\nKenneth van Schooten\n\n\n2008\n\nSqueezebox!\n\nSteven Saporito and Zach Shaffer\n\n\n2009\n\nBurning Down the House: The Story of CBGB\n\nMandy Stein\n\n\n2010\n\nBeautiful Darling\n\nJames Rasin\n\n\n2012\n\nJobriath A.D.\n\nKieran Turner\n\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAlbums\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nLabel\n\n\n1978\nThe Electric Chairs\nSafari\n\n\n1978\nStorm the Gates of Heaven\nSafari\n\n\n1979\nThings Your Mother Never Told You\nSafari\n\n\n1980\nRock and Roll Resurrection (In Concert)\nSafari/Attic Records Li\n\n\n1982\nBest Of Jayne/Wayne County And The Electric Chairs\nSafari\n\n\n1986\nPrivate Oyster\nRevolver\n\n\n1989\nBetty Grable's Legs\nJungle\n\n\n1993\nGoddess of Wet Dreams\nESP\n\n\n1995\nDeviation\nRoyalty\n\n\n2002\nWash Me in the Blood (of Rock & Roll)- Live at Squeeze Box\nFang\n\n\n2003\nSo New York\nRatcage\n\n\n2006\nWayne County at the Trucks\nMunster\n\n\n2016\nGoddess Of Wet Dreams-The Legacy Edition\nMVD\n\n\n2016\nAmerikan Cleopatra/Private Oyster-The Legacy Edition\nMVD\n\nExtended plays\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nLabel\n\n\n1976\nMax's Kansas City 1976\nRam Stereo 1213\n\n\n1977\nThe Electric Chairs\nIllegal\n\n\n1978\nBlatantly Offensive\nSafari\n\n\n2017\nHere Come The JC5\nAdrastea Music\n\nSingles\n\"Twist and Shout\"/\"Boys\" with Jimi LaLumia & The Psychotic Frogs/also featuring Johnny Thunders and Cherry Vanilla-Beat This Label-1981\n\"Razor Clam\", (with She Wolves), Poptown Records 2007\n\"California Uber Alles\", (with She Wolves), Poptown Records 2007\n\"Hail Satan!\", (with Sharon Needles), Independent 2013\n\"Leave My Pu**y Alone\", (with Jimi LaLumia), LaLumia Tunes 2017\n\"IGenderTy\",LaLumia Tunes 2018\nBiography[edit]\nCounty, Jayne; Rupert Smith (1996).

During the Second World War, he again served in the army and was the Director of Medical Services for Allied forces in North Africa from 1942 to 1944.[4] In 1944, he was made honorary surgeon to King George VI.[5] Post-war, he was Public Medical Officer for the Allied High Commission (the Allied body that governed occupied Germany after the war).\nRoberta Cowell attended Whitgift School, a boys' public school in Croydon and was an enthusiastic member of the school's Motor Club, along with John Cunningham, who would later be famous as an RAF night fighter ace and test pilot.[Note 1] Towards the end of her school days, she visited Belgium, Germany, and Austria with a school friend. At the time, one of her hobbies was photography and film making, and she was briefly arrested in Germany for shooting a cine film of a group of Nazis drilling. She secured her release by agreeing to destroy the film, but was able to substitute unused film stock, and keep the original footage.[6]\nCowell left school at the age of 16 to join General Aircraft Limited as an apprentice aircraft engineer, but soon left to join the Royal Air Force, becoming an acting pilot officer on probation on 4 August 1936;[7] Cowell began pilot-training, but was discharged because of air-sickness.[8]\nIn 1936, Cowell began studying engineering at University College London. Also in that year, she began motor-racing, winning her class at the Land's End Speed Trial in a Riley.[9] She gained initial experience of the sport by sneaking into the area where cars were serviced at the Brooklands racing circuit, wearing mechanic's overalls, and offering help to any driver or mechanic who wanted it.[6] By 1939, she owned three cars and had competed in the 1939 Antwerp Grand Prix.[6]\n\nSecond World War[edit]\n A preserved, photo-reconnaissance Spitfire PR. XI (2008)\n Hawker Typhoon FR IB, number EK427; this aircraft was flown by 4 Squadron (March 1945)\nOn 28 December 1940, Cowell was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps as second lieutenant,[10] and in June 1941, married Diana Margaret Zelma Carpenter[11] (1917\u20132006),[12] who also had been an engineering student at UCL with an interest in motor racing.[Note 2] Cowell served in Iceland[Note 3] before transferring from the Army to the RAF on 24 January 1942 with the rank of pilot officer (temporary).[13] She had obtained a private pilot's licence before the war[6] and completed RAF flying training at RAF Ansty.[11]\nCowell served a tour with a front\u2013line Spitfire squadron[Note 4] and then briefly as an instructor. By June 1944, she was flying with No. 4 Squadron RAF, a squadron assigned to the task of aerial reconnaissance. During the course of the war the squadron had flown a variety of aircraft types but by mid\u20131944 it was flying the Spitfire PR. XI,[14] an unarmed, camera-equipped version of the Supermarine Spitfire. Shortly before the D-Day landings, on 4 June 1944, she had a lucky escape when the oxygen system of her Spitfire malfunctioned at 31,000 feet (9,400\u00a0m) over Fruges, France. She passed out but the aircraft continued flying on its own for around an hour over German\u2013occupied France while being subjected to German anti-aircraft fire, she regained semi-consciousness at low altitude and was able to fly back to the squadron's base at RAF Gatwick.[14][15]\nBy October 1944, 4 Squadron was based at Deurne, Belgium, on the outskirts of Antwerp.[16] and its Spitfires were supplemented by an allocation of Hawker Typhoon FR IBs, a photo-reconnaissance version of the Hawker Typhoon fighter-bomber.[Note 5] On 18 November 1944, Cowell was piloting one of a pair of Typhoons[Note 6] on a low-level sortie near Bocholt, Germany.[17] South east of Kessel, Cowell attacked targets on the ground, but her aircraft's engine was knocked out and its wing holed by German anti-aircraft fire. Cowell was flying too low to bail-out and instead jettisoned the cockpit canopy and glided her Typhoon to a successful deadstick crash-landing. She was able to contact her companion by radio and confirm she was unhurt before being captured by German troops.[16] Cowell made two escape attempts, reasoning that the chances of success were greatest if the attempt was made quickly, while still close to the front\u2013line.[18] However, the attempts failed and she was taken further into Germany, spending several weeks in solitary confinement at an interrogation centre for captured Allied aircrew,[18] before being moved to the prisoner\u2013of\u2013war camp Stalag Luft I.[18][19]\nCowell remained a prisoner for around five months, occupying the time by teaching classes in automotive-engineering to fellow inmates.[18] In her biography, she describes the situational sexual behaviour shown by some of the camp's Allied prisoners, and her discomfort at being propositioned by prisoners who assumed she also wanted to take part in this. She was offered the part of a woman in a camp theatrical production but turned it down, as she thought this would make her appear homosexual in the eyes of other prisoners.[18] Towards the end of the war, food became short at the camp; Cowell lost 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) in weight, and later described killing the camp's cats and eating them raw because of hunger.[20]\nBy April 1945, the advancing Red Army was approaching. The initial German intention was to evacuate the camp, but the prisoners refused to leave. After negotiations between the Senior American Officer and the Kommandant, the Germans guarding Stalag Luft I abandoned it and evacuated towards the west, leaving the prisoners behind. The unguarded and undefended camp was reached by the Red Army on the night of 30 April 1945. Commonwealth personnel were flown back to the United Kingdom some two weeks later, between 12 and 14 May, by aircraft of the United States Army Air Forces.[21][22][Note 7]\n\nPostwar life[edit]\nAfter demobilization, Cowell was engaged in a number of business ventures until, in 1946, she founded a motor-racing team and competed in events across Europe, including the Brighton Speed Trials and the Grand Prix at Rouen-Les-Essarts.[9]\nHowever her autobiography describes this as a time of great distress. She also experienced traumatic flashback when watching the film Mine Own Executioner, in which the hero is shot-down by anti-aircraft fire while flying a Spitfire.[23]\nIn 1948, Cowell separated from her wife and, suffering from depression, she sought out a leading Freudian psychiatrist of the time, but was unsatisfied by the help he offered.[23] Sessions with a second Freudian psychiatrist, described in her biography only as a Scottish man with a less orthodox approach to his profession, gradually revealed, in her own words, that her \"unconscious mind was predominantly female\" and \"feminine side of my nature, which all my life I had known of and severely repressed, was very much more fundamental and deep-rooted than I had supposed.\"[23]\n\nTransition and surgery[edit]\nBy 1950, Cowell was taking large doses of oestrogen, but was still living as a man.[24] She had become acquainted with Michael Dillon, a British physician who was the first trans man to get a phalloplasty, after reading his 1946 volume Self: A Study in Endocrinology and Ethics. This work proposed that individuals should have the right to change gender, to have the kind of body they desired.[24] The two developed a close friendship. Dillon subsequently carried out an inguinal orchiectomy on Cowell. Secrecy was necessary for this as the procedure was then illegal in the United Kingdom under so-called \"mayhem\" laws and no surgeon would agree to perform it openly.[8]\nCowell then presented herself to a private Harley Street gynaecologist and was able to obtain from him a document stating she was intersex. This allowed her to have a new birth certificate issued, with her recorded sex changed to female.[25] She had a vaginoplasty on 15 May 1951. The operation was carried out by Sir Harold Gillies, widely considered the father of plastic surgery,[26] with the assistance of American surgeon Ralph Millard. Gillies had operated on Michael Dillon, but vaginoplasty was then an entirely novel procedure, which Gillies had only performed experimentally on a cadaver.[citation needed]\n\nLater life[edit]\nBy 1954, her two business ventures, a racing car engineering company (Leacroft of Egham) and a clothing company had both ceased trading and her change of legal gender had made it impossible for her to continue Grand Prix motor racing.[27] However, in March 1954, news of her gender reassignment broke, gaining public interest around the world. In the United Kingdom, her story was published in the magazine Picture Post, and Cowell received a fee of around \u00a38000 from the magazine (equivalent to \u00a3220,000 in 2019, when adjusted for inflation).[28] Cowell's biography was published soon after this, earning a further \u00a31500 (\u00a341,400 in 2019).\nIn the United States, the widespread sensation caused by the news stories about Christine Jorgensen in 1952 had introduced the American public to the concept of changing sex, and the press had continued to print a steady stream of stories about others who had done so, mostly male to female trans women.[29] Such reports tended to conflate the unrelated concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, so transsexuality had become closely associated in the public mind with male homosexuality (during this period, highly taboo) and effeminacy amongst men. Cowell's story consequently appeared confusing as it disrupted this narrative. Her marriage, her parenting of children, her wartime combat service and her association with motor racing were, during this period, perceived as strong markers of heterosexual masculinity; these aspects of her life were described repeatedly in press reports.[30]\nShe continued to be active in motor racing and attracted some publicity for winning the 1957 Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb. In November 1958, she acquired an ex-RAF de Havilland Mosquito (number TK-655, civil registration G-AOSS).[31] Her intention was to use the aircraft for a record-breaking flight over the South Atlantic.[32] However, the project fell through due to a lack of suitable engines[32] and in 1958 she became bankrupt[33] with debts totaling \u00a312,580 (approximately \u00a3296,100 in 2019).[27] By 1959, G-AOSS was a derelict hulk[34] and its remains were scrapped in 1960.[32]\nHer financial difficulties continued, as she found it difficult to get employment.[35] In later years, she largely dropped out of the public eye. However she was still an active figure in British motor racing in the 1970s.[9] She also continued flying and by this time had logged over 1600 hours as a pilot.[36]\nA brief interview with Sunday Times journalist Michael Bateman appeared in March 1972, when she was working on an (unpublished) second biography.[36] In the interview, she stated she was an intersex individual with the chromosomal abnormality XX male syndrome, and that the condition justified her transition.[Note 8] She also spoke in derogatory terms of those individuals with XY chromosomes who also underwent male to female gender reassignment, saying \"The people who have followed me have often been those with male chromosomes, XY. So they've been normal people who've turned themselves into freaks by means of the operation.\"[36]\nIn the 1990s, Cowell moved into sheltered accommodation in Hampton, London although she continued to own and drive large, powerful cars. She died on 11 October 2011. Her funeral was attended by only six people and (on her instructions) was unpublicised \u2013 her death was not publicly reported until two years later, when a profile of her was printed in The Independent newspaper in October 2013.[2] The New York Times published Cowell's obituary on 5 June 2020.[8]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nTransgender portal\nList of transgender people\nList of transgender-related topics\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Her autobiography does not name her school, but states Cunningham was a fellow pupil.

Unlike the Spitfire, it was armed \u2013 one of the Typhoon's four cannon was removed and three F24 cameras were fitted in its place, one pointing forwards and two down. However, although the Typhoon was well regarded as a combat aircraft, the reconnaissance version was unpopular with pilots and unsatisfactory in this role \u2013 inherent engine and airframe vibrations invariably blurred the photographs.\n\n^ She was flying Typhoon number EK429,see: Franks (2000). The other aircraft was flown by Flt. Lt. Draper.\n\n^ Known as Operation Revival, the repatriation of prisoners used American transport aircraft for the sick and wounded, and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers for the healthy. Wooden floor\u2013boards were installed in the B\u201317s' bomb-bays, to make an extemporized passenger compartment and as many as 30 men were crammed into each bomber. Commonwealth ex-prisoners were flown to the United Kingdom, American ex-prisoners were flown to Camp Lucky Strike near Le Havre, France, for return to the United States by sea. The Western Allies were anxious to quickly remove their personnel from areas under Soviet control, for fear they might be used as hostages. See: Howland (2004)\n\n^ XX-male syndrome is sometimes known as de la Chapelle syndrome, for the Finnish researcher who characterized it in, 1972; see de la Chapelle (1972). Those with this condition have a female genotype, but are usually typical boys or men. However, it must be noted that Roberta Cowell stated in her biography she had two children, in July 1942 and August 1944 (see Cowell (1952), chapter 4), and individuals with XX-male syndrome are sterile, due to Azoospermia. Often, they only become aware of their condition when being evaluated for infertility.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\nCitations\n\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Roberta Cowell's Birth Certificate\".

Heat productions, CoxXx (under the name Stonie) signed an exclusive contract with GayVN Hall of Fame director Paul Barresi.[4][11]  The contract was unusual for including benefits rarely provided in the adult industry.[4]  By 2006, her career had included more than 60 productions and involved every major gay porn studio.[3]  Accolades included being described as the Kate Moss of gay porn[12] and \"the boy with the hottest ass\"[3] \u2013 in fact, Mickey Skee described the star as having \"one of the hottest asses in the business since Joey Stefano's\"[13] whilst Jason Sechrest described the star as an \"insatiable super bottom with an unparalleled sex drive\".[1]\nCoxXx's work often included \"dictatorial daddies\"[12] and authoritarian, discipline, or military themes. In playing roles subservient to \"dictatorial daddies\", CoxXx was well-matched with Barresi, as Adult Video News has said Barresi's directorial efforts make him \"undisputedly the king of military-themed videos.\"[14] Many of the authoritarian videos were made with Barresi and his Regiment Productions studio (such as Brig Brats,[15] Carnal Cadets,[16] and Wild Blue[17]), though a spanking fetish video was also filmed with Control-T Studios[18] and a bondage video Roped Trick with Tom \"Ropes\" McGurk.[19]\nCoxXx appeared in a scene with J.T. Sloan, the 1995 GayVN Gay Performer of the Year, in the 2000 Pacific Sun Entertainment production Daddy Please![20]  Working with All Worlds Video, she made White Lies,[21] Father Figure,[22] appearing with GayVN Award and two-time Grabby Award-winner Sam Crockett. CoxXx was also featured in the film's sequel, Father Figure 2.[23] For Catalina Video, she appeared in a threeway with Jason Sizemore.[24] The two also appeared together in the Studio 2000 production Straight Up.[25] CoxXx's career included appearances on nearly 50 box covers.[1]\nA nomination was received in the \"Best Newcomer\" category in the 2001 GayVN Awards,[1] losing to Caesar. The two stars appeared together in the Men of Odyssey production Caesar's Hardhat Gang Bang, which won the 2001 GayVN Award for \"Best Ethnic-Themed Video\".[4][26]\n\nBorat cameo[edit]\nBorat was a 2006 mockumentary comedy film that was a critical and commercial success, but which was also highly controversial. In what was described as one of the best sight gags in the film,[27] the central character Borat Sagdiyev shows photographs of himself with his allegedly 13-year-old son Hooeylewis, portrayed by CoxXx,[3][6][7][8] to an etiquette coach.[28] In one such photo, Hooeylewis naked and \"cradling his Dad in his arms\" while in another \"Borat [is] squatting down giving the thumbs-up sign to a close-up of shot of his son's large endowment\".[29]\nRadarOnline republished the Radar magazine report on the porn star appearing as Borat's son:[6]\n\nBorat's producers first contacted [Stonie's Manager, David Forest] in June 2005, he tells Radar. \"They wanted to find someone who would look 13 or 14 but was actually of legal age and would do frontal nudity,\" he recalls. Cortez immediately sprang to mind, he says, because \"he's a small-framed boy but has a large organ.\"\nCommenting on the appearance, Queerty noted that, despite Borat exploiting \"his son's genitals\",[30] Sacha Baron Cohen did not invite CoxXx to the premiere of Borat. Forest did comment that the star \"earned far more for [the Borat] photo session than [she] would've if it had been for an adult company. We got paid a good sum of money.\"[31]\n\nTransition[edit]\n Brittany CoxXx, after her transition\nCoxXx's last gay porn appearances were filmed in 2005,[3] though these works continued to be released until 2006.[27] Her transition began in late 2005[4] and lasted approximately a year, after which she took the stage name Brittany CoxXx.[7] At the start of 2008, agent David Forest[32] confirmed her return to adult film productions, her first performance being in Brittany's Transformation in collaboration with Barresi,[33] who she trusted and respected after their earlier work together.[4][27]  CoxXx declared that she was \"really looking forward to working again with Pleasure Productions and Paul Barresi,\" adding that \"[i]t's funny how things happen in life. Everything seems to come full circle.\"[34]\nThe film Brittany's Transformation told the story of her transitioning and was well received. Barresi put together the financing for the film and chose to include older footage of Stonie to tell her transition story. Barresi described the film as unlike any transsexual movie made before.[35] The film was nominated in the 2009 AVN Awards in the category of \"Best Transsexual Release\", while CoxXx herself was nominated in the \"Transsexual Performer Of The Year\" category.[36][37] Speaking about Brittany's Transformation, CoxXx commented that \"since this is my first movie as a woman \u2013 in my new bod, which I totally love by the way \u2013 it's a whole new experience onscreen for myself and for the viewers\".[38] She was partnered with Christian XXX in the final scene of the film.\nJ. C. Adams commented that CoxXx's transsexual performance \"may actually be the first time a gay adult performer has undergone the switch and re-emerged as a MTF actor. (Others have donned drag, of course, but that's a different animal.)\"[27] Jason Sechrest claimed that CoxXx was the first to move from gay male to trans woman porn star, describing the movie as \"groundbreaking\",[1] although adult trans-actress Stasha in fact did that already in the early 90s, gaining attention after previously having performed in gay porn under the names Angelo and Steven Moore before transitioning to Stasha. Lucas Entertainment performer Christina Cruz has since followed Brittany by also transitioning from the gay male market to the transsexual market.[39] According to Gay Porn Times editor J. C. Adams, the report of CoxXx's transition[27] was in the top ten most popular stories they covered in 2008.[40] \u00a0Chi Chi LaRue commented on the difficulties CoxXx faced, observing that \"she was happier once she transitioned\" but also that many \"people didn't show her support or respect her decision.\"[34]\n\nPost-acting and death[edit]\nCoxXx left the adult industry in 2009 and moved to Florida,[4] where she spent several months in hospital battling Hepatitis B and liver disease.[41] By January 2010, her hepatitis was reported to be almost undetectable and she was recovering well.[42] By September, CoxXx was reported as fully recovered and made a live appearance at Micky's in West Hollywood, California,[43] stealing the show.[44]  CoxXx subsequently started a business in Fort Lauderdale, Florida \u2013 Couture Visions Photography \u2013 which she owned and operated until her death.[4][45]\nCoxXx died at Broward Health in Fort Lauderdale on December 6, 2016 at the age of 38. She was survived by her father, two of her brothers, and her paternal grandmother.[9][34]  CoxXx was remembered fondly by adult industry figures. Chi Chi Larue described CoxXx as a \"true original\"[4] who was \"very beautiful in both of his and her lives\"[34] and \"grabbed the bull by the horns and did it his way. She will definitely be missed. Rest in peace sweet angel.\"[4]  The JRL Charts President reflected on McKay introducing him to Stonie, who he described as an \"upbeat young man who had high hopes for a career in the gay adult film industry [who] became a true friend for many years.  ...  I will truly miss her.\"[4]\n\nVideography[edit]\nGay pornographic video appearances as Stonie include:[2][46]\n\nThe Big Tease \u2013 Stonie Learns a Lesson (1999, director: Steve Powers, studio: Control-T Studios)[18]\nRoped Trick (1999, director: Tom \"Ropes\" McGurk, studio: Grapik Art Productions)[19][47]\nCaesar's Hardhat Gang Bang (2000, director: Chi Chi LaRue, studio: Men of Odyssey), won the 2001 GayVN Award for \"Best Ethnic-Themed Video\"[26]\nDaddy Please!

She spent time at the Stonewall Inn during the era of the Stonewall riots, as she was dating one of the club's doormen. In 1970, one year after the Stonewall uprising, Cruz took part in the first Gay Pride march, then called the Christopher Street Liberation Day.[1]\n\nCareer and activism[edit]\nUnable to find work in theater after graduating from college, Cruz worked as a hairdresser. She struggled financially, and became addicted to crack cocaine.[1]\nCruz then began working at the Cobble Hill Nursing Home in Brooklyn. In 1996, four female co-workers groped and sexually harassed her.[1][3] With the help of the Anti-Violence Project, she reported the assault. Two of the four women were found guilty of harassment; the others were acquitted.[1][2]\nCruz then began working with the Anti-Violence Project in 1997.

She had one sibling, half-brother Timothy Holder, who is an openly gay Episcopal priest.[1][2] Her parents divorced and she was mostly raised by her maternal grandmother. Her maternal grandmother was Ann Uglialoro, a well-known East Village bar owner known as Slugger Ann. Jackie performed as both a man and a woman throughout her career. While performing in drag, Curtis would typically wear lipstick, glitter, bright red hair, ripped dresses, and stockings. Curtis pioneered this combination of trashy and glamour, a style that has prompted assertions that Curtis inspired the glitter rock or glam rock movement of the 1970s.\nAndy Warhol said of Curtis, \"Jackie Curtis is not a drag queen. Jackie is an artist. A pioneer without a frontier.\" Primarily a stage actress, Curtis debuted at the age of 17 in Tom Eyen's play Miss Neferititi Regrets produced in 1965 at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club.[3] Curtis began writing her own plays immediately after this production. Her productions often featured well-known transgender people, such as Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn. Curtis' work was influenced by the Playhouse of the Ridiculous, a resident company at La MaMa. As writer and lead actress, her plays included Glamour, Glory and Gold, which also starred Darling, Melba LaRose, Jr., and Robert De Niro in his first appearance on stage, playing several roles; Vain Victory, with Darling and Mario Montez; Amerika Cleopatra featuring Harvey Fierstein; Femme Fatale, with Patti Smith, Jayne County and Penny Arcade; and Heaven Grand in Amber Orbit with Ruby Lynn Reyner and Holly Woodlawn.\nWhile writing plays, Curtis continued to act. She reprised her role as Ptolemy II in a 1966 production of Miss Nefertiti Regrets at La MaMa.[4] In 1969, she performed with the Playhouse of the Ridiculous in Tom Murrin's Cock-Strong alongside Penny Arcade, Anthony Ingrassia, and others. Music for the production was written by Ralph Czitrom and performed by the Silver Apples.[5] She co-directed a production of her own play, Vain Victory, at La MaMa in 1971,[6] and directed and performed in Nick Markovich's I Died Yesterday at La MaMa in 1983.[7]\nAndy Warhol and director Paul Morrissey cast Curtis and Darling in Flesh (1968) and, with the addition of Holly Woodlawn, in Women in Revolt (1971), a comedic spoof of the women's liberation movement.\nCurtis was also a singer and poet. In 1974, Curtis and Woodlawn appeared in Cabaret in the Sky at the New York Cultural Center. An album by Paul Serrato collecting songs from the Curtis works Lucky Wonderful and Vain Victory, including the love ballad \"Who Are You\", which Curtis sang to Darling, was released in 2004. Curtis' poem \"B-Girls\", much of which is based on her observations of people who visited her grandmother's bar, Slugger Ann's, was included in the 1979 book The Poets' Encyclopedia. At eight pages long, it was the longest poem in the book.\n\nDeath[edit]\nJackie Curtis made two more movies during the 1980s. Drug addiction, however, took its toll on her,[8] and she died from a heroin overdose in 1985.[9][failed verification]\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nCurtis is named in Lou Reed's 1972 song \"Walk on the Wild Side\" which was about the 'superstars' Reed knew from Warhol's Factory. The verse speaks of her drug addiction and fascination with James Dean: \"Jackie is just speeding away / Thought she was James Dean for a day / Then I guess she had to crash / Valium would have helped that bash\".[10]\nIn 2004, a documentary about Curtis, Superstar in a Housedress, exposed some little-known facts about Curtis to a wider public. Curtis' influence on a number of people, including friends and associates such as Holly Woodlawn, Joe Dallesandro, and Penny Arcade, and observers such as David Bowie, are noted in the film. Jayne County writes of Jackie as being \"...the biggest influence on me at this time.\"[11]\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1968\n\nFlesh\n\nJackie\n\n\n\n\n1971\n\nW.R.: Mysteries of the Organism\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n1971\n\nWomen in Revolt\n\nJackie\n\n\n\n\n1971\n\nAn American Family\n\nHerself\n\n1 episode\n\n\n1973\n\nThe Corner Bar\n\nHerself\n\n1 episode\n\n\n1980\n\nUnderground U.S.A.\n\nRoommate\n\n\n\n\n1983\n\nBurroughs: the Movie\n\nNurse\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\nThe Cockettes\n\nHerself\n\narchival footage\n\n\n2004\n\nSuperstar in a Housedress\n\nHerself\n\narchival footage\n\n\n2010\n\nBeautiful Darling\n\nHerself\n\narchival footage\n\n\nPlays (as playwright)[edit]\nGlamour, Glory and Gold (1967)\nLucky Wonderful\nAmerika Cleopatra (1968)\nHeaven Grand in Amber Orbit (1970)\nFemme Fatale\nVain Victory: Vicissitudes of the Damned (1971)\nThe Trojan Women (1972)\nTyrone X (1979)\nI Died Yesterday (1983)\nChampagne (1985)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Interviews in Superstar in a Housedress Accessed 4/4/2015.\n\n^ About Timothy Holder Accessed 4/4/2015.\n\n^ La MaMa Archives Digital Collections. \"Production: Miss Nefertiti Regrets (1965)\".

She spent much of her childhood watching television and old Hollywood movies, from which she learned to impersonate her favorite actresses such as Joan Bennett and Kim Novak. She had one half-brother, Warren Law II, from her mother's first marriage to Warren Law. Warren Law II left to serve in the United States military and left Darling as the only child. Law would later deny his connection to Darling.\nIn a biography about Darling, Cynthia Carr reveals that Darling was \"relentlessly bullied\" in high school and dropped out at the age of 16 after a group of boys tried to lynch her.[3]\nIn 1961, she signed up for a course at the DeVern School of Cosmetology in Baldwin, Long Island.[7] Darling later said that she \"learned about the mysteries of sex from a salesman in a local children's shoe store\" and finally revealed an inclination towards cross-dressing when her mother confronted her about local rumors, which described Darling as \"dressing as a girl\" and frequenting a local gay bar called The Hayloft. In response, Darling left the room and returned in feminine clothing. Darling's mother would later say that, \"I knew then... that I couldn't stop Jimmy. Candy was just too beautiful and talented.\"[8]\nAfter coming out publicly, Darling would take a short cab ride to the Long Island Rail Road station, avoiding the attention of neighbors she would receive by walking to the train. From there, she would take the train to Manhattan, often sitting across from Long Island starlet Joey Heatherton.[2] In Manhattan, she would refer to her family home at 79 First Avenue in Massapequa Park as her \"country house\", and spent time in Greenwich Village, meeting people through Seymour Levy on Bleecker Street.\nDarling met Jeremiah Newton in the summer of 1966, when Newton was on his first trip to Greenwich Village from his home in Flushing, Queens. The two became friends and roommates, living together in Manhattan and Brooklyn until the time of Darling's death in 1974.[7]\nDarling first took the name Hope Slattery. According to Bob Colacello, Darling took this name in 1963/1964 after she started going to gay bars in Manhattan and visiting a doctor on Fifth Avenue for hormone injections. Jackie Curtis said that Darling adopted the name from a well-known Off Broadway actress named Hope Stansbury, with whom she lived for a few months in an apartment behind the Caffe Cino. Holly Woodlawn remembers that Darling's name evolved from Hope Dahl to Candy Dahl, then to Candy Cane. Jeremiah Newton said she took the name \"Candy\" out of a love for sweets. In her autobiography, Woodlawn recalled that Darling had adopted the name because a friend of hers called her \"darling\" so often that it stuck.\n\nWarhol years[edit]\nBefore they met, in 1967, Darling saw Andy Warhol at The Tenth of Always, an after-hours club. Darling was with Jackie Curtis, who invited Warhol to a play that she had written and directed, called Glamour, Glory and Gold, starring Darling as \"Nona Noonan\" and a young Robert De Niro, who played six parts in the play.[9]\nWarhol cast Darling in a short comedic scene in Flesh (1968) with Jackie Curtis and Joe Dallesandro. After Flesh, Darling was cast in a central role in Women in Revolt (1971).\nWomen in Revolt was first shown at the first Los Angeles Filmex as Sex. It was later shown as Andy Warhol's Women.\nThe day after the celebrity preview, a group of women carrying protest signs demonstrated outside the cinema against the film, which they thought was anti-women's liberation. When Darling heard about this, she said, \"Who do these dykes think they are anyway? Well, I just hope they all read Vincent Canby's review in today's Times. He said I look like a cross between Kim Novak and Pat Nixon. It's true\u00a0\u2013 I do have Pat Nixon's nose.\" [10]\nDarling worked for a short time as a barmaid at Slugger Ann's, the bar owned by Jackie Curtis's grandmother.[11]\n\nAfter Warhol[edit]\nDarling went on to appear in other independent films, including Silent Night, Bloody Night, Wynn Chamberlain's Brand X, and a co-starring role in Some of My Best Friends Are...[12] She appeared in Klute with Jane Fonda and Lady Liberty with Sophia Loren. In 1971, she went to Vienna to make two films with director Werner Schroeter:The Death of Maria Malibran, and another film that was never released. Darling's attempt at breaking into mainstream movies, by campaigning for the leading role in Myra Breckinridge (1970), led to rejection and bitterness.\nHer theatre credits include two Jackie Curtis plays, Glamour, Glory and Gold (1967) and Vain Victory: The Vicissitudes of the Damned (1971). Vain Victory was directed by Curtis at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in May/June 1971, and featured many other performers from Warhol's Factory, including Curtis, Ondine, Tally Brown, Mario Montez, Samuel Adams Green, Mary Woronov, Francesco Scavullo, Jay Johnson (twin brother of Jed Johnson), Holly Woodlawn, Steina and Woody Vasulka, Eric Emerson, and Warhol himself.[13]\nDarling was in the original 1972 production of Tennessee Williams' play Small Craft Warnings, cast at Williams' request. she starred in the 1973 revival of The White Whore and the Bit Player, a 1964 play by Tom Eyen, at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. The production was bilingual, called The White Whore and the Bit Player/La Estrelle y La Monja, and directed by Manuel Martin Jr. Darling's character, a Hollywood actress known only as \"the Whore\", was based on Marilyn Monroe. She performed in the English version opposite Hortensia Colorado, and the Spanish version was performed by Magaly Alabau and Graciela Mas.[14] As a review of the play stated, \"With her teased platinum hair and practiced pouts, Miss Darling looks like her character and resolutely keeps her acting little-girl-lost. The role-playing aspect works to her advantage. She could, after all, be a male lunatic pretending to be the White Whore.\"[15]\n\nIllness and death[edit]\nDarling died of lymphoma on March 21, 1974, aged 29, at the Columbus Hospital division of the Cabrini Health Care Center.[7][16][17] In a letter written on her deathbed and intended for Warhol and his followers, Darling wrote, \"Unfortunately before my death I had no desire left for life\u00a0... I am just so bored by everything. You might say bored to death. Did you know I couldn't last. I always knew it. I wish I could meet you all again.\"[18]\nHer funeral, held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, was attended by huge crowds. Julie Newmar read the eulogy.[19] Darling's birth name was never spoken by the minister or any of the eulogizers. Faith Dane played a piano piece, and Gloria Swanson saluted Darling's coffin.[20]\nDarling was cremated, and her ashes were interred by Jeremiah Newton in the Cherry Valley Cemetery in Cherry Valley, New York, a village at the foot of the Catskill Mountains.\n\nLegacy[edit]\n2010 documentary[edit]\nA feature-length documentary on Darling, titled Beautiful Darling, premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival (or Berlinale) in February 2010. The documentary features archival film and video footage, photographs, personal papers, archival audio interviews with Tennessee Williams, Valerie Solanas, Jackie Curtis and Darling's mother, as well as contemporary interviews with Holly Woodlawn, Ruby Lynn Reyner,  Fran Lebowitz, John Waters, Julie Newmar, Peter Beard, and Taylor Mead. Chlo\u00eb Sevigny narrates the film, voicing Darling's private diary entries and personal letters. The film was directed by James Rasin and produced by Jeremiah Newton and Elisabeth Bentley.[21]\n\nPortrayals[edit]\nFilm[edit]\nDarling was first portrayed on film by Stephen Dorff in I Shot Andy Warhol (1996).[12]\nDarling is portrayed by Willam Belli in the 2011 HBO film Cinema Verite.[12]\nStage[edit]\nDarling was portrayed by Brian Charles Rooney in Pop!, a musical written by Anna K. Jacobs and Maggie-Kate Coleman and directed by Mark Brokaw at Yale Repertory Theatre in November\u2013December 2009.[22]\nDarling was portrayed by actor Vince Gatton in the off-Broadway production of David Johnston's play Candy and Dorothy, for which Gatton received a Drama Desk award nomination.[23]\nMusic[edit]\nDarling and her friend Taffy are mentioned in the chorus of the 1967 Rolling Stones song \"Citadel\".[24]\nDarling is the subject of the song \"Candy Says\", the opening track on The Velvet Underground's self-titled album in 1969, sung by Doug Yule.[25]\nThe second verse of Lou Reed's 1972 \"Walk on the Wild Side\" is devoted to Darling.[26]\nVisual arts[edit]\nGreer Lankton made a bust of Darling that was displayed at the 1995 Whitney Biennial.[27]\nPeter Hujar's photo, \"Candy Darling on her Deathbed\", was used by Antony and the Johnsons for the cover of their 2005 Mercury Music Prize-winning album I Am a Bird Now.[28]\nNamesakes[edit]\nIn 2009, C\u2606NDY, which calls itself \"the first transversal style magazine\", debuted. It is named after Darling.[29]\nByredo created a candle scent named after Darling.[30]\nBiopic[edit]\nIn January 2019, a biopic about Candy was announced. It will be written by Stephanie Kornick and executive produced by Zackary Drucker. The film is being produced by Christian D. Bruun, Katrina Wolfe, and Louis Spiegler.[31]\n\nWorks[edit]\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1968\n\nFlesh\n\nCandy\n\n\n\n\n1970\n\nBrand X\n\nMarlene D-Train\n\n\n\n\n1971\n\nLa Mortadella\n\nTransvestite\n\nAlternative title: Lady Liberty\n\n\n1971\n\nKlute\n\nDiscoth\u00e8que Patron\n\nUncredited\n\n\n1971\n\nSome of My Best Friends Are...\n\nKaren / Harry\n\n\n\n\n1971\n\nWomen in Revolt\n\nCandy\n\n\n\n\n1971\n\nLady Liberty\n\nTransvestite\n\nUncredited\n\n\n1972\n\nDer Tod der Maria Malibran\u00a0[fr]\n\n\n\nDirected by Werner Schroeter\n\n\n1972\n\nSilent Night, Bloody Night\n\nGuest\n\n(final film role)\n\n\n1973\n\nAn American Family\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\nThe Cockettes\n\nHerself\n\nArchive footage\n\n\n2004\n\nSuperstar in a Housedress\n\nHerself\n\nArchive footage\n\n\n2006\n\nAndy Warhol: A Documentary Film\n\nHerself\n\nArchive footage\n\n\n2010\n\nBeautiful Darling\n\nHerself\n\nArchive footage\n\nReferences[edit]\nCitations\n\n\n\n^ \"Transgender star recalled as muse\".

She also became known for a street act in which she played harp atop a high-rise tricycle in Manhattan.[1]\nIn the 90s, Baby Dee met fellow transgender musician and performance artist Anohni. The two became friends, and Hegarty later invited Dee to perform harp on her 1998 debut album, Antony and the Johnsons.[3] During this time, Dee returned to her childhood home in Cleveland and took up work as a tree surgeon.[4] Never having envisioned herself as a recording artist, Dee gave Hegarty songs she had written in hopes that she would perform them. Hegarty, instead, sent them to her friend David Tibet, founder of the music group Current 93. Tibet contacted Dee encouraging her to record an album for his label, Durtro.[3]\n\nThe Durtro Years: 2000\u20132006[edit]\nIn 2001, Baby Dee released her debut album, Little Window. The album was composed and produced by Dee and featured only her, singing and playing piano on seven songs bookended by two accordion instrumentals. Though the album went largely unnoticed at the time of its release, the few reviews it did receive were often positive.\nDee released her second album, Love's Small Song, in 2002. This album was recorded in much the same fashion as the first, with Dee acting as the sole producer, composer, and performer. This time, though, the album contained more varied instrumentation with layered tracks of vocals, piano, accordion, and harp. Dee even set the entire album against a recording of birdsong. Still, while the album received a few very positive reviews, it, too, garnered little attention.\nIn 2007, the out-of-print albums Little Window and Love's Small Song along with Made for Love, a 2005 three-song EP, were re-released in a 2-CD compilation entitled The Robin's Tiny Throat.\n\nDrag City: 2007\u2013present[edit]\nBy 2006, Baby Dee had grown tired of recording and returned to private life at her Cleveland home. Unfortunately, Dee's tree climbing career was cut short when a tree she was doctoring fell on a customer's home.[4] The incident left Dee jobless and in need of money. Soon though, Dee came into luck when she met musicians Will Oldham and Matt Sweeney who were both fans of her work. They offered to produce an album for her, and, while initially hesitant, Dee soon agreed.[5]\nIn 2008, Dee released her third official studio album and debut for Drag City, Safe Inside the Day. The album was her first to feature collaborators. Other performers included producers Oldham and Sweeney and fellow eccentric personality/singer-songwriter Andrew WK. The album garnered significantly more attention than its predecessors and was well-reviewed by most.\nIn 2010, Dee released her fourth album, a re-recording of a limited-edition book and CD entitled A Book of Songs for Anne Marie released by Durtro in 2004. The recording significantly expanded on the original version adding chamber orchestration and three additional songs. The album also featured Dee, for the first time, predominantly using harp as opposed to piano. Following in the path of Safe Inside the Day, it gained the artist further visibility and recognition. It was released on the Drag City label in America and on Tin Angel Records in the UK.\nIn 2011, Baby Dee released her fifth album, Regifted Light. The album was recorded in Dee's home and produced by friend and collaborator Andrew WK. It featured mainly instrumental tracks performed on a Steinway D grand piano with a small backing band.\nIn 2015, Baby Dee released her sixth album, I Am A Stick on Tin Angel Records. \"Working in what often sounds like a free-form style, the band's instrumentals punctuate Dee's piano arrangements, adding an element of unpredictability that's definitely more 'experimental' than anything she's done before\".[6]\n\nCollaborations[edit]\nBaby Dee has worked with Antony and the Johnsons, Andrew WK, and many other artists on the New York City scene. She has toured extensively with Current 93, playing piano and harp. She has also toured with Marc Almond and The Dresden Dolls. In 2010 she toured with Little Annie. In 2016 and 2017 she toured with Swans and later appeared on their 2019 album Leaving Meaning.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAssigned male at birth, Baby Dee is a transgender woman.\nHer sister, Mary Norris, is a copy editor at the New Yorker.[7]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAlbums\n\nLittle Window (Durtro, 2001)\nLook What The Wind Blew In (Durtro, 2001)\nLove's Small Song (Durtro, 2002)\nA Book of Songs for Anne Marie (Durtro / Jnana, 2004)\nSafe Inside the Day (Drag City, 2008)\nA Book of Songs for Anne Marie (Re-Released) (Drag City / Tin Angel, 2010)\nRegifted Light (Drag City, 2011)\nI Am a Stick (Tin Angel, 2015)\nEPs\n\nBaby Dee (Durtro, 2001)\nMade for Love (Durtro / Jnana, 2005)\nThe Robins Song (Durtro / Jnana, 2008)\nCompilations\n\nThe Robin's Tiny Throat (Durtro / Jnana, 2007)\nLive Albums\n\nLive in Turin (Precordings, 2006)\nLove Is Stronger Than Death / Baby Dee & John Contreras  (Bragagild, 2008)\nBaby Dee Goes Down To Amsterdam (Tin Angel, 2011)\nSingles\n\n\"The Robin's Tiny Throat\"            \u2013 Little Window\n\"Calvary\"                            \u2013 Little Window\n\"So Bad\"                             \u2013 Love's Small Song\n\"Dance of Diminishing Possibilities\" \u2013 Safe Inside the Day\n\"Safe Inside the Day\"                \u2013 Safe Inside the Day\n\"As Morning Holds A Star\"            \u2013 A Book of Songs for Anne Marie\n\"Regifted Light\"                     \u2013 Regifted Light\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Monger, James Christopher. \"Baby Dee Biography\".

His brother, Sir Robert Dillon, was the eighth Baronet of Lismullen in Ireland.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and transition\n2 Self and Roberta Cowell\n3 Later life\n4 Works\n5 Notes\n6 References\n\n\nEarly life and transition[edit]\nDillon was the second child of Robert Arthur Dillon (1865\u20131925), heir to the baronetcy of Lismullen, and his Australian wife, Laura Maud McCliver, n\u00e9e Reese. Dillon's mother died of sepsis ten days after giving birth. Dillon, assigned female at birth, was raised with older brother Bobby by their two aunts in Folkestone in Kent, England.\nDillon studied at St Anne's College, Oxford,  a women's college. Dillon was president of the Oxford University Women's Boat Club and won a blue for rowing, competing in the Women's Boat Race in 1935 and 1936. After graduating he took a job at a research laboratory in Bristol.[1]\nDillon had long been more comfortable in men's clothing and was more self-assured living as a male.[citation needed] In 1939, he sought treatment from Dr George Foss, who had been experimenting with testosterone to treat excessive menstrual bleeding; at the time, the hormone's masculinizing effects were poorly understood. Foss provided Dillon with testosterone pills but insisted Dillon consult a psychiatrist first, who gossiped about Dillon's desire to become a man, and soon the story was all over town. Dillon fled to Bristol and took a job at a garage. The hormones soon made it possible for him to pass as male, and eventually the garage manager insisted that other employees refer to Dillon as \"he\" in order to avoid confusing customers. Dillon was promoted to recovery-vehicle driver and doubled as a fire watcher during the Blitz.[2]\nDillon suffered from hypoglycemia, and twice injured his head in falls when he passed out from low blood sugar. While in the Royal Infirmary recovering from the second of these attacks, he happened to come to the attention of one of the world's few practitioners of plastic surgery. The surgeon performed a double mastectomy, provided Dillon with a doctor's note that enabled him to change his birth certificate, and put him in contact with the pioneering plastic surgeon Harold Gillies.[3]\nGillies had previously reconstructed penises for injured soldiers and performed surgery on intersex people with ambiguous genitalia. He was willing to perform a phalloplasty, but not immediately; the constant influx of wounded soldiers from World War II already kept him in the operating room around the clock. In 1945 Dillon enrolled in medical school at Trinity College, Dublin under his new legal name, Laurence Michael Dillon. A former tutor of Dillon's persuaded the Oxford registrar to alter records to show that he had graduated from all-male Brasenose rather than the women's college St Anne's, so that his academic transcript would not raise questions. Again he became a distinguished rower \u2014 this time for the men's team.[4]\nGillies performed at least thirteen surgeries on Dillon between 1946 and 1949. He officially diagnosed Dillon with acute hypospadias in order to conceal the fact that he was performing sex-reassignment surgery. Dillon, still a medical student at Trinity, blamed war injuries when infections caused a temporary limp. In what little free time he had he enjoyed dancing, but he avoided forming close relationships with women, for fear of exposure and in the belief that \"One must not lead a girl on if one could not give her children.\"  He deliberately cultivated a misogynist reputation to prevent any such problematic attachments.[5]\n\nSelf and Roberta Cowell[edit]\nIn 1946 Dillon published Self: A Study in Ethics and Endocrinology, a book about what would now be called transsexualism, though that term would not be introduced into the English language until 1949, when David Oliver Cauldwell introduced the word directly based on Magnus Hirschfeld's coinage (in German) of the term \"Transsexualismus\" in 1923. Dillon described \"masculine inverts\" as being born with \"the mental outlook and temperament of the other sex\", using Stephen Gordon in the novel The Well of Loneliness as an example. Since this form of inversion was innate\u2014a hidden physical condition similar to intersex\u2014it could not be affected by psychoanalysis and should instead be treated medically. \"Where the mind cannot be made to fit the body,\" he wrote, \"the body should be made to fit, approximately at any rate, to the mind.\"[6]\nSelf brought him to the attention of Roberta Cowell, who would become the first British trans woman to receive male-to-female sex reassignment surgery. Though Dillon was not yet a licensed physician, he himself performed an orchidectomy on Cowell, since British law made the operation illegal. Cowell's vaginoplasty was later performed by Gillies.\n\nLater life[edit]\nDillon qualified as a physician in 1951 and initially worked in a Dublin hospital. He then spent the six years at sea as a naval surgeon for P&O and the China Navigation Company.\nDillon had not revealed his own history in Self, but it came to light in 1958 as an indirect result of his aristocratic background. Debrett's Peerage, a genealogical guide, listed him as heir to his brother's baronetcy, while its competitor Burke's Peerage mentioned only a sister, Laura Maude  [sic]. When the discrepancy was noticed, he told the press he was a male born with a severe form of hypospadias and had undergone a series of operations to correct the condition. The editor of Debrett's told Time magazine that Dillon was unquestionably next in line for the baronetcy: \"I have always been of the opinion that a person has all rights and privileges of the sex that is, at a given moment, recognized.\"[7]\nThe unwanted press attention led Dillon to flee to India, where he spent time with Sangharakshita (Dennis Lingwood) in Kalimpong, and with the Buddhist community in Sarnath. While at Sarnath, Dillon decided to pursue ordination and became Sramanera Jivaka (after the Buddha's physician). Because Sangharakshita refused to allow Jivaka full ordination, and other frustrations with Sangharakshita's management of Triyana Vardhana Vihara, Jivaka turned to the Tibetan branch of Buddhism. He went to the Rizong Monastery in Ladakh. He was reordained a novice monk of the Gelukpa order, taking the name Lobzang Jivaka, and spent his time studying Buddhism and writing. Despite the language barrier he felt at home there, but was forced to leave when his visa expired. His health failed, and he died in a hospital at Dalhousie, India, on 15 May 1962, aged 47.\nWriting under both of his Buddhist names, Jivaka published Growing Up into Buddhism, a primer on Buddhist practice for British children and teens, and A Critical Study of the Vinaya, which looks at the Buddhist rules for ordination; both books were published in 1960. Two additional books by him were published in London in 1962: The Life of Milarepa, about a famous 11th century Tibetan yogi, and Imji Getsul, an account of life in a Buddhist monastery.\nAfter Dillon's death, his brother said he wanted to burn Dillon's unpublished autobiography, but the manuscript was saved by Dillon's literary agent and published  as Out of the Ordinary in 2017.[8]\n\nWorks[edit]\nSelf: A Study in Endocrinology and Ethics (1946), as Michael Dillon\nPoems of truth (1957), as Michael Dillon\nThe Life of Milarepa (1962), as Lobzang Jivaka\nImji Getsul (1962), as Lobzang Jivaka\nOut of the Ordinary: A Life of Gender and Spiritual Transitions (1962; published 2017) as Michael Dillon/Lobzang Jivaka\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Kennedy, 19-25.\n\n^ Kennedy, 26-51.\n\n^ Kennedy, 52-68.\n\n^ Kennedy, 69-76.\n\n^ Kennedy, 6-9, 71-72, 79-82.\n\n^ Rubin, Henry (2003).

The next section of \"Outsider\" was called \"6 Hours\" and premiered in 2005.[9] The piece portrays the process of coming-out about one's gender identity to a lover.[9] The piece also tackles parental relationships, and the whole thing takes place within the setting of a six-hour road trip.[9] The fourth piece, also from 2005 and entitled \"In Closing,\" was about mindfulness, the passage of time and mortality in a queer romantic relationship.[9] The piece featured Dorsey alongside Culbreth.[9] The final work of \"The Outsider Chronicles\" was the 2005 piece \"Creative.\"[9] The piece was about gender correction therapy, and was stylistically unique because it was directly addressed to audience members.[9] \"Creative\" also focused on the idea of physical ornamentation as a negotiation of power and a way to demonstrate discrimination against queer and transgender individuals.[12] The piece demonstrated the performative and immaterial aspects of ornamentation, specifically through the example of knitting.[12] The five distinct stories of \"The Outsider Chronicles\" were presented as a complete show at ODC Theater (San Francisco) in 2005, and was re-mounted as a full-evening at Dance Mission Theater (San Francisco) in 2006.[9] The work garnered Dorsey two Isadora Duncan Awards and a Goldie Award for performance.[13]\n\nUncovered: The Diary Project (2009)[edit]\n\"Uncovered: The Diary Project\" is the first of Dorsey's trilogy of full-evening works that reveal previously censored, buried and/or forgotten trans and LGBTQ history: \"Uncovered: The Diary Project\" (2009), \"The Secret History of Love\" (2013) and \"The Missing Generation\" (2015).[2][14]\n\"Uncovered: The Diary Project\" is an evening-length performance consisting of two works, entitled \"Lost/Found\" (2007) and \"Lou\" (2009).[9] Both of these works are built around diary entries.[9] The first piece, \"Lost/Found,\" is a duet danced by Sean Dorsey and Brian Fisher.[9] This 15-minute piece is based upon the diaries of transgender and LGBT people: Dorsey's childhood copy of Norman Rockwell's Diary for a Young Girl and several other diaries of LGBT people.[9]\nThe second piece, \"Lou,\" is a 45-minute suite of dances performed by Dorsey, Brian Fisher, Juan de la Rosa, and Nol Simonse.[15] \"Lou\" is based on the lifelong diaries of Lou Sullivan (1951-1991), an trailblazing transgender gay man and activist who lived in San Francisco until his passing from AIDS.[9][16][15] Sullivan was the center of the Bay Area and American FTM community during the 1980s.[9] He was considered one of the first gay-identified transgender men to physically transition, and he made many contributions to the transgender community.[15] Dorsey hoped to use his piece to highlight Sullivan's activism as well as his deeper emotional life.[9] \"Lou\" consists of 12 sections, and is based on two major textual sources: Sullivan's lifelong collection of journals, and Dorsey's own writing.[9] To create \"Lou,\" Dorsey spent a year hand-transcribing 30 years of Sullivan's diaries - which Sullivan bequeathed to San Francsico's GLBT Historical Society's archives before his death from AIDS complications.[17] Dorsey functions as a vessel that preserves and shares Sullivan's legacy, physicalizing the idea of futuritive possibility.[18] \"Uncovered: The Diary Project\" fights the possibility of historical erasure that transgender people like Dorsey or Sullivan are subject to. \"Uncovered\" is about the ways our culture remembers, constructs (or erases) history (especially trans history), the negotiation of masculinity by different people, identity negotiation, and the drive towards actualizing desire.[9][15]\n\nThe Secret History of Love (2013)[edit]\nDorsey created \"The Secret History of Love\" over a two-year period, after which it toured to 20 different U.S. cities.[3][19] The 75-minute show features the Sean Dorsey Dance company and transgender singer-songwriter Shawna Virago.[20] The piece features athletic modern-dance choreography, partnering, and a musically innovative soundtrack by seven different composers.[20] Dorsey created \"The Secret History Of Love\" by creating and conducting his National LGBT Elders Oral History Project, in which Dorsey recorded oral history interviews with trans and LGBTQ elders across the US.[21] \"The Secret History Of Love\" reveals the underground ways that trans and LGBTQ people managed to not only survive but also thrive in decades past, despite tremendous obstacles.[22] The piece was formulated through live interviews and oral accounts from ten LGBTQ seniors, their narratives demonstrating the ways that LGBTQ people survived and loved each other in past decades. These elders' voices and remarkable real-life stories are featured in the work's multi-layered soundscore, along with Dorsey's own writing and central narration.[21][20] Dorsey's show examines the complexity of being trans, LGBTQ and/or in love while being labeled a sexual and/or social deviant.[19] In older generations, \"the LGBTQ community maneuvered, took root despite intolerance, repression and violence against them while implicitly asking the question: will the coming acceptance of alternative lifestyles eventually win broad public approval?\"[19] Dorsey expresses how secrecy was a fundamental aspect of trans and LGBTQ life in past generations. The Secret History of Love won an Isadora Duncan Dance Special Achievement Award.[23]\n\nThe Missing Generation (2015)[edit]\n\"The Missing Generation\" was Sean Dorsey Dance's 10th Anniversary Season project and arguably Dorsey's most acclaimed work at that date. It was nominated for two different Isadora Duncan Awards, and was awarded an \"Izzie\" for Best Soundscore/Music/Text. Dorsey received an NEA (National Endowment for the Arts) grant to support the piece's creation in 2014, making Dorsey the first trans dance artist to be awarded an NEA grant.[24] \"The Missing Generation\" premiered in San Francisco in May 2015. The piece is currently on a 2-year national tour to 20 different cities.[11] \"The Missing Generation\" gives voice to transgender and LGBTQ longtime survivors of the early AIDS epidemic, portraying the historic and continuing devastating toll that the AIDS epidemic had on transgender and LGBTQ communities during the 1980s and 1990s. While the AIDS crisis was most prominent in the 1980s, Dorsey's work emphasizes the importance of intergenerational sharing and the retainment of history.[25] Dorsey spent two years recording 75 hours of oral history interviews with trans and LGBTQ survivors of the early AIDS crisis, as well as conducting archival research in several cities, including San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta, Maine, and Washington DC.[26][25] This research resulted in 75 hours of oral material; Dorsey spent over 500 hours building a soundscore that incorporates a fraction of these 75 hours of voices/interviews, and worked with four composers, who created original music for the show's soundscore.[26] The score was composed by Alex Kelly, Ben Kessler, Jesse Olsen Bay, and Jeffrey Alphonsus Mooney.[26] \"The Missing Generation\" featured Dorsey's 4-member ensemble: three queer cisgender male dancers who performed alongside Sean Dorsey: Nol Simonse, Brian Fisher, and ArVejon Jones.[26][27]\nThe dance piece is divided into 16 sections and is a multi-layered fusion of dance, story, theater and movement.[25][26] Two sections that contextualize the epidemic are called \"The Great Rainbow Migration,\" about the migration of many trans and LGBTQ people away from repressive home towns/cities and into/toward larger urban centers, and \"The Long Party,\" about the sexual revolution of the 1970s.[26] These sections reflect on the many LGBTQ people who formed new \"chosen\" families after being exiled from their original homes, many of them having to live \"double lives\" in their every day lives.[28] Unlike most AIDS narratives, which only focus on homosexual and bisexual cisgender males, Dorsey's piece highlighted the experiences and importance of the transgender community (especially trans women, and especially Black trans women and other trans women of color) within the AIDS epidemic.[11] Trans women of color simultaneously had some of the highest rates of infection and the least access to resources and rights protections.[25] The piece reflected not only on AIDS survivors, but also on the organizations, resources, and activism that held trans and LGBTQ communities together.[25] While political leaders failed to acknowledge or respond to the AIDS pandemic, there was a revolutionary sense of solidarity and compassion within trans and queer communities.[26] The piece is ultimately about themes that everyone can relate to, such as grief, loss, isolation, self-exploration, love, unity, and healing.[27]\nIn July 2017, \"The Missing Generation\" was presented at the American Dance Festival in Durham NC, making Dorsey the US' first trans dance artist presented at ADF.[29] In June 2018, The Joyce Theater in New York, NY presented the New York premiere performances of \"The Missing Generation,\"[30] making Dorsey the US' first transgender dance artist to be presented at The Joyce.[31]\n\nBoys In Trouble (2018)[edit]\nDorsey's \"Boys In Trouble\" premiered in April 2018 at San Francisco's Z Space before launching a 2-year, 20-city international tour.[32] \"Boys In Trouble\" is an 80-minute dance-theater work that unpacks contemporary American masculinity with unflinching honesty and from unapologetically trans and queer perspectives.[32] The work is performed by the 5 dancer-performers of Sean Dorsey Dance (Sean Dorsey, Brian Fisher, ArVejon Jones, Nol Simonse and Will Woodward),[33] with original music by Alex Kelly, Jesse Olsen Bay, Ben Kessler, Grey Reverend and Anomie Belle.[34]\n\"Boys In Trouble\" utilizes Dorsey's signature mix of full-throttle contemporary dance, storytelling, queer partnering, dialogue and monologues and humor to explore themes including toxic masculinity, body shame, whiteness, racism, trans identity, Black queer love and joy, and humorous send-ups of 'butch' and 'macho' identities.[35][32][36]\nCritical responses and reviews have called \"Boys In Trouble\" \u201ca visually stunning, emotionally rich, and profoundly timely examination of masculinity and gender by one of the nation\u2019s most visionary choreographers,\u201d (Bay Times)[35] \u201cpoignant \u2026 Dorsey\u2019s signature mix of happiness, heartbreak, confessional dialogue, salty language, goofy humor and gorgeous partnering,\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle)[32] and \u201clush, expansive dance \u2026 poignant\u201d (KQED).[37]\n\"Boys in Trouble\u201d was commissioned by Bates Dance Festival, Dance Place (Washington, DC), Highways Performance Space (Los Angeles, CA), Maui Arts & Cultural Center (Maui, HI), Seven Stages (Atlanta, GA), and the Queer Cultural Center (San Francisco, CA).[38]\n\nOther works[edit]\nOther choreographic works by Sean Dorsey include My Unmistakable Chosen (2001), A Small Class of Words (2002), Hero (2003), and choreography for Anohni's music video Epilepsy is Dancing (2008).[9]\n\nActivism[edit]\nDorsey's works reflect on LGBTQ themes while challenging social norms.[39] His works are largely an example of embracing one's sexuality, gender, and body through dance.\nMany of Dorsey's dance pieces use archival information, giving a historical and biographical component to his art. His combination of archival practice, artistic collaboration, and grassroots activism, make his performances sites for historical production.[40] Transgender issues are markedly underrepresented in art and media, and when they are presented it is usually by cisgendered individuals. Academic Jess O'Rear has stated that as a transgender person making transgender art, Dorsey's work has helped refute harmful tropes and stereotypes.[18] Critical reviews of his work highlight the tensions and intersections between transgender issues and other queer issues that Dorsey's work explores.[41] Other critics emphasize how he provides an example of the power of art for people undergoing transitions, changes, or traumas and the revolutionary and liberatory possibilities of \"finding joy through queer and transgender bodies and experiences, ultimately asserting the value of these lives through their celebratory presence in performance.\"[18]\nDorsey is a longtime advocate for Trans Equity in the dance field.[42] Dorsey is the founder and Artistic Director of the trans arts non-profit Fresh Meat Productions.[43] Fresh Meat Productions invests in the creative expression and cultural leadership of transgender and gender-nonconforming communities. The organization creates and commissions new work, presents performing arts programs, conducts education and engagement, and advocates for justice and equity in the Arts.[44] Dorsey directs Fresh Meat's national education and advocacy program TRANSform Dance.[45]\n\nAwards and recognition[edit]\nSean Dorsey Dance was named \"San Francisco's Best Dance Company\" by SF Weekly and one of the nation's \"Top 25 to Watch\" by Dance Magazine.[3][46] Sean Dorsey has won four Isadora Duncan Dance Awards and the Goldie Award for Performance.[3] Dorsey has been awarded many major commissions: National Dance Project / New England Foundation for the Arts, National Performance Network, Creative Work Fund, Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, San Francisco Arts Commission, Queer Cultural Center (San Francisco), The Theater Offensive (Boston), Links Hall (Chicago), Bates Dance Festival (Lewiston), Dance Place (Washington DC), 7 Stages (Atlanta), and Highways Performance Space (Los Angeles), Maui Arts & Cultural Center (Maui).[3] \"Dorsey has been profiled on PBS-TV, NBC-TV, NPR-radio, BalletTanz, Time Out New York, Dance Magazine, American Theater Magazine, OUT Magazine, The Advocate, San Francisco Magazine, San Francisco Chronicle, SF Weekly, LA Weekly, Miami Herald, Chicago\u2019s Windy City Times, Boston\u2019s Bay Windows, New York\u2019s Dance Insider, Philadelphia Dance Journal, San Antonio Current, Curve Magazine and many other publications.\"[3]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Howard, Rachel (January 28, 2009). \"Sean Dorsey tells transsexual gay man's story\".

His short reign was conspicuous for sex scandals and religious controversy. He was cousin to the emperor Caracalla, and came from a prominent Arab family in Emesa (Homs), Syria, where in his early youth he served as head priest of the sun god Elagabal. After the death of Caracalla, Elagabalus was raised to the principate at 14 years of age in an army revolt instigated by his grandmother, Julia Maesa, against Caracalla's short-lived successor, Macrinus. As a private citizen, he was probably named Varius Avitus Bassianus. Upon becoming emperor he took the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and became known by the Latinised name of his god only after his death.[c]\nLater historians suggest Elagabalus showed a disregard for Roman religious traditions and sexual taboos. He replaced the traditional head of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter, with the deity Elagabal, of whom he had been high priest. He forced leading members of Rome's government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity, over which he presided. He married four women, including a Vestal Virgin, and lavished favours on male courtiers thought to have been his lovers.[5][6] He was also reported to have prostituted himself.[7] His behavior estranged the Praetorian Guard, the Senate, and the common people alike. Amidst growing opposition, Elagabalus, just 18 years old, was assassinated and replaced by his cousin Severus Alexander in March 222. The assassination plot against Elagabalus was devised by his grandmother, Julia Maesa, and carried out by disaffected members of the Praetorian Guard.\nElagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for extreme eccentricity, decadence, and zealotry. This tradition has persisted, and with writers of the early modern age he suffered one of the worst reputations among Roman emperors. Edward Gibbon, for example, wrote that Elagabalus \"abandoned himself to the grossest pleasures with ungoverned fury\".[8] According to Barthold Georg Niebuhr, \"the name Elagabalus is branded in history above all others\" because of his \"unspeakably disgusting life\".[9] An example of a modern historian's assessment is Adrian Goldsworthy's: \"Elagabalus was not a tyrant, but he was an incompetent, probably the least able emperor Rome had ever had.\"[10] Despite universal condemnation of his reign, some scholars do write warmly about him, including 6th century Roman chronicler John Malalas, and Warwick Ball, a modern historian who described him as innovative and \"a tragic enigma lost behind centuries of prejudice\".[11]\nBecause of accounts by contemporary historian Cassius Dio and others that Elagabalus wore women's clothing, preferred to be called a lady, and sought vaginoplasty, the emperor is considered by some historians to be an early transgender figure and one of the first on record as seeking sex reassignment surgery.[12]\n\nContents\n\n1 Family and priesthood\n2 Rise to power\n3 Emperor (218\u2013222)\n\n3.1 Journey to Rome and political appointments\n3.2

aug\u00b7Sculpture of Julia Soaemias\nElagabalus was born in 203 or 204 CE,[13][14] to Sextus Varius Marcellus and Julia Soaemias Bassiana,[15] who had probably married around the year 200 (and no later than 204).[16][17] Elagabalus's full birth name was probably (Sextus) Varius Avitus Bassianus,[d] the last name being apparently a cognomen of the Emesene dynasty.[18] Marcellus was an equestrian, later elevated to a senatorial position.[15][14][16] Julia Soaemias was a cousin of the emperor Caracalla, and there were rumors (which Soaemias later publicly supported) that Elagabalus was Caracalla's child.[14][19] Marcellus's tombstone attests that Elagabalus had at least one brother,[20][21] about whom nothing is known.[17] Elagabalus's grandmother, Julia Maesa, was the widow of the consul Julius Avitus, the sister of Julia Domna, and the sister-in-law of the emperor Septimius Severus.[15][16] Other relatives included Elagabalus's aunt Julia Avita Mamaea and uncle Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus and their son Severus Alexander.[15]\nElagabalus's family held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the sun god Elagabal, of whom Elagabalus was the high priest at Emesa (modern Homs) in Roman Syria as part of the Arab Emesene dynasty.[22] The deity's Latin name, \"Elagabalus\", is a Latinized version of the Arabic Il\u0101h ha-Gabal, from il\u0101h (\"god\") and gabal (\"mountain\"), meaning \"God of the Mountain\",[23] the Emesene manifestation of Ba'al.[24] Initially venerated at Emesa, the deity's cult spread to other parts of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century; a dedication has been found as far away as Woerden (in the Netherlands), near the Roman limes.[25] The god was later imported to Rome and assimilated with the sun god known as Sol Indiges in the era of the Roman Republic and as Sol Invictus during the late third century.[26] In Greek, the sun god is Helios, hence Elagabal was later known as \"Heliogabalus\", a hybrid of \"Helios\" and \"Elagabalus\".[27]\n\nRise to power[edit]\nHerodian writes that when the emperor Macrinus came to power, he suppressed the threat to his reign from the family of his assassinated predecessor, Caracalla, by exiling them\u2014Julia Maesa, her two daughters, and her eldest grandson Elagabalus\u2014to their estate at Emesa in Syria.[28] Almost upon arrival in Syria, Maesa began a plot with her advisor and Elagabalus's tutor, Gannys, to overthrow Macrinus and elevate the fourteen-year-old Elagabalus to the imperial throne.[28]\nMaesa spread a rumor, which Soaemias publicly supported, that Elagabalus was the illegitimate child of Caracalla[19][29] and so deserved the loyalty of Roman soldiers and senators who had sworn allegiance to Caracalla.[30] The soldiers of the Third Legion Gallica at Raphana, who had enjoyed greater privileges under Caracalla and resented Macrinus (and may have been impressed or bribed by Maesa's wealth), supported this claim.[14][29][31] At sunrise on 16 May 218, Elagabalus was declared emperor[31] by Publius Valerius Comazon, commander of the legion.[32] To strengthen his legitimacy, Elagabalus adopted the same name Caracalla bore as emperor, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.[33][34] Cassius Dio states that some officers tried to keep the soldiers loyal to Macrinus, but they were unsuccessful.[14]\n\n Reverse of an aureus of Elagabalus, marked: salus antonini aug\u00b7 (\"the Health of Antoninus Augustus\")\nPraetorian prefect Ulpius Julianus responded by attacking the Third Legion, most likely on Macrinus's orders (though one account says he acted on his own before Macrinus knew of the rebellion).[35] Herodian suggests Macrinus underestimated the threat, considering the rebellion inconsequential.[36] During the fighting, Julianus's soldiers killed their officers and joined Elagabalus's forces.[33]\nMacrinus asked the Roman Senate to denounce Elagabalus as \"the False Antoninus\", and they complied,[37] declaring war on Elagabalus and his family.[31] Macrinus made his son Diadumenian co-emperor, and attempted to secure the loyalty of the Second Legion with large cash payments.[38][39] During a banquet to celebrate this at Apamea, however, a messenger presented Macrinus with the severed head of his defeated prefect Julianus.[38][39][40] Macrinus therefore retreated to Antioch, after which the Second Legion shifted its loyalties to Elagabalus.[38][39]\nElagabalus's legionaries, commanded by Gannys, defeated Macrinus and Diadumenian and their Praetorian Guard at the Battle of Antioch on 8 June 218, prevailing when Macrinus's troops broke ranks after he fled the battlefield.[31][39][38] Macrinus made for Italy, but was intercepted near Chalcedon and executed in Cappadocia, while Diadumenian was captured at Zeugma and executed.[38]\nThat month, Elagabalus wrote to the senate, assuming the imperial titles without waiting for senatorial approval,[41] which violated tradition but was a common practice among 3rd-century emperors.[42] Letters of reconciliation were dispatched to Rome extending amnesty to the Senate and recognizing its laws, while also condemning the administration of Macrinus and his son.[43]\nThe senators responded by acknowledging Elagabalus as emperor and accepting his claim to be the son of Caracalla.[42] Elagabalus was made consul for the year 218 in the middle of June.[44] Caracalla and Julia Domna were both deified by the Senate, both Julia Maesa and Julia Soaemias were elevated to the rank of Augustae,[45] and the memory of Macrinus was expunged by the Senate.[42] (Elagabalus's imperial artifacts assert that he succeeded Caracalla directly.)[46] Comazon was appointed commander of the Praetorian Guard.[47][48] Elagabalus was named pater patriae by the Senate before 13 July 218.[44] On 14 July, Elagabalus was inducted into the colleges of all the Roman priesthoods, including the College of Pontiffs, of which he was named pontifex maximus.[44]\n\n Denarius of Elagabalus, inscribed: imp\u00b7 antoninus pius aug\u00b7 on the obverse and fortunae aug\u00b7 on the reverse, showing Fortuna with a cornucopia and a rudder on a globe\nEmperor (218\u2013222)[edit]\nJourney to Rome and political appointments[edit]\nElagabalus stayed for a time at Antioch, apparently to quell various mutinies.[49] Dio outlines several, which historian Fergus Millar places prior to the winter of 218\u2013219.[50] These included one by Gellius Maximus, who commanded the Fourth Legion and was executed,[50] and one by Verus, who commanded the Third Gallic Legion, which was disbanded once the revolt was put down.[51]\nNext, according to Herodian, Elagabalus and his entourage spent the winter of 218\u2013219 in Bithynia at Nicomedia, and then traveled through Thrace and Moesia to Italy in the first half of 219,[49] the year of Elagabalus's second consulship.[44] Herodian says that Elagabalus had a painting of himself sent ahead to Rome to be hung over a statue of the goddess Victoria in the Senate House so people would not be surprised by his Eastern garb, but it is unclear if such a painting actually existed, and Dio does not mention it.[52][53] If the painting was indeed hung over Victoria, it put senators in the position of seeming to make offerings to Elagabalus when they made offerings to Victoria.[51]\nOn his way to Rome, Elagabalus and his allies executed several prominent supporters of Macrinus, such as Syrian governor Fabius Agrippinus and former Thracian governor C. Claudius Attalus Paterculianus.[54] Arriving at the imperial capital in August or September 219, Elagabalus staged an adventus, a ceremonial entrance to the city.[44] In Rome, his offer of amnesty for the Roman upper class was largely honored, though the jurist Ulpian was exiled.[55] Elagabalus made Comazon praetorian prefect, and later consul (220) and prefect of the city (three times, 220\u2013222), which Dio regarded as a violation of Roman norms.[54]  Elagabalus himself held a consulship for the third year in a row in 220.[44] Herodian and the Augustan History say that Elagabalus alienated many by giving powerful positions to other allies.[56]\n\n Aureus of Elagabalus, marked: imp\u00b7caes\u00b7 m\u00b7aur\u00b7 antoninus aug\u00b7\nDio states that Elagabalus wanted to marry a charioteer named Hierocles and to declare him caesar,[50] like (Dio says) he had previously wanted to marry Gannys and name him caesar.[50] The athlete Aurelius Zoticus is said by Dio to have been Elagabalus's lover and cubicularius (a non-administrative role), while the Augustan History says Zoticus was a husband to Elagabalus and held greater political influence.[57]\nElagabalus's relationships to his mother Julia Soaemias and grandmother Julia Maesa were strong at first; they were influential supporters from the beginning, and Macrinus declared war on them as well as Elagabalus.[58] Accordingly, they became the first women allowed into the Senate,[59] and both received senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of Clarissima, and Maesa the more unorthodox Mater Castrorum et Senatus (\"Mother of the army camp and of the Senate\").[45] They exercised influence over the young emperor throughout his reign, and are found on many coins and inscriptions, a rare honor for Roman women.[60]\nUnder Elagabalus, the gradual devaluation of Roman aurei and denarii continued (with the silver purity of the denarius dropping from 58% to 46.5%),[61] though antoniniani had a higher metal content than under Caracalla.[62]\n\nReligious controversy[edit]\n Reverse of an aureus of Elagabalus, with the baetylus transported in a quadriga. Inscription: sanct\u00b7 deo soli elagabal\u00b7 (\"to the Holy Sun God El-Gabal\")\n The baetylus of Elgabal back in its home temple at Emesa, on a coin of Uranius\nSince the reign of Septimius Severus, sun worship had increased throughout the Empire.[63] At the end of 220, Elagabalus instated Elagabal as the chief deity of the Roman pantheon, possibly on the date of the winter solstice.[44] In his official titulature, Elagabalus was then entitled in Latin: sacerdos amplissimus dei invicti Soli Elagabali, pontifex maximus, lit.\u00a0'highest priest of the unconquered god, the Sun Elgabal, supreme pontiff'.[44] That a foreign god should be honored above Jupiter, with Elagabalus himself as chief priest, shocked many Romans.[64]\nAs a token of respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some combination of the three to Elagabal as consort.[65] A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. There may have been an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome\u2014replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.[66]\nHe aroused further discontent when he married the Vestal Virgin Aquilia Severa, Vesta's high priestess, claiming the marriage would produce \"godlike children\".[67] This was a flagrant breach of Roman law and tradition, which held that any Vestal found to have engaged in sexual intercourse was to be buried alive.[68]\nA lavish temple called the Elagabalium was built on the east face of the Palatine Hill to house Elagabal,[69] who was represented by a black conical meteorite from Emesa.[43] This was a baetylus. Herodian wrote \"this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven; on it there are some small projecting pieces and markings that are pointed out, which the people would like to believe are a rough picture of the sun, because this is how they see them\".[70]\nDio writes that in order to increase his piety as high priest of Elagabal atop a new Roman pantheon, Elagabalus had himself circumcised and swore to abstain from swine.[69] He forced senators to watch while he danced circling the altar of Elagabal to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals.[70] Each summer solstice he held a festival dedicated to the god, which became popular with the masses because of the free food distributed on these occasions.[71] During this festival, Elagabalus placed the black stone on a chariot adorned with gold and jewels, which he paraded through the city:[72]\n\nA six horse chariot carried the divinity, the horses huge and flawlessly white, with expensive gold fittings and rich ornaments. No one held the reins, and no one rode in the chariot; the vehicle was escorted as if the god himself were the charioteer. Elagabalus ran backward in front of the chariot, facing the god and holding the horses' reins. He made the whole journey in this reverse fashion, looking up into the face of his god.[73]\nThe most sacred relics from the Roman religion were transferred from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, including the emblem of the Great Mother, the fire of Vesta, the Shields of the Salii, and the Palladium, so that no other god could be worshipped except in association with Elagabal.[74] Although his native cult was widely ridiculed by contemporaries, sun-worship was popular among the soldiers and would be promoted by several later emperors.[75]\n\nMarriages, sexuality and gender[edit]\n Roman denarius depicting Aquilia Severa, the second wife of Elagabalus. The marriage caused a public outrage because Aquilia was a Vestal Virgin, sworn by Roman law to celibacy for 30 years. Inscription: iulia aquilia severa aug\u00b7\nThe question of Elagabalus's sexual orientation is confused, owing to salacious and unreliable sources. Cassius Dio states that Elagabalus was married five times (twice to the same woman).[52] His first wife was Julia Cornelia Paula, whom he married prior to August 29, 219; between then and August 28, 220, he divorced Paula, took the Vestal Virgin Julia Aquilia Severa as his second wife, divorced her,[52][76] and took a third wife, whom Herodian says was Annia Aurelia Faustina, a descendant of Marcus Aurelius and the widow of a man Elagabalus had recently had executed, Pomponius Bassus.[52] In the last year of his reign, Elagabalus divorced Annia Faustina and remarried Aquilia Severa.[52]\nDio states that another \"husband of this woman [Elagabalus] was Hierocles\", an ex-slave and chariot driver from Caria.[77][6] The Augustan History claims that Elagabalus also married a man named Zoticus, an athlete from Smyrna, while Dio says only that Zoticus was his cubicularius.[6][78] Dio says that Elagabalus prostituted himself in taverns and brothels.[7]\nDio (who referred to Elagabalus with feminine pronouns)[77] says Elagabalus delighted in being called Hierocles's mistress, wife, and queen.[12] The emperor reportedly wore makeup and wigs, preferred to be called a lady and not a lord, and offered vast sums to any physician who could provide him with a vagina,[12][79] although Clare Rowan says that this last detail \"seem[s] to be entirely fictive\".[80] For this reason, the emperor is seen by some writers as an early transgender figure and one of the first on record as seeking sex reassignment surgery.[12][81][82]\n\nFall from power[edit]\nBy 221 Elagabalus's eccentricities, particularly his relationship with Hierocles, increasingly provoked the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard.[83] When Elagabalus's grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning, she decided that he and his mother, who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced. As alternatives, she turned to her other daughter, Julia Avita Mamaea, and her daughter's son, the fifteen-year-old Severus Alexander.[84]\nPrevailing on Elagabalus, she arranged that he appoint his cousin Alexander as his heir and that the boy be given the title of caesar.[84] Alexander was elevated to caesar in June 221, possibly on 26 June.[44] Elagabalus and Alexander were each named consul designatus for the following year, probably on 1 July.[44] Elagabalus took up his fourth consulship for the year of 222.[44] Alexander shared the consulship with the emperor that year.[84] However, Elagabalus reconsidered this arrangement when he began to suspect that the Praetorian Guard preferred his cousin to himself.[85]\nElagabalus ordered various attempts on Alexander's life,[86] due to failing in getting approval from the senate in stripping Alexander of his shared title.[87] According to Dio, Elagabalus invented the rumor that Alexander was near death, in order to see how the Praetorians would react.[88] A riot ensued, and the Guard demanded to see Elagabalus and Alexander in the Praetorian camp.[88]\n\nAssassination[edit]\n Statue of Elagabalus as Hercules, re-faced as his successor, Alexander Severus (National Archaeological Museum, Naples)\nThe emperor complied and on 11 March 222 he publicly presented his cousin along with his own mother, Julia Soaemias. On their arrival the soldiers started cheering Alexander while ignoring Elagabalus, who ordered the summary arrest and execution of anyone who had taken part in this display of insubordination.[89] In response, members of the Praetorian Guard attacked Elagabalus and his mother:\n\nHe made an attempt to flee, and would have got away somewhere by being placed in a chest had he not been discovered and slain, at the age of eighteen. His mother, who embraced him and clung tightly to him, perished with him; their heads were cut off and their bodies, after being stripped naked, were first dragged all over the city, and then the mother's body was cast aside somewhere or other, while his was thrown into the Tiber.[90] \nFollowing his assassination, many associates of Elagabalus were killed or deposed, including his lover Hierocles.[88] His religious edicts were reversed and the stone of Elagabal was sent back to Emesa.[91] Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate.[92] The practice of damnatio memoriae\u2014erasing from the public record a disgraced personage formerly of note\u2014was systematically applied in his case.[44][93] Several images, including an over-life-size statue of him as Hercules now in Naples, were re-carved with the face of Alexander Severus.[94]\n\nSources[edit]\nCassius Dio[edit]\nThe historian Cassius Dio, who lived from the second half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229, wrote a contemporary account of Elagabalus. Born into a patrician family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus, and then he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.[95]\n\n Obverse of an aureus of Elagabalus, marked: imp\u00b7caes\u00b7 m\u00b7aur\u00b7 antoninus aug\u00b7\nDio's Roman History spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229. His contemporaneous account of Elagabalus's reign is generally considered more reliable than the Augustan History or other accounts for this general time period,[96][97] though by his own admission Dio spent the greater part of the relevant period outside of Rome and had to rely on second-hand information.[95]\nFurthermore, the political climate in the aftermath of Elagabalus's reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Severus Alexander, who held him in high esteem and made him consul again, likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake,[98] but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.[99]\nHistorian Clare Rowan calls Dio's account a mixture of reliable information and \"literary exaggeration\", noting that Elagabalus's marriages and time as consul are confirmed by numismatic and epigraphic records.[80] In other instances, Dio's account is inaccurate, as when he says Elagabalus appointed entirely unqualified officials and that Comazon had no military experience before being named to head the Praetorian Guard,[100] when in fact Comazon had commanded the Third Legion.[47][48] Dio also gives different accounts in different places of when and by whom Diadumenian (whose forces Elagabalus fought) was given imperial names and titles.[101]\n\nHerodian[edit]\n Reverse of an aureus of Elagabalus, marked:fides exercitus (\"the Faith of the Army\")\nAnother contemporary of Elagabalus was Herodian, a minor Roman civil servant who lived from c.\u2009170 until 240. His work, History of the Roman Empire since Marcus Aurelius, commonly abbreviated as Roman History, is an eyewitness account of the reign of Commodus until the beginning of the reign of Gordian III. His work largely overlaps with Dio's own Roman History, and the texts, written independently of each other, agree more often than not about Elagabalus and his short but eventful reign.[102]\nArrizabalaga writes that Herodian is in most ways \"less detailed and punctilious than Dio\",[103] and he is deemed less reliable by many modern scholars, though Rowan considers his account of Elagabalus's reign more reliable than Dio's[80] and Herodian's lack of literary and scholarly pretensions are considered to make him less biased than senatorial historians.[104] He is considered an important source for the religious reforms which took place during the reign of Elagabalus,[105] which have been confirmed by numismatic[106][107] and archaeological evidence.[108]\n\nAugustan History[edit]\nThe source of many stories of Elagabalus's depravity is the Augustan History (Historia Augusta), which includes controversial claims.[109] It is most likely that the Historia Augusta was written towards the end of the 4th century, during the reign of emperor Theodosius I.[110] The account of Elagabalus in the Augustan History is of uncertain historical merit.[111] Sections 13 to 17, relating to the fall of Elagabalus, are less controversial among historians.[112] The author of the most scandalous stories in the Augustan History concedes that \"both these matters and some others which pass belief were, I think, invented by people who wanted to depreciate Heliogabalus to win favour with Alexander.\"[11]\n\nModern historians[edit]\n Aureus of Elagabalus, inscribed: imp\u00b7c\u00b7 m\u00b7aur\u00b7 antoninus p\u00b7f\u00b7 aug\u00b7\nFor readers of the modern age, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon (1737\u20131794) further cemented the scandalous reputation of Elagabalus. Gibbon not only accepted and expressed outrage at the allegations of the ancient historians, but he might have added some details of his own; for example, he is the first historian known to claim that Gannys was a eunuch.[113] Gibbon wrote:\n\nTo confound the order of the season and climate, to sport with the passions and prejudices of his subjects, and to subvert every law of nature and decency, were in the number of his most delicious amusements. A long train of concubines, and a rapid succession of wives, among whom was a vestal virgin, ravished by force from her sacred asylum, were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of his passions. The master of the Roman world affected to copy the manners and dress of the female sex, preferring the distaff to the sceptre, and dishonored the principal dignities of the empire by distributing them among his numerous lovers; one of whom was publicly invested with the title and authority of the emperor's, or, as he more properly styled himself, the empress's husband. It may seem probable, the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudice. Yet, confining ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people, and attested by grave and contemporary historians, their inexpressible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country.[114]\nThe 20th-century anthropologist James George Frazer (author of The Golden Bough) took seriously the monotheistic aspirations of the emperor, but also ridiculed him: \"The dainty priest of the Sun [was] the most abandoned reprobate who ever sat upon a throne\u00a0... It was the intention of this eminently religious but crack-brained despot to supersede the worship of all the gods, not only at Rome but throughout the world, by the single worship of Elagabalus or the Sun.\"[115]\n\nThe first book-length biography was The Amazing Emperor Heliogabalus (1911) by J. Stuart Hay, \"a serious and systematic study\"[116] more sympathetic than that of previous historians, which nonetheless stressed the exoticism of Elagabalus, calling his reign one of \"enormous wealth and excessive prodigality, luxury and aestheticism, carried to their ultimate extreme, and sensuality in all the refinements of its Eastern habit\".[117] Medal of Elagabalus, Louvre Museum. Inscription: imp\u00b7 antoninus pius aug\u00b7\nSome recent historians paint a more favourable picture of the emperor's rule. Martijn Icks, in Images of Elagabalus (2008; republished as The Crimes of Elagabalus in 2011 and 2012), doubts the reliability of the ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. He described ancient stories pertaining to the emperor as \u201cpart of a long tradition of \u2018character assassination\u2019 in ancient historiography and biography.\u201d[118]\nLeonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction? (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality played a role in the fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, his mother, and his immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day.[119]\nWarwick Ball, in his book Rome in the East, writes a very apologetic account of the emperor, arguing that the wild descriptions of his religious rites were exaggerated and should be dismissed as propaganda, similar to how pagan descriptions of Christian rites (involving cannibalism and unspeakable orgies) have since been dismissed. Ball describes the emperor\u2019s ritual processions (marriage of the gods) as sound political and religious policy; that syncretism of eastern and western deities deserves praise rather than the ridicule he received. Ultimately, he paints Elagabalus as a child forced to become emperor by his scheming grandmother, and who rightfully, as high-priest of a cult, continued his rituals even after becoming emperor, which he viewed as a secondary occupation. Finally, Ball notes the eventual victory of Elagabalus, as his deity would be welcomed by Rome in its Sol Invictus form, brought back from Emesa by Aurelian 50 years later. Sol Invictus came to influence the monotheist Christian beliefs of Constantine, being grafted into Christianity till this day.[120]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nDespite the attempted damnatio memoriae, stories about Elabalus survived and figured in many works of art and literature.[121] In Spanish, his name became a word for \"glutton\", heliog\u00e1balo.[121][122] Due to the ancient stories about him, he often appears in literature and other creative media as a decadent figure (becoming something of an anti-hero in the Decadent movement of the late 19th century, and inspiring many famous works of art, especially by Decadents)[81] and the epitome of a young, amoral aesthete. The most notable of these works include:[123]\n\n Illustration by Auguste Leroux for the 1902 edition of Jean Lombard's of L'agonie showing the migration of the baetylus of Elgabal, though with the emperor riding rather than leading the god's chariot\nL'Agonie (1888) by Jean Lombard,[124] which was the inspiration for Louis Couperus's De berg van licht (The Mountain of Light) in 1905\u201306;\nH\u00e9liogabale ou l'Anarchiste couronn\u00e9 (Heliogabalus or The Anarchist Crowned) by Antonin Artaud (1934), depicting the life of Elagabalus and combining essay, biography, and fiction;[125]\nhistorical novels Family Favourites (1960) by Alfred Duggan and Child of the Sun (1966) by Kyle Onstott and Lance Horner, in the former of which an ordinary Roman soldier witnesses the reign; and\nVictor Pelevin's  Sol Invictus, which depicts Elagabalus as a key unrecognized spiritual figure.\nPlays[edit]\nHeliogabalus: A Buffoonery in Three Acts (1920) by H.

She died from complications following a uterus transplant.[5][6][7] The US and UK English versions of her semi-autobiographical narrative were published posthumously in 1933 under the title Man into Woman: An Authentic Record of a Change of Sex.[8][9]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Marriage and modeling\n3 Surgeries and dissolution of marriage\n4 Death\n5 In popular culture\n6 References\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nIt is generally believed that Elbe was born in 1882, in Vejle, Denmark. Her year of birth is sometimes stated as 1886, which appears to be from a book about her which has some facts changed to protect the identities of the persons involved. Facts about the life of her wife Gerda Gottlieb suggest that the 1882 date is correct because they married while at college in 1904, when Elbe would have been just eighteen if the 1886 date were correct.[10][11]\nIt is speculated that Elbe was intersex,[12][13][14] although that has been disputed.[15] Some reports indicate that she already had rudimentary ovaries in her abdomen and may have had Klinefelter syndrome.[2][5]\n\nMarriage and modeling[edit]\n Gerda Gottlieb, 1904\n Lili Elbe c. 1920\n Poplars along Hobro Fjord, 1908 - an example of Lili Elbe's work as a landscape painter\nElbe met Gerda Gottlieb while they were students at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen,[16] and they married in 1904 when Gottlieb was 19 and Elbe was 22.[17]\nThey worked as illustrators, with Elbe specialising in landscape paintings while Gottlieb illustrated books and fashion magazines.\nThey travelled through Italy and France before settling in 1912 in Paris, where Elbe could live more openly as a woman by posing as Gottlieb's sister-in-law.[18] Elbe received the Neuhausens prize in 1907 and exhibited at Kunstnernes Efter\u00e5rsudstilling (the Artists' Fall Exhibition), at the Vejle Art Museum in Denmark, where she remains represented, and in the Saloon and Salon d'Automne in Paris.[19]\nElbe started dressing in women's clothes after she found she enjoyed the stockings and heels she wore to fill in for Gottlieb's model, actress Anna Larssen, who on one occasion was late for a sitting. Larssen suggested the name Lili, and by the 1920s, Elbe regularly presented with that name as a woman, attending various festivities and entertaining guests in her house. Gottlieb became famous for her paintings of beautiful women with haunting, almond-shaped eyes, dressed in chic apparel. The model for these depictions of petites femmes fatales was Elbe.[20][21] Elbe stopped painting after her transition.[4][2]\n\nSurgeries and dissolution of marriage[edit]\n Lili Elbe by Gerda Gottlieb\nIn 1930, Elbe went to Germany for sex reassignment surgery, which was highly experimental at the time. A series of four operations were carried out over a period of two years.[21] The first surgery, removal of the testicles, was performed by Dr. Erwin Gohrbandt, under the supervision of sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld in Berlin.[22][21] The rest of her surgeries were carried out by Kurt Warnekros, a doctor at the Dresden Municipal Women's Clinic.[23]  (The clinic was later destroyed with its records in Allied bombing raids.[24]) The second operation was to implant an ovary onto her abdominal musculature, the third to remove the penis and the scrotum.[25]\n\n Lili Elbe by Gerda Gottlieb\nBy this time, her case was a sensation in Danish and German newspapers. A Danish court annulled the couple's marriage in October 1930,[26] and Elbe was able to have her sex and name legally changed, including receiving a passport as Lili Ilse Elvenes. \nShe returned to Dresden and adopted the surname Elbe to honor the Elbe River that flows through the city.[27][28][29] She began a relationship with French art dealer Claude Lejeune, whom she wanted to marry and with whom she wished to have children.\nIn 1931, she had her fourth surgery, to transplant a uterus and construct a vaginal canal.[6][7][30][5] This made her the second transgender woman to undergo a vaginoplasty surgery, a few weeks after Dr. Erwin Gohrbandt performed the experimental procedure on Dora Richter.[24]\n\nDeath[edit]\n Lili Elbe, 1930\nElbe's immune system rejected the transplanted uterus, and the operation and a subsequent surgical revision caused infection, which led to her death from cardiac arrest on 13 September 1931, three months after the surgery.[24][5][6][7][30][31]\nElbe was buried in Trinitatisfriedhof\u00a0[de] (Trinity Cemetery) in Dresden. The grave was levelled in the 1960s. In April 2016, a new tombstone was inaugurated, financed by Focus Features, the production company of The Danish Girl.[32][33] The tombstone does not record the date of Elbe's birth, just her name and places of birth and death.\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nThe LGBT film festival MIX Copenhagen gives four \"Lili\" awards named after Elbe.[34]\nIn 2000, David Ebershoff wrote The Danish Girl, a fictionalised account of Elbe's life.[35] It was an international bestseller and was translated into a dozen languages. In 2015, it was made into a film, also called The Danish Girl, produced by Gail Mutrux and Neil LaBute and starring Eddie Redmayne as Elbe. The film was well received at the Venice Film Festival in September 2015,[36] although it has been criticised for its casting of an English cisgender man to play a Danish transgender woman.[37] Both the novel and the film omitted topics including Gottlieb's sexuality, which is evidenced by the subjects in her erotic drawings,[38] and the disintegration of Gottlieb and Elbe's relationship after their annulment.[39]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Hirschfeld, Magnus.

She was interrogated by the FBI, and dishonorably discharged in 1965.[2][4] She later successfully petitioned to have her discharge changed to honorable.[2]\n\n Elizondo speaking at an August 2016 event in San Francisco\nActivism and career[edit]\nIn the 1960s, Elizondo was a patron of Gene Compton's Cafeteria in San Francisco, where the Compton's Cafeteria riot, an LGBT community uprising, occurred in 1966, three years before the Stonewall riots in New York City.[3] She is featured in Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria, a 2005 documentary co-directed and produced by Susan Stryker and Victor Silverman.[3][6]\nElizondo transitioned to female in 1974, while working as a long distance operator.[2][5] She has worked at a number of other jobs, including receptionist, clerk, and nurse's aid.[2][5] She was also a sex worker for a time.[2][7] She has performed as a drag queen for charity, and at gay clubs under the name Felicia Flames.[4][8]\nElizondo was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987.[2][5] She has worked for non-profit organizations, including P.A.W.S., Shanti Project, and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, that seek to improve quality of life for people living with serious illnesses.[8] She has contributed panels to the AIDS Memorial Quilt, and helped raise funds for non-profits including Project Open Hand and the San Francisco LGBT Community Center.[3] As a Latina, she has worked with other transgender women of color to combat racism in the community.[9]\nElizondo moved to San Francisco permanently in 1991.[2] In 2014, she worked with San Francisco supervisor Jane Kim to get the 100 block of Turk Street renamed to Vicki Mar Lane in honor of her late friend, drag performer Vicki Marlane.[10][11] In 2016, she again worked with Kim to rename the 100 block of Taylor Street to Gene Compton's Cafeteria Way.[12] Elizondo appeared at a number of events in 2016 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Compton's Cafeteria riot.[13]\nElizondo served as the lifetime achievement grand marshal in the 2015 San Francisco Pride Parade.[3][8]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Testimonies: Trans Lives Matter\".

Her parents met while protesting, which she cites as a background behind her activism. She is of Jewish heritage and grew up near the rural community of Willits, California,[4][5] where she said she experienced isolation, abuse, and violence, was not allowed to use the school restroom, and was threatened and bullied.[6]\nAt age 13, she transitioned to female, keeping her birth name. She then began her work in advocacy and writing while co-founded the organization Trans Student Educational Resources at age 16.[7] She attended Pitzer College in Claremont from 2013 to 2016, where she graduated early with honors.[8]\n\nActivism[edit]\nErlick cites starting her activism at age 15, in 2010, when she became a board member for a local LGBTQ youth conference. She became public in media over a year later while advocating for California's School Success and Opportunity Act, the first state bill to protect transgender students.[1] Erlick co-founded Trans Student Educational Resources, an organization \"dedicated to transforming the educational environment for trans and gender nonconforming students through advocacy and empowerment.\"[9]\nWhile advocating for comprehensive admissions rules for trans students at women's colleges, she spoke about the importance of remaining skeptical of all policy work.[10][11] In 2015, Erlick published an article on why equality should not be the goal of the transgender movement.[12] For her organizing, Erlick has been recognized in Refinery29 and The Advocate among other publications.[13][10]\nIn 2015, she led national efforts with Trans Student Educational Resources to admit trans women at women's colleges. She also co-authored Trans Student Educational Resources' model policy for admissions of trans students at women's colleges.[14][15]\nErlick also co-founded Trans Youth Leadership Summit, a program run through Trans Student Educational Resources and the only national fellowship program in the United States for transgender youth. Several of its fellows have gone on to become prominent media advocates, activists, and organizers since its launch.[16][17]\nIn 2017, she began publicly advocating for self-expression of gender-nonconforming transgender women.[18]\n\nTrans Student Educational Resources[edit]\nMain article: Trans Student Educational Resources\nIn 2011, at age 16,[1] Erlick co-founded Trans Student Educational Resources, an organization \"dedicated to transforming the educational environment for trans and gender nonconforming students through advocacy and empowerment.\"[9]\nIt is the only national organization led by transgender youth. She is currently the director of the organization. It is one of the largest transgender organizations in the United States.[3][19][20]\n\nAcademia[edit]\n Erlick speaking at Harvard University in 2018\nErlick has written articles focusing on political philosophy, social movements, and transgender communities.[21][22] In 2017, Glamour Magazine named her College Woman of the Year, the first trans woman to receive the honor in its 60-year history.[23] She is currently a doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Cruz in its Feminist Studies Department.[24] In a 2017 interview, Erlick stated she intends on becoming a professor.[25]\n\nPop culture[edit]\nIn 2016, Teen Vogue named her a \"New Face of Feminism\" as a \"young feminist changing the game\".[26] Erlick also writes for culture publications including Teen Vogue and Glamour magazine about transgender and queer culture, media, and fashion.[27][28]\nErlick has appeared in publications discussing fashion.[4][29] In an interview with Yahoo News, Erlick stated that she felt pressure to dress femininely based on the widespread conflation of gender identity and gender expression despite wanting to dress more masculinely.[30] Erlick describes herself as gender nonconforming.[31]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nShe is openly queer.[32]\nIn 2020, Erlick endorsed Bernie Sanders for president.[33]\n\nSelect Awards[edit]\n2013: Refinery29's 30 Under 30 SF[34]\n2015: Westly Prize for Young Innovators[35][36]\n2016: Davis Projects for Peace[37]\n2016: Teen Vogue's The New Faces of Feminism[38]\n2017: Glamour Magazine College Woman of the Year[39]\n2017: GO's 100 Women We Love[40]\n2017: Lambda Literary Award, LGBTQ Anthology (as contributor to The Remedy: Queer and Trans Voices on Health and Healthcare)[41]\n2018: Real Leaders 100[42]\nBibliography[edit]\n\"Transgender Medicine: Depathologization, Organizing, and Practice\" in Journal of the Student National Medical Association, 2014.[43]\n\"I Knew I Was a Girl at 8: Transitioning and Teenage Activism\" in Critical Perspectives on Gender Identity, Nicki Peter Petrikowski (ed.), Enslow Publishing, 2016.[44]\n\"Depathologizing Trans\" in The Remedy: Queer and Trans Voices on Health and Healthcare, Zena Sharman (ed.), Arsenal Pulp Press, 2016.[45]\n\"Trans Youth Activism on the Internet\" in Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, 2018.[46]\n\"(Trans)forming Education: How Transgender Youth Are Leading the School Justice Movement\" in Gender Diversity and LGBTQ Inclusion in Schools, Karyl E.

Her grandparents played classical Turkish music and she first took private lessons and then studied at Istanbul Municipal Conservatory.[5] Already one of Turkey's most popular singers and actors, she gained international notoriety in April 1981 after having sex reassignment surgery in London by a British plastic surgeon.[6] She kept the name \"B\u00fclent\" even though it is a typically masculine name.\n\nStage prohibition and restriction period[edit]\n\n\"Today I am very happy ... Nobody can make me angry. They're in the court right now. I tolerated 8 years of suffering. I'm very happy that justice is served. I won't get involved in the case. Now they are getting tried too.

I'm so happy, nobody can ruin my mood...\"\nB\u00fclent Ersoy on her 8-year stage ban and those who were involved in it, 4 April 2012[7]\n\n\nAfter the operation, Ersoy found herself in opposition to 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat of Kenan Evren. In a crackdown on \"social deviance,\" Ersoy's public performances were banned along with those of other transgender people. To circumvent the ban, she petitioned the Turkish courts to legally recognize her as a woman. The petition was rejected in January 1982. Days later, she attempted suicide.[8] In 1983, she left Turkey in protest of the Evren regime's repressive policies and continued her career in Germany. Later on in the decade in 1989 Evren left office and many of his policies were rescinded.\nErsoy continued her career mostly in (Germany) in addition to Turkey. Along with her musical career, she made several Turkish movies in Germany.\n\n2011\u201312: A\u015fktan Sab\u0131kal\u0131[edit]\n Classical Turkish music artists B\u00fclent Ersoy, Muazzez Abac\u0131 and Adnan \u015eenses, 2012\nIn late 2010, Ersoy announced that she had listened to nearly 1,500 songs in the last 2 years and found it difficult to choose the best songs for the album. Her new album A\u015fktan Sab\u0131kal\u0131 (Love Convict), was released on 3 October 2011. The album includes a song written by Can Tanr\u0131yar called \"Al\u0131\u015fmak \u0130stemiyorum\" (I Don't Wanna Get Used to It), and a classic by Orhan Gencebay: \"Bir Teselli Ver\", (Give Me Support). There also is a song by G\u00fcl\u015fen titled \"A\u015fktan Sab\u0131kal\u0131\", after which the album is named. Another piece in the album is a duet sung with Tarkan, titled \"Bir Ben Bir Allah Biliyor\", which was popular as it was performed by two of Turkey's leading artists. On 22 December, Ersoy released a music video for the song, nearly three months after it was first played on the radio.[9]\n\n2013 onwards[edit]\nIn her appearances on TRT in 2013, Ersoy was keen to stress that her pop-arabesque songs were only a 'vice' to earn an income and classical music, which she received her University education in, is where her true allegiance and support lies. Although her last album was released in 2011,[10] her last album where she sang classical and Alaturka (Turkish style) songs was in Alaturka 2000,[11] after which she hasn't produced any material covering Alaturka or Classical material.\nIn late 2015, Ersoy stated in a press conference how Orhan Gencebay had mentioned to her that no one prominent had been producing Alaturka for the last couple of years. She stated that it was their mutual plan to 'get together' and think about what to for an album in this area. In early 2016, Ersoy said that she had listened to hundreds of songs and wasn't satisfied with what was brought to her (this being songs in the Pop/Arabesque genre). Although it's unclear as to when her next production will be, Ersoy seems to have returned from her semi-retired status and is producing new material. She announced that she would publish a new song written by Tarkan, named \"\u00dcmit H\u0131rs\u0131z\u0131\", which was released in March 2019.\n\nControversies[edit]\nThe case filed by Deniz Baykal[edit]\nIn a magazine program in 2005, Ersoy talked about her attempts to end her stage ban, and added: \"During the period after the 1980 coup, a person who is now a party leader asked me for fortune to remove my stage ban.\" Following this statement, DYP leader Mehmet A\u011far said that he was not the leader in question. As a result, the eyes turned to the CHP leader Deniz Baykal.\nBaykal emphasized that at that time he was a lawyer and B\u00fclent Ersoy had telephoned to consult him and later met him in person for only 2 minutes. He also added that nothing related to money and fortunes was discussed between the two. In response, Ersoy held a press conference. She claimed that she had met with Deniz Baykal personally in an office behind Dedeman Hotel in Ankara and added: \"Mr. Deniz even had a gray suit on [during the meeting]. If I remember such details, I can remember you wanted 100 million back then, which is equal to 1\u00a0trillion today.\" She also claimed that the person who mediated the meeting was Mehmet Nabi, the famous mafia figure known as \u0130nci Baba. In addition, she said that she did not know whether the \u20ba100\u00a0million that Baykal had asked her was a solicitor's fee or that it would be used to distribute bribes to various people to lift the stage ban.[12]\nFollowing this press statement, Deniz Baykal filed a lawsuit against B\u00fclent Ersoy for the violation of his personal rights due to implications of both bribery and mafia involvement allegations.[13] At the end of the case, the court fined Ersoy, but when Ersoy objected to the decision, the case was moved to the Court of Cassation. On 25 March 2008, the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the local court and ordered B\u00fclent Ersoy to pay \u20ba15,000 along with its interest to Baykal for causing non-pecuniary damages.[14]\n\nThe case opened for her views on military service[edit]\nErsoy sparked controversy in February 2008 when she publicly criticised Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq and said she \"would not send her sons to war\" if she were a mother.[15][16] An Istanbul public prosecutor subsequently filed charges against her for \"turning Turks against compulsory military service\", an issue which had also brought prominent Turkish intellectual Perihan Ma\u011fden to trial in the past. The Turkish Human Right Foundation (IHD) stood up to Ersoy's defence. On 19 December 2008, Ersoy was pronounced not guilty of charges by a Turkish court.[17]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAlbums\n\n1973: Ah Tut-i Mucize Guyem\n1975: \u015e\u00f6hretler\n1975: Konser 1\n1976: Toprak Als\u0131n Murad\u0131m\u0131\n1976: Bir Tanr\u0131y\u0131 Bir de Beni\n1976: Konser 2\n1977: Konser 3\n1978: Orkide 1\n1978: \u00d6lmeyen \u015eark\u0131lar (eternal songs)\n1979: Orkide 2\n1979: Meyhaneci (the innkeeper)\n1980: Beddua[18]\n1981: Mah\u015feri Ya\u015f\u0131yorum\n1981: Y\u00fcz Karas\u0131\n1983: Ak G\u00fcvercin (white dove)\n1983: Ne Duams\u0131n Ne De Bedduam (you are neither in my prayers nor in my curses)\n1984: D\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcn\u00fcm Sana\n1985: Ya\u015famak \u0130stiyorum\n1986: An\u0131lardan Bir Demet\n1987: Suskun D\u00fcnyam\n1988: Biz Ayr\u0131lamay\u0131z\n1989: Avustralya Konseri\n1989: \u0130stiyorum\n1989: Se\u00e7meler\n1989: Bizim Hikayemiz\n1990: \u00d6pt\u00fcm\n1991: Bir Sen Bir de Ben\n1992: Ablan Kurban Olsun Sana\n1993: T\u00fcrk Sanat M\u00fczi\u011fi Konseri 1\n1993: T\u00fcrk Sanat M\u00fczi\u011fi Konseri 2\n1993: T\u00fcrk Sanat M\u00fczi\u011fi Konseri 3\n1993: T\u00fcrk Sanat M\u00fczi\u011fi Konseri 4\n1993: \u015eiirlerle \u015eark\u0131larla\n1993: Sefam Olsun\n1994: Ak\u0131ll\u0131 Ol\n1995: Alaturka 1995\n1995: Benim D\u00fcnya G\u00fczellerim\n1997: Maazallah\n2000: Alaturka 2000\n2002: Can\u0131ms\u0131n\n2011: A\u015fktan Sab\u0131kal\u0131\n2018: Alaturka\n\nSingles\n\"Dolmam\u0131\u015f \u00c7ilem\" (1980)\n\"\u00dcmit H\u0131rs\u0131z\u0131\" (2019)\nFilmography[edit]\nS\u0131ralardaki Heyecan (1976)\n\u00d6lmeyen \u015eark\u0131 (1977)\n\u0130\u015fte Bizim Hikayemiz (1978)\nBeddua (1980)\nS\u00f6hretin Sonu (1981)\nAc\u0131 Ekmek (1984)\nAsr\u0131n Kad\u0131n\u0131 (1985)\nT\u00f6vbekar Kad\u0131n (1985)\nBenim Gibi Sev (1985)\nEfkarl\u0131y\u0131m Abiler (1986)\nYa\u015famak \u0130stiyorum 1 (1986)\nYa\u015famak \u0130stiyorum 2 (1986)\nKara G\u00fcnlerim (1987)\nBiz Ayr\u0131lamay\u0131z (1988)\nAn\u0131lar (1989)\n\u0130stiyorum (1989)\nTelevision[edit]\nB\u00fclent Ersoy Show (1995\u20131996; 2013\u20132014) \u2013 Presenter\nB\u00fclent Ersoy'la Hat\u0131rla Bakal\u0131m (2005) \u2013 Presenter\nPopstar Alaturka (2007\u20132009) \u2013 Judge\nBeyaz Show (2012) \u2013 Guest\nArkada\u015f\u0131m Ho\u015fgeldin (2015) \u2013 Guest appearance\nBu Tarz Benim (2015) \u2013 Guest judge\nVar M\u0131s\u0131n\u0131z Yok Musunuz (2016) \u2013 Contestant\nD\u00fcnya G\u00fczellerim (2017) \u2013 Herself\n\u00c7ukur (2017) \u2013 Guest appearance\nPopstar 2018 (2018) \u2013 Judge\nKuaf\u00f6r\u00fcm Sensin (2020) \u2013 Judge\nSee also[edit]\nList of Turkish musicians\nMusic of Turkey\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \u00c7apa, \u0130zzet. \"B\u00fclent Ersoy R\u00f6portaj\u0131n\u0131n Hi\u00e7bir Yerde Yay\u0131nlanmam\u0131\u015f B\u00f6l\u00fcmleri\". gecce.com.

Mian Fazli Elahi Khan, Fazli's paternal grandfather, was a government officer of Rajput descent.  Khwaja Nazir Ahmad,[4] Fazli's maternal grandfather, was a successful lawyer and he ran the Civil and Military Gazette in Lahore, Pakistan.[5]  Fazli's grandmother was Begum Saeeda Nazir Ahmad.  His great-grandfather, Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din, was a prominent lawyer and an author and he founded the Woking Muslim Mission in the United Kingdom.\nFazli grew up in Lahore.[1]  His mother moved to the United States in the 1980s along with the family.\n\nReligious Affiliation[edit]\nFazli was born into a religious family, but he did not agree with the practices.[1]  In 2000, he converted to Christianity.[1][2]  He has been baptized.\n\nEducation[edit]\nFazli earned a B.A. in Political Science (pre-law track) from Rockford University, Illinois in 1994.  He got his B.A in Political Science and Economics with a minor in French in 1988 from Kinnaird College Lahore, one of the leading liberal arts colleges in Pakistan.  He attended the Sacred Heart School and the Convent of Jesus and Mary High School in Lahore.  In 1984, he received his University of Cambridge General Certificate of Education (GCE) O-Level in Science.\nAt Rockford University, Fazli was student government Vice President and wrote for the university newspaper.  He volunteered for charity activities.  He also served as a peer counselor for ADAPT (Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Team) at Rockford University.\nHe also attended Teachers College, Columbia University,[1] where he pursued an M.A. in English Education.  He received his Legal Studies Certificate from CUNY Hunter College in New York.\n\nCareer[edit]\nFazli is a paralegal.  He has been working in the following areas of law: intellectual property, personal injury, criminal defense, and immigration.  Fazli also taught in schools.  He interned with Congressman John Cox[6] of Illinois, 16th Congressional District in 1992.\nFazli worked as a staff reporter in Lahore and later he was a contributing writer for The Nation,[7] an English daily newspaper.\n\nCreative writing[edit]\nFazli started writing poetry in school.  He was in high school when his poetry was published.  His poetry and prose were also published in the Rockford University Journal of the Arts in the 1990s.  His book of poetry was published in 2004.[8]  He has written and directed plays.  Due to his playwriting, he was interviewed on PTV.\n\nGender Change and Conversion to Christianity[edit]\nFazli's family knew he was transgender.[1][2]  However, they refused to help him.[1][9]  His elder sisters, one of whom is a doctor, were opposed to his gender change.  In the 1990s, they hid his travel documents to prevent him from returning to the United States.  At that time, Fazli filed a police report with the local police against his family.  From that time onwards he did not keep in touch with his family.\nWith the help of his friends he underwent gender reassignment in the United States and began his life as Issa.[1]  In 2000, he reestablished contact with his family to inform them of his gender reassignment, his marriage to Saadia,[1][2][3] his childhood friend, and his conversion from Islam to Christianity.[1][3]  His family promised him a function to mark the new developments.[1][2][3]  Therefore, in 2000, Fazli and his wife traveled to Lahore hoping that the family had decided to accept the developments in his life.[1][2]  In reality, his parents were furious with him.[1] Fazli's father used his influence in government to prevent him from leaving Pakistan from 2000 to 2005.[2]  Fazli and his wife escaped several attempts on their lives.[1][3][9]  They approached the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.[1][2]  With the help of different organizations, Fazli was able to get out of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.[1][2]  In 2005, he came back to the United States.[1][2]  He now lives in the United States.[1][2][3]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t Tucker, Maria Luisa (February 26, 2008).

At fourteen years old, she began work at a display sign shop at a local department store. Feinberg eventually dropped out of Bennett High School, though she officially received a diploma. Feinberg began frequenting gay bars in Buffalo and  primarily worked in low-wage and temporary jobs, including washing dishes, cleaning cargo ships, working as an ASL interpreter, inputting medical data, and working at a PVC pipe factory and a book bindery.[11][12]\n\nCareer and recognition[edit]\nWhen Feinberg was in her twenties, she met members of the Workers World Party at a demonstration for the land rights and self-determination of Palestinians and joined the Buffalo branch of the party. After moving to New York City, Feinberg took part in anti-war, anti-racist, and pro-labor demonstrations on behalf of the party for many years, including the March Against Racism (Boston, 1974), a national tour about HIV/AIDS (1983\u201384), and a mobilization against KKK members (Atlanta, 1988).[11]\nFeinberg began writing in the 1970s. As a member of the Workers World Party, she was the editor of the political prisoners page of the Workers World newspaper for fifteen years, and by 1995, she had become the managing editor.[11][13][14]\nFeinberg's first novel, the 1993 Stone Butch Blues, won the Lambda Literary Award and the 1994 American Library Association Gay & Lesbian Book Award. While there are parallels to Feinberg's experiences as a working-class dyke, the work is not an autobiography.[6][7][8] Her second novel, Drag King Dreams, was released in 2006.[15]\nHer nonfiction work included the books Trans Liberation: Beyond Pink or Blue in 1992 and Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman in 1996. In 2009, she released Rainbow Solidarity in Defense of Cuba\u2014a compilation of 25 journalistic articles.\nIn Transgender Warriors, Feinberg defines \"transgender\" as a very broad umbrella, including all \"people who cross the cultural boundaries of gender\"[10]\u2014including butch dykes, passing women (those who passed as men only in order to find work or survive during war), and drag queens.[9]\nFeinberg's writings on LGBT history, \"Lavender & Red\", frequently appeared in the Workers World newspaper. Feinberg was awarded an honorary doctorate from Starr King School for the Ministry for transgender and social justice work.[16]\nIn June 2019 Feinberg was one of the inaugural fifty American \u201cpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\u201d inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn.[17][18] The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history,[19] and the wall\u2019s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.[20]\n\nIllness[edit]\nIn 2008, Feinberg was diagnosed with Lyme disease, a Tick-borne disease (multiple tick-borne infections). Feinberg has written that the infections first came about in the 1970s, when there was limited knowledge related to such diseases and that she felt hesitant to deal with medical professionals for many years due to her transgender identity. For these reasons, she only received treatment later in life. In the 2000s, Feinberg created art and blogged about her illnesses with a focus on disability art and class consciousness.[11]\n\nPronoun usage[edit]\nFeinberg stated in a 2006 interview that her preferred pronouns varied depending on context:\n\nFor me, pronouns are always placed within context. I am female-bodied, I am a butch lesbian, a transgender lesbian\u2014referring to me as \"she/her\" is appropriate, particularly in a non-trans setting in which referring to me as \"he\" would appear to resolve the social contradiction between my birth sex and gender expression and render my transgender expression invisible. I like the gender neutral pronoun \"ze/hir\" because it makes it impossible to hold on to gender/sex/sexuality assumptions about a person you're about to meet or you've just met. And in an all trans setting, referring to me as \"he/him\" honors my gender expression in the same way that referring to my sister drag queens as \"she/her\" does.\u2014\u2009Leslie Feinberg, 2006[3][21]\nFeinberg's widow wrote in her statement regarding Feinberg's death that Feinberg did not really care which pronouns a person used to address her: \"She preferred to use the pronouns she/zie and her/hir for herself, but also said: 'I care which pronoun is used, but people have been respectful to me with the wrong pronoun and disrespectful with the right one. It matters whether someone is using the pronoun as a bigot, or if they are trying to demonstrate respect.'\"[5]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.

Feldman's song \"Angry Atthis,\" first performed in May 1969 and first recorded in 1972,[4][5] is considered the first openly distributed out lesbian song[6] of what would become the women's music movement.[7][8] Feldman identified as a \"big loud Jewish butch lesbian.\"[9][10]\nIn later years Feldman embraced a gender-fluid identity, according to partner Helen Thornton. Thornton described her partner's identity as \"both/and\" rather than \"either/or.\"[11] Feldman had been comfortable with either gender label and wore men's clothing on stage.[10]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Death\n4 Legacy\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nFeldman was born on December 26, 1945 in Brooklyn, New York. As a child, Feldman had a stutter and requested lessons in acting. Feldman had a bit part as a Girl Scout Brownie on The Goldbergs. As a student at the High School of Performing Arts, Feldman performed in children's theater productions.[12]\nFeldman attended Emerson College in Boston to study theater arts. After being kicked out for being a lesbian, Feldman was sent to psychiatric treatment and refused the electroshock treatment used at the time.[12] In 1963, Feldman began performing on the vibrant Boston music circuit, at Beacon Hill and Cambridge coffeehouses such as the Turk's Head, the Orleans and the Loft.[12][13] At one point, Feldman introduced a then-unknown Jos\u00e9 Feliciano.[12]\nIn 1968, Feldman moved to Manhattan and then to Los Angeles. Feldman attended El Camino College[14] in Los Angeles County and helped to found the campus women's center.[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\n\"Angry Atthis,\" of course, is a play on words. I was \"angry at this\" lesbian oppression. My brainy girl side wanted to call my piece \"Sappho's Song,\" but then I read that Atthis was the name of one of Sappho's lovers. And \"Atthis\" began to appear to me as a better statement of all I felt. The song just spewed out of me.\n\u2014 Maxine Feldman\n\n\nFeldman wrote the consciousness raising song \"Angry Atthis\" in May 1969,[5] prior to the Stonewall Riots. The debut of the song in Los Angeles has been credited as the first performance of an openly lesbian song.[6][15]\nIn 1970\u20131971, Feldman met the feminist comedy duo Harrison and Tyler, who had come to perform at the college. After hearing the performance of \"Angry Atthis,\" Patty Harrison and Robin Tyler invited Feldman to open for them during their tour of the United States.[12] Feldman joined Harrison and Tyler, performing for colleges and once at a state penitentiary, the California Institute for Women. After Feldman was introduced as a lesbian performer during one show at Ventura College, the stage manager insisted on informing the audience that Feldman had not been invited by the college.[14]\nA record of \"Angry Atthis\" was produced by Harrison & Tyler Productions in January 1972.[16]\nFeldman worked off and on at The Back Room for Alice M. Brock, a friend.[12] Other venues included the Village Gate and the Other End, in New York City, and the Ash Grove in Los Angeles.\nIn 1974, Feldman shared the stage at the Town Hall in Manhattan with Yoko Ono. Variety magazine described the performance as a \"smashing success,\" and said Feldman \"proved an impressive spokesman for lesbians with her voice, tunes, interpretation and sense of humor.\"[12] The conservative National Review magazine, which also covered the show, described Feldman as \"Jonathan Winters in drag,\" which Feldman took as a compliment.[12]\nUnder police protection from Ku Klux Klan protesters, Feldman performed comedy at the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas. Feldman later said of the event, \"There were three hundred KKK in the audience carrying placards that read, 'Kill all dykes, kikes, commies, and abortionists,' and I was three out of four.\"[2]\nOpenly Jewish, Feldman spoke out against antisemitism in the women's movement:\n\nAs a kid, I was the only Jew on my block to keep my own nose, and in the Movement's early days, I was the only one to keep my own name. Women were changing their names if they had a 'man' ending. They said it was to deny the patriarchy, but they were also denying their Jewish identities. Feldman is a Jewish name, not a male name. When they asked why I didn't change it, I answered, 'Why don't Margie Adam and Cris Williamson change theirs?'[2]\nFeldman performed at the first Michigan Womyn's Music Festival in 1976 and returned to the festival 14 times. Feldman's womyn's anthem, \"Amazon,\" was traditionally performed during the opening festivities of the festival.[17][18] In 1986, Feldman gave the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival the rights to the song.[19]\nFeldman recorded the record album Closet Sale in 1979.[6] The album included the songs \"White Mountain Mama,\" \"Holbrook,\" \"Amazon,\" \"Closet Sale,\" \"Angry Atthis,\" \"Everywoman,\" \"Bottom Line,\" \"Objectification\" and \"Bar One.\"[20]\nFeldman's music was featured in Jan Oxenberg's 1975 film about lesbian stereotypes, A Comedy in Six Unnatural Acts.[21]\n\nDeath[edit]\nFeldman, who did not have health insurance, became ill in 1994 and died on August 17, 2007 in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the age of 61.[11]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nFeldman was recognized as one of the founders of women's music in Dee Mosbacher's 2002 documentary film, Radical Harmonies.[12]\nIn 2011, the album Amazon 35 was released in Feldman's honor, on the 35th anniversary of the song \"Amazon.\"[22] The album features the original song, along with reggae, dub, salsa and acoustic versions.[23]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Zimmerman, Bonnie, ed.

She recalls struggling with her gender as early as age five or six.[3] As a teenager, Fox believed she may have been a gay man, but learned the term transgender at the age of 17.[2] Fox continued living as a heterosexual man and married her then-girlfriend at the age of 19, when the latter became pregnant with their daughter. Fox then joined the US Navy to support her new family and served as an operations specialist on the USS Enterprise.[3]\nAfter leaving the Navy, Fox enrolled at the University of Toledo, but dropped out after ongoing psychological stress from her unresolved gender issues.[3] After leaving college, Fox worked as a truck driver in order to afford  sex reassignment surgery. She moved to Chicago, Illinois, with her daughter. In 2006, she traveled to Bangkok, Thailand, to undergo gender reassignment surgery, breast augmentation, and hair transplant surgeries at Bangkok National Hospital.[3]\n\nMixed martial arts career[edit]\nSee also: Transgender people in sports and Sex verification in sports\nFallon Fox came out as transgender on March 5, 2013 during an interview with Outsports writer Cyd Zeigler and Sports Illustrated, following her two initial professional fights in the women's division.[6][7] Controversy swelled over confusion with the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) and Florida's athletic commission over the licensing process Fox chose to complete in Coral Gables. After publications shed light on the licensing procedure and Fox's coming out many commentators brought up the issue of whether a woman who was assigned male at birth should be able to fight in women's divisions in MMA fighting.[7]\nUFC color commentator and stand-up comedian Joe Rogan opposed Fallon Fox receiving licensing, saying, \"First of all, she's not really a she. She's a transgender, post-op person. The operation doesn't shave down your bone density. It doesn't change. You look at a man's hands and you look at a woman's hands and they're built different. They're just thicker, they're stronger, your wrists are thicker, your elbows are thicker, your joints are thicker. Just the mechanical function of punching, a man can do it much harder than a woman can, period.\"[8]\nDue to controversy and the licensing procedure CFA co-founder Jorge De La Noval, who promoted Fallon's fight on March 2 in Florida, postponed Fox's April 20 fight. However, De La Noval later stated his organization will not  \"turn our backs on her... As long as she's licensed, she's always welcome in our promotion. We stand behind her and we give her all of our support.\"[3] Fox claimed in her video interview with Cyd Zeigler to be within the rules of organizations like the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for postoperative transsexuals and wishes to continue fighting in MMA.[citation needed]\nOn April 8, 2013, Matt Mitrione, in an appearance on The MMA Hour, said that Fox was \"still a man\", and called Fox an \"embarrassment\" and a \"lying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak\". UFC \"was appalled by the transphobic comments\" he made,[9] and, referring to itself as \"a friend and ally of the LGBT community\", immediately suspended Mitrione,[10] and fined him an undisclosed amount.[11] The next day Fox issued a response stating that Mitrione \"personally attacked me as a fighter, as a woman, and as a human being\".[12]\nWhether or not Fox possesses an advantage over cisgender female fighters was a topic on the April 2014 edition of HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.[13]\nIn an interview with the New York Post, former UFC women's bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey stated she would be willing to fight Fox, saying \"I can knock out anyone in the world\",[14] although she believes Fox has male bone density and structure, leading to an unfair advantage.[15] In an interview with Out, Rousey said: \"I feel like if you go through puberty as a 'man' it's not something you can reverse. ... There's no undo button on that.\"[16] UFC president Dana White claimed that \"bone structure is different, hands are bigger, jaw is bigger, everything is bigger\" and said \"I don't think someone who used to be a man and became a woman should be able to fight a woman.\"[17]\nDuring Fox's fight against Tamikka Brents, Brents suffered a concussion, an orbital bone fracture, and seven staples to the head in the 1st round. After her loss, Brents took to social media to convey her thoughts on the experience of fighting Fox: \"I've fought a lot of women and have never felt the strength that I felt in a fight as I did that night. I can't answer whether it's because she was born a man or not because I'm not a doctor. I can only say, I've never felt so overpowered ever in my life and I am an abnormally strong female in my own right,\" she stated. \"Her grip was different, I could usually move around in the clinch against other females but couldn't move at all in Fox's clinch...\"[18]\nEric Vilain, the director of the Institute For Society And Genetics at UCLA, worked with the Association of Boxing Commissions when they wrote their policy on transgender athletes. He stated in Time magazine that \"Male to female transsexuals have significantly less muscle strength and bone density, and higher fat mass, than males\"[11] and said that, to be licensed, transgender female fighters must undergo complete \"surgical anatomical changes ..., including external genitalia and gonadectomy and subsequently a minimum of two years of hormone replacement therapy, administered by a board certified specialist. In general concurrence with peer-reviewed scientific literature,[19] he states this to be \"the current understanding of the minimum amount of time necessary to obviate male hormone gender related advantages in sports competition\". Vilain reviewed Fox's medical records and said she has \"clearly fulfilled all conditions.\"[2] When asked if Fox could, nonetheless, be stronger than her competitors, Vilain replied that it was possible, but noted that \"sports is made up of competitors who, by definition, have advantages for all kinds of genetics  reasons\".[11] Fox herself responded to the controversy with an analogy comparing herself to Jackie Robinson in a guest editorial for a UFC and MMA news website:[20]\n\n Has anybody ever watched the movie 42? Remember when commentators said Jackie Robinson had an unfair advantage because black people had \"larger heel bones\" than the white men he was competing with? Are we repeating history yet again with bogus bone claims? Can we couple these bogus claims with Rogan's horrible language that was aimed at me from the video I put out last week? I'm a transgender woman. I deserve equal treatment and respect to other types of women. I feel that all of this is so ridiculously unnecessary and horribly mean spirited.\nThe documentary Game Face provides an inside look into Fox's life during the beginning of her MMA controversy.[21]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nFox was raised by devout Christians but has become an atheist.[22]\n\nMixed martial arts record[edit]\n\n\nProfessional record breakdown\n\n\n\n\n6\u00a0matches\n\n5 wins\n\n1 loss\n\n\nBy knockout\n\n3\n\n1\n\n\nBy submission\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\nBy decision\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nRes.\n\nRecord\n\nOpponent\n\nMethod\n\nEvent\n\nDate\n\nRound\n\nTime\n\nLocation\n\nNotes\n\n\nWin\n\n5\u20131\n\nTamikka Brents\n\nTKO (punches)\n\nCCCW: The Undertaking\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\n1\n\n2:17\n\nSpringfield, Illinois, United States\n\n\n\n\nWin\n\n4\u20131\n\nHeather Bassett\n\nSubmission (armbar)\n\nXtreme Fighting Organization 50\n\nMarch 21, 2014\n\n2\n\n0:44\n\nChicago, Illinois, United States\n\n\n\n\nLoss\n\n3\u20131\n\nAshlee Evans-Smith\n\nTKO (punches)\n\nCFA 12\n\nOctober 12, 2013\n\n3\n\n4:15\n\nCoral Gables, Florida, United States\n\nWomen's Featherweight Tournament Final\n\n\nWin\n\n3\u20130\n\nAllanna Jones\n\nSubmission (shin choke)\n\nCFA 11: Kyle vs. Wiuff 2\n\nMay 24, 2013\n\n3\n\n3:36\n\nCoral Gables, Florida, United States\n\n\n\n\nWin\n\n2\u20130\n\nEricka Newsome\n\nKO (knee)\n\nCFA 10: McSweeney vs. Staring\n\nMarch 2, 2013\n\n1\n\n0:39\n\nCoral Gables, Florida, United States\n\nWomen's Featherweight Tournament Semifinal\n\n\nWin\n\n1\u20130\n\nElisha Helsper\n\nTKO (injury)\n\nKOTC Wild Card\n\nMay 17, 2012\n\n1\n\n2:00\n\nWorley, Idaho, United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmateur record breakdown\n\n\n\n\n1\u00a0match\n\n1 win\n\n0 losses\n\n\nBy submission\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nRes.\n\nRecord\n\nOpponent\n\nMethod\n\nEvent\n\nDate\n\nRound\n\nTime\n\nLocation\n\nNotes\n\n\nWin\n\n1\u20130\n\nRickie Gomes\n\nSubmission (armbar)\n\nRocktown Showdown 12\n\nJune 10, 2011\n\n1\n\n2:27\n\nRockford, Illinois, United States\n\n\n\nAwards[edit]\nIn 2014, Fox was inducted into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame.[23]\n\nSee also[edit]\nPatricio Manuel, the first transgender professional boxer in the United States\nParinya Charoenphol, Thai boxer and kathoey\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Fallon \"The Queen of Swords\" Fox\".

In 1992 Foy had sex reassignment surgery, and began a 20-year battle to have her birth certificate reflect her gender identity. In 2007 the Irish High Court ruled that the relevant portions of the law of the Republic of Ireland were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but by February 2013 the law had not been changed and she began new legal proceedings to enforce the 2007 decision. As of 15 July 2015, Ireland has passed the Gender Recognition Bill 2014.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and marriage\n2 Gender confirmation\n3 First court case\n4 Second court case\n5 Effect on law\n6 Government challenge\n7 Third court case\n8 Other achievements\n9 See also\n10 References\n\n\nEarly life and marriage[edit]\nFoy is a retired dentist from Athy, County Kildare. Born in a private nursing home in the Irish Midlands,[2][3] Foy had five brothers and one sister.[4]\nFrom early childhood Foy was conscious of a feeling of \u2018femininity\u2019. This continued throughout boarding school at Clongowes Wood College from 1960 to 1965. Having obtained the Leaving Certificate, Foy started pre-med studies at University College Dublin, but changed to dentistry a year later. Foy graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Dental Surgery in 1971, and began to practice as a dentist.[4]\nIn 1975, when living in Athlone, Foy met Anne Naughton through a music society. Naughton was a secretary from Clara, County Offaly, who was eight years younger.[3] They got engaged, and married at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Horseleap[3] on 28 September 1977.[4] They had two children, one born in 1978, and the other in 1980.[4]\n\nGender confirmation[edit]\nIn the 1980s Foy began to suffer physical and psychological problems, which worsened in August and September 1989, when she suffered a total collapse. She had psychiatric counselling,[5] was diagnosed a transsexual and was prescribed a course of hormone treatment. Foy attended two further psychiatrists in England who diagnosed her as suffering from gender dysphoria.[4]\nFoy then began a process of transitioning from male to female, with electrolysis, breast augmentation surgery, operations on the nose and Adams apple[4] and voice surgery.[5] On 25 July 1992, Foy underwent full, irreversible gender confirmation surgery[4] in Brighton,[3] England. This involved the removal of some external and internal genital tissues and surgical reconstruction of a vulva.[5] The Irish Eastern Health Board paid \u00a33,000 towards the cost of the procedure.[5]\nSubsequently, Foy lived entirely as a female. She had left the family home in 1990, and a judicial separation was granted on 13 December 1991. While Foy was at first granted conditional access to the children, who lived in custody of their mother, in May 1994 the Circuit Court prohibited all access.[4]\nWhile Foy, who legally changed her first names in November 1993, was able to obtain passport, driving license, medical card, and polling card in the new name, her request to amend the sex on her birth certificate was refused.[5][6]\n\nFirst court case[edit]\nFoy v An t-Ard Chl\u00e1raitheoirCourtHigh Court of IrelandFull case nameFoy -v- An t-Ard Chl\u00e1raitheoir, Ireland and the Attorney General Decided19 October 2007Citation(s)[2007] IEHC 470Case historyPrior action(s)Foy v. An t-Ard Chlaraitheoir & Ors [2002] IEHC 116Court membershipJudge(s) sittingLiam McKechnie\nFoy began legal proceedings in April 1997,[7] to challenge the refusal of the Registrar General to issue her with a new birth certificate. Unemployed, Foy was represented in the action by Free Legal Advice Centres. The basis of her action was a contention that the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act 1863 did not justify the practice of using solely biological indicators existing at the time of birth to determine sex for the purposes of registration.[8] According to Foy, she had been born a \"congenitally disabled woman\" and the error recording her sex on her birth certificate was not only embarrassing to her but also could interfere with her constitutional rights, as she would be unable to ever choose to marry a man.[8]\nThe case reached the High Court in October 2000. Foy's former wife and their daughters contested her plea, claiming that it could have \"an adverse effect on their succession and other rights.\"[2]\nJudgment was reserved for nearly two years until 9 July 2002 when Mr Justice Liam McKechnie rejected Lydia Foy's challenge, stating that Foy had been born male based on medical and scientific evidence and that accordingly the registration could not be changed. He did express concern about the position of transsexuals in Ireland, however, and called on the government to urgently review the matter.[2][9][10]\n\nSecond court case[edit]\nSee also: Goodwin & I v United Kingdom and Christine Goodwin\nJust two days after the decision against Foy, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg heard a similar case (Goodwin & I v United Kingdom). Christine Goodwin, a British transsexual, had claimed that the United Kingdom's refusal to allow her to amend her birth certificate and to marry as a female violated the European Convention on Human Rights.[11]  The Court declared that the UK Government had violated Article 8 and Article 12 of the convention.[12]  In response, Britain passed the Gender Recognition Act 2004, providing for legal recognition of transgender persons in their new or acquired gender, and for the issuing of new birth certificates reflecting that gender.[7]\nIn 2005, the Foy case was sent  back before the High Court by the Irish Supreme Court for further consideration.[13] In the interim Ireland had passed the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 to give greater effect to the European Convention on Human Rights in Irish law. Relying on this, Foy made another application for a new birth certificate in November 2005 and when this was rejected, she issued new legal proceedings in the High Court in January 2006, referring to the Goodwin decision by the European Court of Human Rights. These proceedings were consolidated with the earlier case and the matter was heard again by Mr Justice McKechnie.[14] On 19 October 2007, the court found Ireland in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, and decided to issue the first declaration of  incompatibility between Irish and European law. According to Justice Liam McKechnie, provisions of Article 8 of the Convention protecting Foy's right to respect for private life had been violated when the State failed \"to provide for 'meaningful recognition' of her female identity\". He also expressed frustration at the Irish government's failure to take any steps to improve the position of transsexuals following his previous judgment in 2002.[15][16][17]\n\nEffect on law[edit]\nAlthough the issues have been raised in parliamentary debate,[18][19] no ruling has been made. The declaration of incompatibility cannot override domestic law, but does place an onus on the government to reconcile Irish and European legislation.[20]\nOn 5 January 2009, Thomas Hammarberg, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, stated with respect to the transgender community and specifically Foy that \"There is no excuse for not immediately granting this community their full and unconditional human rights.\"[21]\n\nGovernment challenge[edit]\nInitially challenging the 2007 ruling, on 21 June 2010 the Irish Government withdrew its appeal and set up an inter-departmental committee on the legal recognition of transsexuals.[22] The report of this Gender Recognition Advisory Group was published in July 2011 and recommended legislation to recognise transsexuals.[23] Launching the report, the then Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said the government would introduce gender recognition legislation as soon as possible,[24] but by February 2013 no legislation had been introduced.\n\nThird court case[edit]\nOn 27 February 2013 Free Legal Advice Centres, representing Lydia Foy, announced that she had issued new proceedings in the Irish High Court seeking orders requiring the government to act on the judgment of Mr Justice McKechnie in 2007 and enable her to obtain a new birth certificate recognising her female gender.[25]\n\nOther achievements[edit]\nIn 1997, Lydia grew the world's largest foxglove in her garden.[26]\nIn 2011, she was the subject of a documentary on RT\u00c9 Radio 1 called My name is Lydia Foy.\n[27]\n\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT rights in the Republic of Ireland\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Legal Gender Recognition in Ireland\u00a0: Gender Recognition\u00a0: TENI\". www.teni.ie.

Frye is the first openly transgender judge appointed in the United States.[1][2][3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Career\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nPhyllis Frye, born circa 1946, is a transgender woman. She was born in San Antonio, Texas.[4]\nIn her younger years, she was an active Eagle Scout, and was a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps.[5] Frye attended Texas A&M University[6]  where she graduated with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.[7] While at Texas A&M, Frye was a member of the University's Corps of Cadets,[5] belonged to the Texas A&M Singing Cadets.[8]\nFrye joined the United States Army and post graduation at Texas A&M she was stationed in West Germany as a Lieutenant. Frye disclosed her struggles with her sexual identity to her Army superiors where they sent her back to the United States with an effort to be \u201ccured\u201d. These efforts included drug therapy, hypnosis, and aversion therapy. When these attempts all failed her wife filed for divorce.[9] She was honorably discharged from the Army in 1972 after being forced to resign.\nAfter her discharge from the Army she hit a low point in her life and attempted suicide.[10] She used this event to turn her life around. She began working as a civil engineer, became a born-again Christian, and also met her second wife, Trish.\nFrye held a job at Texas A&M University, but was dismissed after rumors made their way to her department chairman.[9] She and her wife moved to Pennsylvania for a short time and where she found a new job.[9] In 1977 she was rejected from a government job due to her \u201cdisruptive influence in her community\u201d.[9]\nShe transitioned in 1976 around the age of 30, electing some medical procedures and foregoing others. Around this time she also won the right to amend her birth certificate.[9]\nFry earned an M.B.A. and J.D. from the University of Houston.[7]  She found herself felt completely isolated so she requested seating charts for all her classes and memorized her classmates' names and approached them individually. During her time at the University of Houston she joined the Christian Legal Society - but eventually got the group suspended for discrimination because they were secretly meeting to avoid letting her be involved. While at law school she underwent feminizing hormone therapy and electrolysis leaving her going through substantial physical changes.\nAfter graduation, Frye could not find a firm that would hire her, so she sold Amway cleaning products and worked sporadically as an engineering consultant. She took an interest in criminal defense and became a recognizable fixture in the Harris County Courthouse.[9]\nFrye politically aligns as a Democrat and was active with the state Democrats, the League of Women Voters, and the local gay and lesbian caucus - where she developed a working relationship with Annise Parker. Parker and Frye had been friends for three decades, having met on a lesbian softball league.[11] and Frye became the first transgender woman in Houston's lesbian softball league.[9]\nFrye became the country\u2019s first openly transgender judge - after being discriminated against heavily in both a private and public sphere ranging from people vandalizing her house to refusing her jobs.[9]\n\nCareer[edit]\nFrye presented at her first Creating Change conference (trans and bisexual caucuses combined meeting) in 1995.[12]\nIn 1996 Frye became aware that the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) was not going to include the transgender population in the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). In February 1997 Frye organized a gathering of transgender people in Washington, D.C. where 20 people came and they met with the offices of 46 senators of the 49 who voted for ENDA in 1996. Their efforts seemed moot.[12]\nBy the 2000s Frye was representing more and more transgender clients in name-change and discrimination cases.\nOn November 17, 2010, Houston mayor Annise Parker appointed Frye as an Associate Judge for the City of Houston Municipal Courts.[1][2]  Her appointment was publicly opposed by the Houston Area Pastors Council and other local pastors, but Mayor Parker expressed admiration for Frye, citing the new judge's long experience as a trial attorney.[2][3]  The Houston City Council unanimously approved of her appointment.[3] On April 28, 2013, Frye was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Transgender Foundation of America.[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Wright, John (November 17, 2010). \"Phyllis Frye becomes Texas' 1st trans judge\".

Choi's participation drew mixed reactions from internet users and other contestants, but SBS officials stated that they would view it as a \"violation of human rights\" to disqualify a transgender individual whose legal sex was female.[6][9] As one of the contest's 32 finalists, Choi automatically qualified as a professional model.[5] Despite this, Choi claims to have faced discrimination in the modelling industry, having been refused participation in a fashion show without any clear reason.[2] Since taking part in Super Model Contest, Choi has appeared on a number of television shows and has expressed a desire to become an actress.

Assigned male at birth, Harisu identified as female from early childhood, and underwent sex reassignment surgery in the 1990s. She is the Republic of Korea's first transgender entertainer, and in 2002 became the second person in Korea to legally change their gender. Her stage name is an adaptation of the English phrase \"hot issue\".\nHarisu first gained public attention in 2001, after appearing in a television commercial for DoDo cosmetics. The commercial was a success and marked the launch of her career, which allowed her to branch out into other fields such as music and acting. She has recorded five Korean musical albums, switching genres between techno and R&B, and her overseas releases have featured songs recorded in Mandarin. Her first major acting role was in the 2001 film Yellow Hair 2, and since then her credits have included Hi! Honey, a Taiwanese drama series, and Colour Blossoms, an erotic drama by Hong Kong filmmaker Yonfan. On May 19, 2007, Harisu married Micky Jung, however the couple divorced in 2017.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and transition\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Debut\n2.2 2003\u20132005\n2.3 2006\u2013present\n\n\n3 Personal life\n\n3.1 Legal recognition of gender\n3.2 Marriage\n3.3 Welfare and politics\n\n\n4 Discography\n\n4.1 Studio albums\n4.2 Other releases\n4.3 Music videos\n\n\n5 Filmography\n6 Bibliography\n7 Awards\n8 See also\n9 Notes\n10 References\n11 External links\n\n\nEarly life and transition[edit]\nHarisu was born Lee Kyung-yeop in Seongnam, Korea, and is one of five children.[1][a] Although assigned male at birth, she identified as female from an early age,[1] recalling, \"I was always a girl who loved playing with dolls.\"[2] This did not go unnoticed by her family or school friends, who often remarked that she looked and acted like a girl.[1][3] A failed relationship with a boy during her teenage years convinced Harisu of the need to change her sex,[3][4] and by the time she graduated from the all-boys Naksaeng High School,[5] she was already undergoing hormone replacement therapy.[6] It was for this reason that she was exempted from the military service usually required of males in the Republic of Korea, being rejected on the grounds of \"mental illness\".[6][7] By the end of the 1990s, Harisu had undergone several surgeries in Korea and Japan including: breast augmentation, sex reassignment surgery, rhinoplasty, and surgery to increase the size of her hips.[1][b]\nHarisu lived in Japan for several years, where she studied to be a hair stylist.[1][7] It was while working as a nightclub singer that she was discovered by a talent agency,[7][8] and soon after she began her career as a model.[1][9] After returning to Korea in 2000,[1] she signed with management company TTM Entertainment, and first began using the stage name \"Harisu\", derived from the English phrase \"hot issue\".[9][10][c]\n\nCareer[edit]\nDebut[edit]\n Harisu first gained public attention when she appeared in this TV commercial for DoDo cosmetics. The appearance of an Adam's apple was added digitally.\nHarisu made her acting debut in 1991\u2014while still living as a boy\u2014as a supporting actor in a high school TV drama series,[11] and this was followed by other minor film and TV roles as an extra during the 1990s.[12]\nHer big break came in early 2001, when she appeared in a TV commercial for DoDo cosmetics. The commercial hinted at the fact she is transgender, zooming in to reveal her Adam's apple (although this was added digitally, since Harisu herself does not have a prominent Adam's apple).[2][7] DoDo were initially cautious about using the commercial and had been prepared to withdraw it if the response was negative, but the commercial turned out to be a big success and quickly established her as a celebrity. As the Republic of Korea's first transgender entertainer, there was a great deal of media interest in Harisu, and she was routinely described as being \"more beautiful than a woman\".[7][13] Explaining her reasons for \"coming out\", she said, \"I don't want to face people dishonestly. I won't be able to hide it after all. It's better to make it clear from the start.\"[13] In June 2001, Harisu was the subject of a television documentary produced by KBS, which covered her childhood, family relationships, and debut as an entertainer.[4]\nLater that year she was cast in the film Yellow Hair 2, her first leading role. In addition to contributing songs for the film's soundtrack, Harisu played a transsexual who goes on the run after the apparent death of a convenience store owner. Regarding her decision to appear in the film, she said, \"I wanted to break the stereotype of transsexuals \u2014 the demureness and extreme weakness with which they are often portrayed.\"[6] The film was released on July 21.\nAlso in 2001, Harisu published her autobiography, Eve from Adam, and appeared in a music video for dance group Turbo. In September, she entered the K-pop music scene with her debut album, Temptation, a mix of techno-style pop music and slow ballads, which peaked at number 32 on the MIAK (Music Industry Association of Korea) K-pop albums chart.[14] She released her second album, Liar, in October 2002, describing it as \"a high-energy dance record with a very upbeat rhythm.\"[7] Liar became her biggest domestic chart success, reaching number 23 in its first month of release.[15]\n\n2003\u20132005[edit]\nIn October 2003, Harisu made the decision to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment. However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists.[10] The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G&F Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career.[16] In February she released her third album, Foxy Lady, which marked a change from the sound of her previous albums towards a more hip-hop/R&B style,[7] with Harisu saying \"now I am on my own, and showing my true colors, doing exactly the kind of music that I've always wanted.\"[16] The album, however, failed to make the top 50 in the Korean charts.\nIn 2004, Harisu began to develop her career overseas, expressing frustration at being \"pigeon-holed\" as a transsexual in Korea. She starred in the Taiwanese drama series Hi! Honey alongside local celebrity Pace Wu, despite not being fluent in Mandarin (her lines were spoken in Korean and later dubbed).[16] She drew attention by promoting sanitary napkins in a series of advertisements for Taiwanese company UFT, for which she was paid an estimated \u20a9100 million per ad. Although she had been initially reluctant to take on the project, observers hailed the casting of a trans woman in such a campaign as a sign of progress.[17][18] Towards the end of the year Harisu appeared in Yonfan's Colour Blossoms, an erotic drama film from Hong Kong in which she shared a role with veteran Japanese actress Keiko Matsuzaka. Released on October 18, 2004, it was poorly received at the box office and by the media, though it had some success at film festivals, and picked up several awards and nominations.[19]\nHarisu made a return to Korean screens in early 2005, after being cast in the MBC miniseries Beating Heart, her first major role in a Korean drama. She starred in several episodes as a transsexual woman, returning to her family after a lengthy absence in a bid to gain acceptance.[20] Later that year her Foxy Lady album was released in Taiwan and China with the inclusion of songs re-recorded in Mandarin, and she was even promoted by her Taiwanese record label as the \"Kylie Minogue of the East\".[9] In September 2005, Harisu gained a foothold in Malaysia after signing a three-year memorandum of understanding with Hock Star Entertainment, a deal which included the production of two feature films and secured the Malaysian release of her album.[9][21]\n\n2006\u2013present[edit]\nAfter a prolonged absence from the Korean music scene, Harisu returned in January 2006 with her fourth, self-titled album. Although her comeback was originally scheduled for the summer of 2005, this had been prevented by other commitments overseas. The album was preceded by a digital single, \"Winter Story\",[d] and marked a change in her image, with an emphasis on being \"cute\" rather than \"sexy\".[22] Harisu charted at number 46 in Korea,[23] and as with her previous album it was released in Taiwan and China with extra songs recorded in Mandarin. Her fifth Korean album, Summer, was released just six months later, though it failed to chart in the top 50.\nHer next film\u2014the first as part of the deal with Hock Star Entertainment\u2014was Possessed, a Malaysian horror film released on November 30, 2006, in which she starred alongside Amber Chia. Harisu played Lisu, a murdered pop singer who becomes a vengeful ghost, and also performed the films theme song, though it was necessary for her dialogue to be spoken in Korean and later dubbed. She was praised by director Bjarne Wong for her hard work and professionalism, and has hinted that they may collaborate on another film in the future.[24][25]\nIn early 2007, Harisu was cast as the lead actress in Police Line, a Korean drama series produced for cable network On-Media. The series, based around a special unit for victims of sexual abuse, starred Harisu as a policewoman who was molested as a child by her stepfather.[26][27] Filming for Police Line began in April 2007, and the series was launched in June with Harisu's husband Micky Jung making a cameo appearance.[28] In December 2007, Harisu released a digital mini-album, Winter Special, which featured a duet with her husband on the track \"First Snow\".[29]\nHarisu published a collection of essays in Japan in March 2008, titled Haris Beauty (sic). The essays formed a comprehensive guide to beauty, diet and fashion, and contained photographs of Harisu taken by Yamagishi Shin, who had traveled to Seoul the previous December for a four-day photo shoot.[30] Harisu also provided narration for the visually impaired for the 2008 film If You Were Me: Anima Version 2, an animated film about human rights.[31]\nAs of 2008, Harisu believed that she still faced discrimination within the entertainment industry, saying on television, \"Many people pretend to smile and welcome me, but after the filming, they'd scold me behind my back\".[29]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nHarisu's decision to undergo sex reassignment surgery placed a strain on her relationship with her family, and she noted that when her parents first found out they \"were very upset. They weren't angry, but very sad.\"[3][e] Her father in particular had great difficulty accepting his child as a daughter, but her family have since accepted this and show great pride in her career.[4][7]\nHarisu has been given credit for raising social awareness of transgender people in the Republic of Korea,[32] and has said in interviews that she hopes to be a role model for other trans people.[11] In April 2007, she came to the aid of a Chinese trans woman unable to afford surgery, giving her the financial support needed to complete her transition.[33] Affected by the 2008 suicides of gay actor Kim Ji-hoo and transgender television personality Jang Chae-won, Harisu opened transgender club \"Mix-Trans\" in Apgujeong-dong, southern Seoul, in June 2009.[34]\n\nLegal recognition of gender[edit]\nOn November 29, 2002, Harisu filed a petition with the Incheon District Court to have her sex corrected on her family register, and that her birth name be changed from Lee Kyung-yeop to the more feminine Lee Kyung-eun.[35] The subsequent court ruling went in her favour, and on December 13, 2002, she became the second person in the Republic of Korea to legally change their sex.[8][36][37] Speaking of the difficulties she had previously encountered, Harisu has said: \"My most embarrassing moments were when I have had to show my personal identification card in public... I couldn't get a passport, visa or even my own bank accounts because I was legally a man\".[38]\n\nMarriage[edit]\nSince her debut in 2001, Harisu has consistently expressed a desire to marry and have a family of her own.[1][7] In 2005, she began dating Micky Jung (real name Jung Yong-jin), a rapper whom she had met online.[39] Jung, who had been a member of dance group EQ during the 1990s, later joined Harisu's management company and worked on her fourth and fifth albums.[40] The couple briefly separated in 2006, but were reunited after Jung saw her dating another man on a TV show.[41] Rumours that the two were to marry began circulating in November 2006,[41] and a date for the wedding was announced in February, following meetings between their respective families.[40] Harisu and Jung starred in a reality television show on cable network Mnet showing their everyday lives and preparations for their wedding, but the couple were subjected to harsh criticism from netizens.[42][43]\nOn May 19, 2007, Harisu and Jung were married at Central City Millennium Hall in the Seocho-gu district of Seoul. The ceremony was presided over by KBS anchor Shin Young-il, and officiated by Kim Suk-kwon, a Dong-A University professor who had performed Harisu's sex change surgery in the 1990s. The couple honeymooned on the Thai island of Ko Samui, and began their married life at Harisu's family home in Nonhyun-dong, in the Gangnam-gu district of Seoul. The couple have said that they plan to adopt four children,[39] though the news prompted a mixed public reaction. A poll by Mnet found that 69% of 1,300 respondents were in favour of Harisu's decision to adopt, while in a similar poll by Daum, 58% of 8,094 respondents were against the idea.[42] Harisu and Jung divorced in 2017 after ten years of marriage.[44][45]\n\nWelfare and politics[edit]\nIn November 2007, Harisu unveiled plans to build and run an orphanage, stating that it was one of her \"long-cherished dreams\". With the support of her husband and mother-in-law, she purchased a 3,300\u00a0m2 (3,900\u00a0sq\u00a0yd) plot of land in Janghowon, Gyeonggi-do, and studied for a community service license.[46] Harisu campaigned for the New Progressive Party in the 2008 Republic of Korea legislative elections, supporting the legalization of marijuana.[47]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAs of 2007, Harisu has released five Korean language studio albums, though her song lyrics typically include English as well. While her early work has been described as \"techno-flavored K-pop\", her more recent albums have leaned towards the R&B, hip-hop and disco genres. She has named Madonna and Janet Jackson as her musical influences; of her contemporaries she holds Chae Rina in high esteem.[7]\n\nStudio albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nRelease date\n\nChart position\n\nSales\n\nNotes\n\n\nTemptation\n\nSeptember 22, 2001[48]\n\n32[14]\n\n25,474[49](as of October 2001)\n\nAlso released in Taiwan.\n\n\nLiar\n\nOctober 28, 2002[48]\n\n23[15]\n\n15,760[15](as of October 2002)\n\n\n\n\nFoxy Lady\n\nFebruary 2, 2004[48]\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nReleased in Taiwan, China and Malaysia in 2005, with extra tracks recorded in Mandarin.\n\n\nHarisu\n\nJanuary 24, 2006[48]\n\n46[23]\n\n1,596[23](as of January 2006)\n\nAlso released in Taiwan and China, with extra tracks recorded in Mandarin.\n\n\nSummer\n\nJuly 25, 2006[48]\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nOther releases[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nRelease date\n\nNotes\n\n\nYellow Hair 2 OST\n\nJuly 23, 2001[48]\n\nFilm soundtrack by various artists; includes two songs by Harisu, \"Paradise\" and \"Sad Love\".\n\n\nThe First Live Concert\n\nJuly 29, 2002[50]\n\nLive concert, released on VHS and VCD.\n\n\nDance Fever #01\n\nJune 12, 2003[50]\n\nCompilation by various artists; includes Harisu's version of \"The Cheeky Song\", originally recorded by The Cheeky Girls.\n\n\n\"Winter Story\"\n\nDecember 5, 2005[50]\n\nDigital single, taken from the album Harisu.\n\n\nWinter Special\n\nDecember 6, 2007[48]\n\nFive track digital mini-album; includes a Korean language version of \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\".\n\nMusic videos[edit]\n\"History\" by Turbo (2001)\n\"Temptation\" (2001)\n\"Always\" by Kang Sung (2002)\n\"Liar\" (2002)\n\"Foxy Lady\" (2004)\n\"Reaction\" (2006)\n\"Shopping Girl\" (2012)\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2001\n\nYellow Hair 2\n\nJ\n\nAlso performed two songs on the soundtrack.\n\n\n2002\n\nCity Horror Series (TV)\n\nGeneral Bai Lan\n\nAppeared in \"The Song of the Dead\".\n\n\nEmergency Act 19\n\nHerself\n\nBrief cameo appearance.\n\n\n2004\n\nHi!

While stationed in Pensacola, Florida, Hartin married, and the couple had a daughter in 1955. The marriage led to a separation in 1957, and after moving to Casablanca in 1966, Hartin transitioned in 1970. Her divorce that year made headlines, one of the first publicized divorces due to transition.\nIn 1971, Hartin brought suit against The Bureau of Records and Statistics within the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for refusing to update her sex designation on her birth certificate. Under pressure to accommodate trans citizens, the Bureau had voted unanimously to omit a sex designation from the amended birth certificates of transsexual people. Hartin\u2019s suit Deborah Hartin v. Director of the Bureau of Records and Statistics was dismissed in 1973.[5]\nHartin told reporters she planned to convert to Judaism in 1976.[6] Soon after, she stopped making media appearances.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Lamparski, Richard (August 21, 1971).

As a child she was known for her knowledge of antiques, appearing on numerous television shows including After Dark and Wogan.[3] In later life, she is known for her appearances on television series such as Celebrity Big Brother, Big Brother's Bit on the Side and This Morning.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Early career\n3 Later career\n4 Personal life\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nHarries' father, Mark Harries, worked in the hotel business and catering trade.[4] The family moved to Cardiff when Harries was still a baby. From the age of five, she enjoyed art and antiques, and had an apparent ability to spot bargains at local jumble sales and second-hand shops.\n\nEarly career[edit]\n Harries appearing on After Dark on 23 March 1991, aged 13\nHarries began making television appearances in August 1988 on Terry Wogan's chat show,[2] Wogan. The then ten-year-old[2] demonstrated a good knowledge of antiques. At 13, she wrote an antique guide, Rags to Riches.[5][6]\n\nLater career[edit]\nIn 2004, after Harries had undergone gender reassignment, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary Little Lady Fauntleroy made by actor Keith Allen in which he interviewed the Harries family.[7] The documentary was released on DVD on 4 July 2005. In October 2006, Harries appeared in the Channel 5 television series Trust Me \u2013 I'm a Beauty Therapist,[8] which was filmed on location in a beauty therapist's in Swansea, Wales. In November 2008, Harries was featured as a cover girl in the specialist lifestyle magazine Transliving.[9]\nIn August 2013, Harries became a housemate on the twelfth series of Celebrity Big Brother.[10] She finished in third place.[11] In September 2013, she appeared on Celebrity Juice.[12] Her debut single \"I Am a Woman\" was released in January 2015.[13] Harries released a follow-up single, \"Upadoo\" in May 2018. In August 2019, Harries made an appearance on the Channel 4 dating series Naked Attraction.[14]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nHarries' schooling suffered from the heightened publicity. By the age of 14, Harries suffered depression and agoraphobia, which led to a nervous breakdown and suicide attempt.[15] Media opportunities and resulting business reduced as Harries grew up.[4] In the recession of the early 1990s, the family's businesses failed. One family shop was destroyed by fire, and her father was convicted of insurance fraud. Harries sold some of her collections to assist in the support of the family.[4][5] Harries then took three GCSEs after home tutoring.[16]\nAs a child, Harries had been taken by her family to see a doctor because she displayed feminine mannerisms. Later, Harries decided to transition from male to female, change her name to Lauren Charlotte,[3] and investigated gender reassignment surgery, which was carried out in 2001.[2] Funding for this was generated from publicity arranged by Max Clifford.[4]\nOn 8 July 2005, a group of five to seven men attacked Harries, her father and her brother in the family home.[17] One 17-year-old boy was later fined and given a supervision order for his role in the incident.[18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Two Programmes \u2013 Where Are They Now?, Lauren Harries\".

She struggled being raised as a \"little black boy who was existentially trapped in a boy\u2019s body, but was definitely very much so female.\"[4] Before discovering that she was transgender, she thought she was gay, and dealt with suicidal thoughts as she thought being gay was a sin.[4]\nHearns was very interested in black power, and educated herself about Malcolm X and the civil rights movement.[4]  She became a youth organizer, and later attended Central State University, a historically black university in Wilberforce, Ohio.[1]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2013, Hearns co-founded the Black Lives Matter Global Network.[1] As a strategic partner and organizing coordinator, she helped develop policy for the network, including the 2016 policy platform \"A Vision for Black Lives\".[1][2][3] She co-organized a National Day of Action in 2015 to bring attention to the black trans women who were killed that year.[5]\nIn 2015, Hearns was one of the organizers of The Movement for Black Lives, a national three-day conference in Cleveland, Ohio.[6][7]\nHearns founded The Marsha P.

Johnson Institute, along with other trans activists, spoke out against an episode of The Breakfast Club radio show where remarks were made about trans women. Comedian Lil Duval joked about killing a sex partner if she turned out to be transgender, and host Charlamagne Tha God, while noting that killing a trans person was a hate crime, stated that women not disclosing their trans status were \"taking away a person's power of choice\" and \"should go to jail or something\".

A long-time veteran of the video game industry, Heineman was a founding member of video game companies Interplay Productions, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sk\u00fc\u00fcl. She has been chief executive officer for Olde Sk\u00fc\u00fcl since 2013.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 Board service\n5 Accolades\n6 Games\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nRebecca Ann Heineman (born William Salvador Heineman) was born and raised in Whittier, California.[2] When she was young, she could not afford to purchase games for her Atari 2600, so she taught herself how to copy cartridges and built herself a sizable pirated video game collection. Eventually, she became discontented with just copying games and reverse-engineered the console's code to understand how the games were made.[3] In 1980, Heineman and a friend traveled to Los Angeles to compete in a regional branch of a national Space Invaders championship. Although she did not expect to fall under the top 100 contestants, she won the competition. Later that year, she also won the championship in New York. Heineman is hence considered to be the first national video game tournament champion.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter she won the tournament, Heineman was offered a writing job for monthly magazine Electronic Games and a consultancy job for a book called How to Master Video Games. During this time, she mentioned to one magazine publisher that she had reverse-engineered Atari 2600 code, and the publisher arranged a meeting between Heineman and the owners of video game developer Avalon Hill. As she met with them, she was hired as a programmer instantaneously. Heineman, aged 16 at the time, moved across the U.S. for her new job, canceling her plans to acquire a high school diploma. At Avalon Hill, Heineman created a manual for the company's programming team, the studio's game engine, and the base code for several software projects, including her first own game, London Blitz, before leaving the company.[3]\nHeineman returned to California to work for another developer, Boone Corporation. For Boone, she programmed the games Chuck Norris Superkicks and Robin Hood, acquiring knowledge of programming for Commodore 64, Apple II, VIC-20 and IBM PCs, of video game hardware, as well as video game design. Boone ceased operations in 1983, so Heineman got together with Brian Fargo, Jay Patel and Troy Worrell, and the four founded Interplay Productions (later known as Interplay Entertainment). Heineman acted as lead programmer for the company, working on Wasteland, The Bard's Tale, Out of This World, and the Mac OS and 3DO ports of Wolfenstein 3D.[3]\nHeineman went on to design The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate, Dragon Wars, Tass Times in Tonetown, Borrowed Time, Mindshadow and The Tracer Sanction, among others, for Interplay. As the company grew to more than 500 employees, Heineman, wishing to return to her small-team roots, left the company in 1995 and co-founded Logicware, where she acted as chief technology officer and lead programmer. Aside from original games, Heineman oversaw the company's porting activities, which included Out of This World, Shattered Steel, Jazz Jackrabbit 2 and a canceled Mac OS port of Half-Life.[3]\nIn 1999, Heineman founded Contraband Entertainment, operating as its chief executive officer. The company developed several original games alongside ports to various platforms for other developers. Projects led by Heineman include Myth III: The Wolf Age and Activision Anthology, and Mac OS ports for Aliens vs. predator, Baldur's Gate II and  Heroes of Might and Magic IV. During this time, she also provided consultancy work directly for other companies: She acted as \"Senior Engineer III\" for Electronic Arts, upgraded engine code for Barking Lizards Technologies and Ubisoft, optimized code for Sensory Sweep Studios, acted as senior software architect for Bloomberg L.P. and Amazon, provided training on Xbox 360 development for Microsoft's development studios, and worked on the kernel code for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 4 at Sony. During her tenure at Amazon, Heineman was, in addition to her technological role, also the \"Transgender Chair\" of Amazon's LGBTQ+ group, known as Glamazon.[3]\nContraband was wound down in 2013, and Heineman founded a new company, Olde Sk\u00fc\u00fcl, together with Jennell Jaquays, Maurine Starkey, and Susan Manley. At Olde Sk\u00fc\u00fcl, Heineman acts as CEO.[3]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAround 2003, Heineman was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and began transitioning to a woman.[1][4] She formally changed her given name to Rebecca Ann.[1][5] Since the transition, Heineman has been living as a lesbian.[1] She has five children and is married to Jennell Jaquays.[1][6] Heineman resides in El Cerrito, California, where her company Olde Sk\u00fc\u00fcl is located.[3][7]\n\nBoard service[edit]\nHeineman has been part of the advisory board of the Video Game History Museum since 2011, and is part of the board of directors of LGBTQ+ organization GLAAD.[3]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nHeineman is recognized as the first national video game tournament champion for winning the 1980 National Space Invaders Championship.[3] Sailor Ranko, a Sailor Moon-based fanfiction comic by Heineman based on an earlier work by written by Duncan Zillman, has won multiple awards.[8][3] In 2017, she became an inductee for the International Video Game Hall of Fame.[3]\n\nGames[edit]\n\nThe Bard's Tale (1985)\nBorrowed Time (1985)\nTass Times in Tonetown (1986)\nThe Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate (1988)\nNeuromancer (1988)\nCrystal Quest (1989, Apple IIgs port)\nDragon Wars (1989)\nTrack Meet (1991)\nRPM Racing (1991)\nAnother World (1992, SNES port)\nRescue Rover (1993, Apple IIgs port)\nInterplay's 10 Year Anthology: Classic Collection (1993)\nUltima I: The First Age of Darkness (1994, Apple IIgs port)\nWolfenstein 3D (1995, Mac/3DO ports)\nKingdom: The Far Reaches (1995)\nKilling Time (1996)\nDoom (1996, 3DO port)\nDefiance (1997)\nTempest 2000 (1998, Mac port)\nRemington Top Shot: Interactive Target Shooting (1998)\nRedneck Rampage (1999, Mac port)\nJazz Jackrabbit 2 (1999, Mac port)\nGalactic Patrol (1999, Mac port)\nBugdom (1999)\nMyth III: The Wolf Age (2001)\nBaldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2001, Mac port)\nNanosaur Extreme (2002)\nIcewind Dale (2002, Mac port)\nHexen II (2002, Mac port)\nActivision Anthology (2002)\nMedal of Honor: Rising Sun (2003)\nPitfall: The Lost Expedition (2004)\nMedal of Honor: Pacific Assault (2004)\nGoldenEye: Rogue Agent (2004)\nMedal of Honor: European Assault (2005)\nCommand & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars (2007)\nAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007)\nChip's Challenge (2015, Windows re-release)\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nBiography portal\nVideo games portal\nList of programmers\nList of women in the video game industry\nWomen and video games\nWomen in computing\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e Barton, Matt (December 27, 2010). \"The Burger Speaks: An Interview With An Archmage, Page 1 of 7\".

Herbst became the first openly transgender mayor in Texas in 2016 when the then-mayor suffered a heart attack and died days before the election, but still won, leaving the town without a mayor. Herbst, who was Mayor pro-tem, was then appointed to the position.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Politics\n\n1.1 Bathroom bill opposition\n\n\n2 Transition\n3 Personal life\n4 References\n\n\nPolitics[edit]\nHerbst has lived in New Hope, Texas, since 1999. She previously served as alderman, road commissioner and mayor pro-tem. Herbst became mayor of the town, which has an aldermanic form of government, in May 2016 after the previous mayor died while seeking reelection.[3] In an open letter to the town residents, Herbst came out as transgender on January 23, 2017.[4] Herbst states the reaction to her coming out has been \"overwhelmingly positive.\"[5]\nResidents in the tiny town of New Hope voted out Mayor Jess Herbst on Saturday, May 5, 2018, preventing her from becoming the first openly transgender elected official in Texas. Herbst lost to Angel Hamm, the widow of the former mayor. Melissa Brown finished second in the race.\n\nBathroom bill opposition[edit]\nIn January 2017, Herbst criticized Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick for supporting the controversial \"bathroom bill\", which would require Texas residents to use bathrooms according to their sex designation on their birth certificate. Herbst wrote \"Mr. Patrick: Let me get this straight, are you saying that right now, without your bill being passed, anyone can assault someone in the bathroom without breaking the law? That's some kind of weird screwed-up loophole if so.\"[6]\nShe testified before the Texas Senate committee on State affairs against House Bill 6, also known as the Bathroom bill. The committee heard from over 1500 citizens who voiced 85% opposition to the bill. In spite of this they passed to bill on to the full senate which then passed it with little debate.\nHerbst returned to testify in the house hearing, waiting until 3:15am to give her testimony. Again the testimony was greater than 85% against. The House committee on State Affairs declined to vote, thus allowing the bill to die.\nTexas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick orchestrated a plan to force the issue by blocking critical spending legislation, thus forcing a special session.\nIn July 2017 at a cost of an estimated $1 million to Texas tax payers, the special session convened. Herbst was an active participant in One Texas Resistance, a broad coalition of human rights organizations and grassroot activists. One Texas Resistance organized protests every day of the session, objecting to anti-immigration, anti-adoption, anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ and other bills encroaching human rights.\nThe process began as in the regular session with the Senate Committee on State Affairs again holding a hearing. Herbst testified first in a full day of testimony, followed third by Ashley Smith, the transgender architect who posted the famous photo of herself with Governor Greg Abbott. Testimony this time was 93% against. The Committee passed the bill as expected and a few days later the Senate took up the debate, this time lasting six hours. A one-point testimony from Libby Gonzales and Mayor Herbst was read verbatim on the senate floor.\nIn the following weeks on the Capitol steps were press conferences by state law enforcement officials and business and religious leaders stating their opposition to the bathroom bill. The House, lead by a staunch opponent and House Speaker Joe Straus III, declined to give the bill consideration, allowing the bill to die again.\n\nTransition[edit]\nHerbst recounts being drawn to women's clothing as early as three years old.[citation needed] In 2015, Herbst  began hormone replacement therapy. Toward the end of September 2016, Herbst began living full-time as a woman.[7] In February 2017, Caitlyn Jenner, herself a transgender woman, commented on Herbst's transition. In a statement to Fortune, Jenner stated \"Everyone's journey is unique and different. I'm so happy for her.\"[1]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nHerbst attended East Texas State University. At a showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Herbst met Debbie Gray, who would eventually become her wife. Their first daughter was born in 1989, with a second daughter following 18 months later.[8] In 2018, Herbst completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow.\nThrough her transition, Herbst and her wife Debbie Gray Herbst have stayed married. They have two adult daughters.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Chan, Melissa (3 Feb 2017). \"Caitlyn Jenner Shares Message of Support for Transgender Texas Mayor: 'I'm So Happy for Her'\". Fortune.

In 1997 she moved to Hallam FM in Sheffield, her local station, where she hosted the drivetime programme for three years. She then returned to The Pulse of West Yorkshire to co-host the breakfast show with Elisa Hilton, but quickly left to take over the breakfast show at Viking FM in Hull \u2013 the one area of Yorkshire which had yet to hear her \u2013 after the departure of JK and Joel. She and her breakfast team won a Sony Award in 2002.\nHirst left 96.9 Viking FM, to take on the breakfast show (entitled Hirsty's Daily Dose) at Galaxy Yorkshire, a station covering all areas of Yorkshire. The Daily Dose team, led by Hirst, including ex-Viking colleague Danny Oakes and existing Galaxy Yorkshire presenter Joanne (Jojo) Kelly (n\u00e9e Moorhouse) won the title of Commercial Radio Presenter(s) Of The Year at the CRCA Awards, and was nominated in the breakfast category of the 2005 Sony Awards.\nAfter Neil Fox quit as the long-running host of the nationally networked Hit40UK in 2004, Hirst \u2013 one of  his stand-ins previously from 2003 \u2013 was recruited, initially with Katy Hill, to host the programme each Sunday from the studios of Capital Radio in London and went on to host the programme alone. She was up against JK and Joel on BBC Radio 1 for the chart audience on a Sunday afternoon \u2013 the presenters whom she succeeded at Viking FM and with whom she remains close friends; in fact, during her chart reign she shared a flat in London with Joel Ross. Also a spin-off TV show Hit40UK TV hosted by Hirst was broadcast on a weekend on Channel 4's youth strand T4. She won a Sony Award for the show in 2006.\nDuring Hit40uk on 2 April 2006, she announced that Gnarls Barkley had made pop history as the UK's first number one song based on download sales alone.\nHirst presented her last Hit40UK chart on 15 October 2006, due to objections from Galaxy's rival Yorkshire radio stations Viking FM, Radio Aire and Hallam FM who were due to start broadcasting the chart on 22 October 2006. They were unhappy that a Galaxy Yorkshire presenter would be heard on their station, since they could possibly lose a proportion of their breakfast audience to Hirst's weekday breakfast show.\nIn May 2013, Hirst returned to presenting nationally on Gold on Saturday afternoons between 1:00\u00a0pm and 5:00\u00a0pm, later moving to the earlier time of 12:00\u00a0pm and 4:00\u00a0pm, where she went on to create a show called 'Vinyl Heaven', with every song played live from the original vinyl copies.\nOn 20 June 2014, Hirst announced that she had left her presenting roles at Capital and Gold, which brought Hirsty's Daily Dose to an end after 11 years. 2014 also saw her collect a nomination for 'Breakfast Show of the Year' at the Radio Academy Awards (Formerly Sony Awards). The final edition had aired on 13 June. Adam O'Neill took over as the main host of the newly named Capital Breakfast with Danny and JoJo remaining co-hosts.\nIn January 2015, Hirst started work on ITV's morning show 'Lorraine' as part of a strand called 'Change One Thing'. Hirst continues to be part of ITV Lorraine's extended presenter family.\nShe made a return to radio on 4 July 2015, with a programme called, 'Nothing but the 90s' which was aired on BBC Radio Manchester from 10\u00a0pm to 12\u00a0midnight every Saturday. In a 2015 interview she said coming back to radio at a time slot which was somewhat tucked away at night and not in the limelight felt just right, so she could find her new voice without huge pressure.\nOn 5 March 2016, she started a new radio programme on BBC Radio York called 'Stephanie Hirst's Vinyl Revival'. The show aired every Saturday from 12\u00a0noon to 2\u00a0pm for 8 weeks while the usual presenter of that time slot was away on leave. She has also presented a few spin-offs of this show including a 3-hour version for Bauer's 'Greatest Hits Network' and Vinyl top 40 show for the BBC.\nAs of 3 September 2016, her weekly Saturday night show on BBC Radio Manchester changed to a \"Vinyl Revival\" show, airing at the same time from 10\u00a0pm 12\u00a0midnight. The show is the only one of its kind on UK radio, with Hirst playing each song live from the original vinyl copies, along with taking live listener requests.\nAt the Radio Festival which took place at The British Library in London on 26 October 2016, she was awarded a 'Fellowship', the highest honour The Radio Academy may confer upon a member of the radio industry, to recognise her outstanding contribution to British radio and the industry.\nIn April 2018, Hirst began hosting her own daily radio show since leaving Capital in 2014. The Stephanie Hirst Show broadcasts on BBC Radio Leeds weekdays 9:00-12:00, becoming the BBC's first presenter to daily broadcaster  who has a trans history.\nShe also is a trustee of The Radio Academy and chair of the Student Radio Awards sponsored by BBC Radio 1 and Global Radio.\n\nTransition and activism[edit]\nHirst came out publicly as a woman and talked about her gender transition on 11 October 2014 during an interview with Stephen Nolan on BBC Radio 5Live.[2][3] In 2014 and 2015 Hirst was included in The Independent On Sunday's \"Rainbow List\", an annual celebration of 101 LGBT people in the UK.[4]\nIn June 2016, she was one of the prominent faces of Pride In London's 'No Filter' campaign. The manifesto film, which starred Hirst alongside Sir Ian McKellen and Graham Norton, explored what 'No Filter' means to the LGBT+ community. A second short film was made with Hirst describing her first 'No Filter' moment and shown daily within London's Westfield centre.[citation needed] In July 2016, Hirst was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Leeds Beckett University for her LGBT activism.[3] In February 2017, Hirst was nominated for a British LGBT Award in the 'Top 10 LGBT+ Celebrity' category.[citation needed]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Halliwell, Rachel (3 July 2015). \"Stephanie Hirst: 'Why I'm returning to radio a year after transitioning from a man to a woman'\".

She paid reparations and was disqualified from driving for one month. The presiding judge also ordered that Hubbard's name be suppressed to avoid distressing publicity as she trained for the Olympics. However, the order was lifted in July 2019 after Stuff appealed to the High Court.[23]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Commonwealth Games: Transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard set to compete\".

She has released eight albums and three additional compilation albums. She was the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 in Birmingham with the song \"Diva\".\nAfter consolidating her initial commercial success with the albums Umpatampa (1994) and Maganuna (1996), she was selected in 1998 to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest with her song \"Diva\". Placing first at the international competition, she came to public attention throughout Europe.\nDana following up this success with the albums Free (1999), Yoter VeYoter (2001), HaHalom HaEfshari (2002) and Hakol Ze Letova (2007), she represented Israel in Eurovision a second time in 2011, this time with the song \"Ding Dong\", which failed to make it into the final.

She was the youngest of three children, and was named after an uncle who had been killed during a terrorist attack.\nThough assigned male at birth, she identified as female from a very young age. She wanted to become a singer from the age of eight, when she watched Israeli singer Ofra Haza perform her song \"Chai\" in the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest.[citation needed] Although the family was quite poor, her mother worked to pay for her music lessons, and she stated that her childhood was happy. She came out as transgender at the age of 13.\nDana International took her stage name from a feminized version of a childhood friend Daniel, who died in a car accident.[citation needed]\n\nCareer[edit]\n1990\u20131993: Dana International[edit]\nAt 18 years of age, Cohen (still legally male at the time) earned a living as a drag queen, parodying many famous female singers. During one of her performances, she was discovered by Offer Nissim, a well-known Israeli DJ, who produced her debut single \"Saida Sultana\" (\"The Great Saida\"), a satirical version of Whitney Houston's song \"My Name Is Not Susan\".[5] The song received considerable exposure and helped launch her career as a professional singer.[5]\nIn 1993, Dana International flew to London for male-to-female sex reassignment surgery and legally changed her name to Sharon Cohen.[6] Returning home with her new name, that same year Cohen released her first album, titled Danna International, in Israel. Soon after, the album was also released in several other countries including Greece, Jordan, and Egypt (In Jordan and Egypt the album sold illegally). Sharon's stage name Dana International comes from the title track of the album, and was originally spelled with two n's. Danna International soon became a gold record in Israel.[7]\n\n1994\u20131995 Umpatampa and Eurovision Song Contest[edit]\nIn 1994, Dana released her second, Trance-influenced album Umpatampa, which built on the success of her debut and provided further hit singles.[8] The album went platinum in Israel and has sold more than 50,000 copies to date. Because of her popularity and the success of this album, she won the award for Best Female Artist of the Year in Israel.\nIn 1995, Dana attempted to fulfill her childhood dream of performing in the Eurovision Song Contest.[9] She entered the Eurovision qualifying contest in Israel with a song entitled \"Layla Tov, Eropa\" (\"Good Night Europe\") which finished second in the pre-selections, but became another hit single.\nIn late 1995, Dana released an E.P. called E.P. Tampa with three new songs and four remixes and special versions of her earlier songs.\n\n1996\u20131998: Consolidating popularity, Diva and mainstream spotlight[edit]\nIn 1996, Dana released her third album, Maganuna. Although this album was less successful than her previous efforts, it still reached gold record sales in Israel and included the hits \"Don Quixote\", \"Menafnefet\" (Waving) and the club favorite \"Cinque Milla.\" In 1997, Dana collaborated with the Israeli artist Eran Zur on his album Ata Havera Sheli, and together they sang the duet \"Shir Kdam-Shnati (Sex Acher)\" (\"Pre-Bed Song (A Different Kind of Sex)\") which became a huge hit.[10]\nDana was chosen to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 in Birmingham with the song \"Diva\". Orthodox Jews and others with conservative views were opposed to the choice and attempted to void her participation in the contest. In May 1998, Dana performed \"Diva\" at the Eurovision final and won the contest with 172 points. She became known internationally, and was interviewed by CNN, BBC, Sky News, and MTV among others mostly focusing on her life as a transsexual person before winning the contest. Dana's own words \"the message of reconciliation\" were; \"My victory proves God is on my side. I want to send my critics a message of forgiveness and say to them: try to accept me and the kind of life I lead. I am what I am and this does not mean I don't believe in God, and I am part of the Jewish Nation.\"[11]\nDana released \"Diva\" as a single in Europe[12] and it became a hit, reaching number 11 in the UK charts and the top ten in Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, and the Netherlands.\n\n1999\u20132001: Stage falling, Streisand cover and new albums[edit]\nIn 1999, Dana released \"Woman in Love\", a Barbra Streisand cover. In May 1999, Dana again participated in the Eurovision Song Contest held in Jerusalem. Dana was a part of the interval act and sang the Stevie Wonder song \"Free\". One memorable moment from the event happened when she presented the award to the winners of the contest. Whilst she was carrying the heavy trophy, one of the composers of the winning Swedish entry stepped on the long trail of her dress by mistake, and she fell over on stage \u2013 in front of a television audience estimated be to one million or more, making it one of the most memorable moments in the 50-year-long history of the contest.\nShe released her next album Free in Europe in 1999, which enjoyed moderate success. A few months later Dana moved back to Israel and started to work on different projects. Israeli and Japanese editions of Free were released in 2000. That same year, an Israeli documentary film was made about Dana called Lady D.\nIn 2001, after a break, Dana released her seventh album Yoter Ve Yoter (More and More).[13] The album put her career in Israel back on track and provided two hits called \"Ani Nitzachti\" (I Won) and \"Achrei HaKol\" (After All), which eventually both went gold.\n\n2002\u20132007: Fading from the scene and Sony BMG incident[edit]\n Dana International became a famous singer after winning Eurovision.\nDana was about to sign with a major label, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, for an international recording contract. There were disagreements that led to Sony Music cancelling the deal before it was completed.\nIn 2002, she released another album, HaHalom HaEfshari (The Possible Dream), which was a minor chart success. In 2003, she released an exclusive 8-CD box set, containing all singles from The Possible Dream and a new house version of the hit single \"Cinque Milla\", titled A.lo.ra.lo.la.\nA few years later, in 2005, Dana participated in the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest, held in Copenhagen, after \"Diva\" was selected as one of fourteen songs considered to be the best Eurovision songs. The song did not make it into the final top five. Dana got the chance to perform both \"Diva\" and an old Eurovision favourite of hers, Baccara's 1978 entry \"Parlez-Vous Francais?\". She also recorded the song \"Lola\" (sung in French), to which she released a video. This video can be found on the CD Hakol Ze Letova, released in 2007 as a bonus CD-rom video.\n\n2007\u20132011: Return to music and Eurovision comeback[edit]\n Backing vocalists of Dana International at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011, in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.\nAfter a few years away from show business, together with the relaunch of her official website, a first single of the upcoming album was released in March 2007: \"HaKol Ze LeTova\" (\"It's All For the Best\"). The second single to be released from the album, \"Love Boy\", became the most played song on Israeli radio in a decade.[14] It also gained a respectable place on the airplay of the Greek radio station FLY FM 89,7. The following album, also titled Hakol Ze Letova, was released on 15 August 2007. \"At Mukhana\" (You Are Ready) was the third single and \"Seret Hodi\" (Indian Movie; feat. Idan Yaniv)[15] the fourth to be released from the album, which became a bestseller in many online stores. The next single released from the album was \"Yom Huledet\" (Birthday).\nOn 26 February 2008, Dana gained an additional achievement when the song \"Ke'ilu Kan\" written and composed by her and performed by Boaz Mauda, was chosen on Kdam Eurovision to represent Israel at Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, Serbia. It came 5th in the semi-final and gained 9th place in the final rank.\nDana also recorded the song \"Mifrats HaAhava\" (\"The Love Bay\") for an Israeli version of the TV-show \"Paradise Hotel\". She also collaborated with the Ukrainian duo NeAngely (Not Angels), recording \"I Need Your Love\" and releasing a video. In 2009, Dana starred in a mock reality show called Dana Kama/Nama for cellphone provider Cellcom[16]\nDana campaigned for Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni shortly before 2009 legislative elections in Israel. At a women's political rally in Jerusalem Dana performed a disco song alongside Livni onstage, announcing \"I now formally invite you to the diva sisterhood.\"[17]\nIn April 2009, Dana performed in the opening concert of Tel Aviv-Yafo Centennial Year. She performed a cover version of Danny Robas' song \"Lo Nirdemet Tel Aviv\" (Tel Aviv Doesn't Fall Asleep) in front of 250,000 people.\nAlso in 2009, Dana International joined the 7th season of \"Kokhav Nolad\" (the Israeli version of Pop Idol) as a judge, also joining the 8th one in 2010.[18] Dana made a guest appearance, as herself, in an episode of the second series of UK sitcom Beautiful People, which was set around her Eurovision appearance.\nOn 8 March 2011, Dana International won the Israeli National Final for Eurovision with the song \"Ding Dong\", and represented Israel at Eurovision for a second time. The song did not make it into the final; she was the first Eurovision winner not to do so.\n\n2013\u2013present: new singles, TV show and album[edit]\nIn April 2013, after a two-year break, Dana released a new single, \"Ma La'asot\" (What To Do). It was released digitally worldwide on 24 April 2013. On 29 May, Dana released a video clip for the song Loca, to promote the Gay Pride Tel Aviv 2013. Dana will perform on the main event for the Gay Pride on 7 June. Her third single for that year, \"Ir Shlema\" (A Whole City), was released in July. Late in January 2014, Dana's new music reality show \"Yeshnan Banot\" premiered. Dana is the main judge on the show, attempting to find Israel's next girl group.[19]\nAlso in 2014, Dana was the main attraction aboard the first Jewish boat to participate in the Amsterdam Pride Canal Parade.[20][21] Dana stated, \"I don't believe in any religion, so I\u2019m here as an Israeli, not as a Jew. But it's time to end the persecution over religion or national reasons. Just cut out all that shit. That's my message.\"[21] Previously, after she won the Eurovision song competition, a religious debate had been held as to whether, and how, Dana should pray in a synagogue, with one rabbinical authority concluding that Dana should be counted in a minyan as a man.[22] She could not sing in front of the community since she was also a woman, according to the rabbi, and that would violate the Orthodox rule of kol isha.[22]\nIn June 2017, Dana released a new single, called \"Ruti\". In August 2017 she released another single, called \"Yesh Li Ahava (La Costa)\" (I Have Love (La Costa)). In November 2017 she released a third single, called \"Nish'eret Itcha\" (Staying With You).\nIn April 2018, Dana recorded a new version of the Jewish folk song \"Hava Nagila\" to promote \"Israel Calling\", a pre-Eurovision event. 20 years after her win in the 1998 Eurovision Song Contest in Birmingham with her song Diva, Dana released a new version of her hit in June 2018, in association with NYX Hotel and pagfilms.\nIn July 2018, Dana performed at the rally during the 2018 Israeli LGBT's strike events with her song \"Ani Nitzakhti\" (I Won). Later that month she released a new version of the Jewish song \"Mi Ha'Ish\" (Who is the Man) to promote the Jerusalem Pride and Tolerance Parade, in which she performed in August.\n\nDana's Eurovision records[edit]\n\n\nYear\nArtist\nLanguage\nTitle\nWriters\nFinal\nPoints\nSemi\nPoints\nKdam\n\n\n1995\nDana International\nHebrew\n\"Layla Tov, Eropa\"\nDana International\nFailed to qualify for Eurovision\nNo Semi-finals\n2\n\n\n1998\nDana International\nHebrew\n\"Diva\"\nYoav Ginai\n1\n172\n\u2013\n\n\n2008\nBo'az Ma'uda\nHebrew, English\n\"The Fire in Your Eyes\"\nDana International, Shay Kerem\n9\n124\n5\n104\n1\n\n\n2011\nDana International\nHebrew, English\n\"Ding Dong\"\nDana International\nFailed to qualify\n15\n38\n1\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAlbums[edit]\n1993 Danna International (Offer Nissim Presents), IMP Dance\n1994 Umpatampa, IMP Dance\n1995 E.P.Tampa (Offer Nissim Featuring), IMP Dance\n1996 Maganuna (Crazy), Helicon/Big Foot\n1998 Diva - The Hits, IMP Dance\n1998 Dana International The Album, Helicon/Big Foot/PolyGram\n1999 Free, (European edition), CNR Music\n2000 Free, (Israeli & Japanese edition), NMC/NXCA\n2001 Yoter Ve Yoter (More and More), NMC\n2002 HaHalom HaEfshari (The Possible Dream), IMP Dance\n2003 The CDs collection, IMP Dance\n2007 Hakol Ze Letova (It's All for The Best), Hed Arzi Ltd.\nSingles[edit]\n1998 \"Diva\"\n2002 \"Makat hom (i la dirla da da)\"\n2008 \"I Need Your Love (feat. neAngely)\"\n2010 \"Alay (feat.

CanadaNationalityCanadianOccupationProfessor, cyclist, activist\nVeronica Ivy (born 1982), formerly Rachel McKinnon, is a Canadian philosophy professor, competitive cyclist, and transgender rights activist.[1][2] In 2018, she became the first transgender world track cycling champion by placing first at the UCI Women\u2019s Masters Track World Championship for the women's 35\u201344 age bracket.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Academic career\n3 Athletic career\n\n3.1 2019 cycling time trial\n\n\n4 Comment on celebrating death\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nIvy is from Victoria, British Columbia.[3] She earned a bachelors of arts degree in philosophy from the University of Victoria (2005). She completed her PhD from University of Waterloo in Philosophy in 2012,[4][5] with a thesis entitled \"Reasonable Assertions: On Norms of Assertion and Why You Don't Need to Know What You're Talking About\".[6]\nIvy has said she first began thinking she might be transgender when she was thirteen, but took sixteen more years to \"come to terms with it\". She started transitioning near the time she was finishing her doctorate, and came out \"two days after I defended my dissertation.\"[7] She wrote to her students to tell them that she was transgender on 2 May 2012.[8]\n\nAcademic career[edit]\nIvy is an associate professor of philosophy at the College of Charleston in South Carolina.[1][5] She earned tenure in March 2019, and became an associate professor in August the same year.[9]\nIvy's primary research focus is the philosophy of language. The majority of her published work is about the norms of the speech act of assertion,[4] pre-eminently her 2015 monograph The Norms of Assertion: Truth, Lies, and Warrant (Palgrave Macmillan, ISBN\u00a0978-1-137-52172-9).\nAnother focus of her work is feminism and feminist philosophy, particularly issues relating to gender and queer identities.[4] She has published articles on transgender and intersex issues in outlets including NBC News,[10] Vice,[11] and Newsweek.[12]\n\nAthletic career[edit]\nPrior to moving to the College of Charleston, Ivy played badminton. Lacking a strong badminton scene at Charleston, Ivy developed an interest in sport cycling.[7] On 12 October 2018, she won the world 200-meter sprint record for women in the 35\u201339 age range,[13] and the next day won the UCI Masters World Track Cycling Championship in the Women's Sprint 35\u201344 age bracket, becoming the first transgender world champion in track cycling.[14][15][16]\nSome in the sports world felt her birth sex gave her an unfair advantage.[17] American cyclist Jennifer Wagner, who finished third (bronze), said Ivy\u2019s birth sex gave her physiological advantages.[18] The second-place (silver-medal) winner, Dutch athlete Caroline van Herrikhuyzen, supported Ivy.[19] Ivy argued that there was no evidence that being born male gave an advantage in the race and that she had lost to Wagner in the past.[20] British columnist Katie Hopkins wrote \"The world is gripped by a febrile madness\".[21] Tennis player Martina Navratilova said that allowing people born male to compete in women's sports was \"insane\" and \"cheating\".[22] Ivy criticized Navr\u00e1tilov\u00e1's comments as \"transphobic.\"[23]\nIvy cited one of the fundamental rules of the International Olympic Committee that the practice of sport is a human right.[1] Her participation in the competition was consistent with rules in force since 2003.[24] Some commentators[who?] felt that Ivy had an advantage because of her size and muscle mass. Ivy objected to this criticism: she must keep her testosterone level low as a prerequisite for her participation in sports competitions.[24]\n\n2019 cycling time trial[edit]\nIn an October 2019 time trial, Ivy broke the record for the 200-meter sprint for females aged 34\u201339.[25]\nIn response, she received a number of death threats, and was targeted on Twitter by Donald Trump Jr.[26] In December 2019, she wrote an op-ed in The New York Times about this experience.[25][27][28]\n\nComment on celebrating death[edit]\nIn August 2019, in relation to the death of American billionaire David Koch, Ivy tweeted that \"it\u2019s okay to be happy, even celebrate, when bad people die\".[29][dead link][30] A respondent, believed to be alluding to the terminal illness of Magdalen Berns asked if Ivy \"thought it was OK to celebrate the death of a young person suffering from an incurable brain tumor\" (quoting the account of the Charleston The Post and Courier). Ivy replied: \"if they\u2019re a trash human actively trying to harm marginalized people because of who they are? I think it\u2019s justified\". The exchange provoked a petition by over 500 signatories seeking Ivy's public apology.[9][30]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Transgender women in sport: Are they really a 'threat' to female sport?\".

His comedic style takes the form of rambling whimsical monologues and self-referential pantomime.\nHe had a starring role in the television series The Riches as Wayne Malloy and has appeared in Ocean's Twelve, Ocean's Thirteen, Mystery Men, Shadow of the Vampire, The Cat's Meow, Across the Universe, Valkyrie, and Victoria & Abdul. He also worked as a voice actor in The Wild, Igor, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, Cars 2, The Lego Batman Movie, Abominable, and the Netflix Original Series Green Eggs and Ham.\nIzzard has won numerous awards including a Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program for his comedy special Dress to Kill, in 2000. Izzard's website won the Yahoo People's Choice Award[1] and earned the Webby Award.[2]\nIzzard has campaigned for various causes and has been a Labour Party activist for most of his adult life. Twice, he ran for a seat on Labour's National Executive Committee. When Christine Shawcroft resigned in March 2018, he took her place by default, but was not re-elected in that summer's NEC elections. In 2009, he completed 43 marathons in 51 days for Sport Relief despite having no history of long-distance running.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Comedy\n2.2 Theatrical, television and film appearances\n\n\n3 Comic style\n4 Political views and activism\n5 Personal life\n6 Honours\n7 Books\n8 Discography\n9 Filmography\n\n9.1 Film\n9.2 Television\n9.3 Theatre\n9.4 Video games\n\n\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 Further reading\n13 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nEdward John Izzard[4] was born on 7 February 1962 in the Colony of Aden,[5] the younger son of English parents Dorothy Ella Izzard (1927\u20131968) and Harold John Michael Izzard (1928\u20132018). His family name is of French Huguenot origin.[6] His mother was a midwife and nurse; his father was an accountant who was working in Aden with British Petroleum at the time of Izzard's birth.[7][8] When Izzard was one year old, the family moved to Northern Ireland, settling in Bangor, County Down, where they lived until Izzard was five.[4][5][7][9] The family then moved to Wales, where they lived in Skewen. Izzard's mother died of cancer when Izzard was six and his brother, Mark, was eight.[4][8][10] He and his brother built a model railway to occupy their time while their mother was ill (it was donated to Bexhill Museum in 2016).[11] Following his mother's death, Izzard attended [4][8] St John's School in Porthcawl, Mid Glamorgan,[12] St Bede's Prep School[13] and Eastbourne College.[14] He has said that he knew he was a transgender person[15] at the age of four, after watching another boy being forced to wear a dress by his sisters, and that he knew at the age of seven that he wanted to be an actor.[16]\n\nCareer[edit]\nComedy[edit]\n Elliott Gould and Izzard in 2006\n Izzard in 2008\nIzzard began to toy with comedy at the University of Sheffield with student friend Rob Ballard.[17][18] After leaving his accountancy degree, he and Ballard took their act to the streets,[17][18] often in Covent Garden.[12][19][20] After splitting with Ballard, Izzard spent a great deal of the early 1980s working as a street performer in Europe and the United States. Izzard says that he developed his comedic voice by talking to his audience while doing solo escape acts.[21] He then moved his act to the stand-up comedy venues of Britain. His first gig was at the Banana Cabaret in Balham, London.[4][22]\nIn 1987, Izzard made his first stage appearance at the Comedy Store in London.[9] He refined his material throughout the 1980s, and in the early 1990s began earning recognition through his improvisation, in part at his own club, \"Raging Bull\" in Soho.[20]\nIzzard's big break came in 1991 when he performed his \"Raised by Wolves\" sketch on the televised \"Hysteria 3\" AIDS benefit.[23]\nIzzard speaks French and has performed stand-up shows in the language; from 2014 he began to perform in German, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic,[24] languages that he did not previously speak.[25]\n\nTheatrical, television and film appearances[edit]\n Izzard at the 2013 British Academy Awards\nIn 1994, Izzard made his West End drama debut as the lead in the world premiere of David Mamet's The Cryptogram with Lindsay Duncan, in the production at London's Comedy Theatre. The success of that role led to his second starring role, in David Beaird's black comedy 900 Oneonta. In 1995, he portrayed the title character in Christopher Marlowe's Edward II.[26]\nIn 1998, Izzard appeared briefly on stage with Monty Python in The American Film Institute's Tribute to Monty Python (also referred to as Monty Python Live at Aspen). As part of an inside joke, he walked on stage with the five surviving Pythons and he was summarily escorted off by Eric Idle and Michael Palin as he attempted to participate in a discussion about how the group got together.[27] In July 2014, Izzard appeared on stage with Monty Python during their live show Monty Python Live (Mostly) as the special guest in their \"Blackmail\" sketch.[28]\nIzzard has appeared in a number of episodes of BBC One's Have I Got News For You. He portrayed comedian Lenny Bruce in the 1999 production of Julian Barry's 1971 play Lenny. In 2001, he replaced Clive Owen in Peter Nichols' 1967 play A Day in the Death of Joe Egg at the Comedy Theatre. Izzard and Victoria Hamilton repeated their lead roles when the show was brought to Broadway in 2003 in the Roundabout Theatre Company production. The revival received four Tony Award nominations, including Best Revival of a Play, Best Leading Actor, and Best Leading Actress for its stars Izzard and Hamilton in their Broadway debuts, and Best Direction for Laurence Boswell. In June 2010, Izzard replaced James Spader in the role of Jack Lawson in David Mamet's play Race on Broadway.[29]\nIzzard has appeared in numerous films, starting with 1996's The Secret Agent. He has appeared as several real-life individuals, including Charlie Chaplin in The Cat's Meow, actor Gustav von Wangenheim in Shadow of the Vampire, and General Erich Fellgiebel in Valkyrie. Other roles have included Mr Kite in Across the Universe, Lussurioso in Revengers Tragedy and criminal expert Roman Nagel in Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen. Izzard's voice work has included the titular \"It\" in Five Children and It, Nigel in The Wild and the mouse warrior Reepicheep in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. He declined to reprise his role as Reepicheep, a role understudied by Simon Pegg in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. He has stated that he felt he learned to act while working on the film Circus.[30]\nIzzard appeared in the 2009 BBC science fiction miniseries The Day of the Triffids, based on the 1951 novel, alongside Jason Priestley, Vanessa Redgrave, Joely Richardson, Dougray Scott and Brian Cox.[31]\nHe presented the medals to the athletes who had won the 800m T54 race at the London 2012 Paralympic Games, including gold medalist David Weir.[32] He played Dr. Hatteras, a skeptical psychology professor, in the Showtime series United States of Tara[33] and appeared in six episodes of the 2013\u201315 American psychological horror television series Hannibal as Dr. Abel Gideon.[34]\nIn 2014, he played the part of Robert Watson-Watt, in the BBC drama film Castles in the Sky, who invented aircraft-detecting radar equipment in time for the Battle of Britain.\nIn June 2017, Izzard read excerpts from his autobiography Believe Me for BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week.[35] He appeared as a guest on The Daily Show in May 2019 and discussed his current activities as a comic, his political aspirations, and his ongoing efforts as an avid marathon runner.[36]\n\nComic style[edit]\nIzzard uses a stream-of-consciousness delivery that jumps among topics. As he put it in a 2004 interview with The Guardian, \"It's the oral tradition. Human beings have been doing it for thousands of years\".[37] His bent towards the surreal went so far as to produce a sitcom called Cows in 1997 for Channel 4, a live action comedy with actors dressed in cow suits.[38] Izzard has cited Monty Python as his biggest influence, and Python's John Cleese once referred to him as \"the lost Python\".[9]\n\nPolitical views and activism[edit]\nIzzard is a staunch pro-European Union campaigner, supporting the further integration of the UK into the EU. In May 2005, he appeared on the BBC's political debate show Question Time, describing himself as a \"British-European\", comparing this with other cultural identities such as \"African-American\". As part of his integration campaigning, he was one of the first people to spend a euro in London. This pan-European approach has influenced his work; he regularly performs in French[19][33] and occasionally in German.[20] On 16 June 2017, on the \"Overtime\" segment of HBO political talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, Izzard claimed to be working in four languages: Spanish, German, French and English.\nIn July 2003, Izzard received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of East Anglia, Norwich, for \"pro-Europe campaigning\", \"his contribution to promoting modern languages and tolerance of other cultures and lifestyles\", and for having \"transcended national barriers\" with his humour.[39] He has also campaigned unsuccessfully against the closure of the departments of Drama and Languages, Linguistics and Translation at the University of East Anglia, although the department of Drama was later reprieved.[40]\nIn 1998, Izzard was named on a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party.[41] He appeared in a party political broadcast for the Labour Party in the run-up to the 2005 general election. He donated nearly \u00a310,000 to the party in 2008,[42] appeared again on a party political broadcast for the 2009 European election, and again in a 2010 election video entitled Brilliant Britain. Izzard appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote for electing Members of Parliament to the House of Commons in the Alternative Vote referendum in 2011[43] and is a supporter of the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform. On 25 February 2016, Izzard announced his intention to stand for the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.[44] It was announced on 9 August 2016 that Izzard had failed to be elected to the NEC.[45]\nOn 20 July 2006, Izzard received an honorary doctorate in Letters from the Faculty of Arts at the University of Sheffield,[46] where he had spent a year on an Accounting and Financial Management course in the early 1980s. During his time at the university he established the now-defunct Alternative Productions Society in the Union of Students with the aim of promoting fringe-based arts. On 4 March 2010, he was elected Honorary President of the University of Sheffield Students' Union.[47]\nOn 7 July 2007, Izzard was a presenter from the London Leg of Live Earth. During an interview for the 2008 Stripped tour, he spoke about becoming more active in European politics as well as running for political office in Europe within the next decade. Izzard added a stop in New Orleans during his 2008 Stripped tour. All proceeds from the performance of 23 June 2008 were donated to Neighborhood Housing Services of New Orleans.[48]\nIn March 2014, Izzard began leading a campaign encouraging Scottish people not to vote for independence in the September referendum, saying that England would feel a \"deep sense of loss\" if Scotland were to leave the UK.[49]\nIn September 2011, he declared his ambition to stand for the party as an MP, MEP, or Mayor of London,[50] announcing his intention to stand for the London mayoral election in 2020.[51][52] When asked on comedy panel show The Last Leg why he thought he might be elected, he replied \"Boris Johnson\".[53] He is also a republican, believing that Britain should have a democratically elected head of state.[54] He has stated that he is a social democrat, not a socialist.[55] Izzard confirmed his support for Labour in the 2015 general election, attending a party rally with fellow comedian Ben Elton and actress Sally Lindsay in April 2015.[56]\nOn 27 July 2009, with only 5 weeks' training and no significant prior running experience, Izzard began seven weeks of back-to-back marathon runs (with Sundays off) across the UK to raise money for Sport Relief. He ran from London to Cardiff to Belfast to Edinburgh and back to London, carrying the flag of the country\u2014England, Scotland, or Wales\u2014in which he was running. In Northern Ireland, he carried a self-designed green flag bearing a white dove. The blog Eddie Iz Running documented his 43 marathons in 51 days, covering at least 27 miles per day (totalling more than 1,100 miles), ending on 15 September 2009.[57]  He received a special award at BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2009 for his achievements.[58] In March 2010, Izzard took part in the Sport Relief Mile event.[59]\nOn 16 February 2016 the BBC announced that Izzard would attempt to run 27 marathons in 27 days through South Africa for Sport Relief.[60] The significance of the number 27 came from the number of years Nelson Mandela was held in prison. In total, Izzard would aim to run more than 700 miles in temperatures of up to 40\u00a0\u00b0C. He had attempted such a project in South Africa in 2012, but withdrew due to health concerns.[61] Izzard completed his first marathon on 23 February 2016. He completed the marathon challenge on 20 March 2016 at the statue of Mandela in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Because he had spent a day in hospital, he had to run two consecutive marathons on this last day. He raised more than \u00a31.35M for Sport Relief.[62] A BBC documentary detailing his feat was broadcast on 28 March.[63]\nIn May 2017, Izzard declared his intention to become a Labour politician after endorsing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He said: \"I like Jeremy Corbyn. He believes in what he says.\"[64] In October, he announced a renewed bid for election to Labour's National Executive Committee.[65] In January 2018, it was announced that Izzard had failed in his second bid to be elected to the NEC.[66] On 31 March 2018, Christine Shawcroft resigned from the Labour Party's NEC. Izzard replaced her and served until the next NEC election, held in summer 2018.[67] Izzard came ninth in that election, and so was not re-elected to the NEC.[68]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIzzard resides in Victoria, London.[69]\nDuring his 2008 Stripped tour, Izzard said he realised he was an atheist. He said, \"I was warming the material up in New York, where one night, literally on stage, I realised I didn't believe in God at all. I just didn't think there was anyone upstairs.\"[70] He has since described himself as a spiritual atheist, saying, \"I don't believe in the guy upstairs, I believe in us.\"[71]\nIzzard keeps his romantic life private, citing the wishes of his companions not wanting to become content for his show.[70] He dated Sarah Townsend, who later directed the documentary Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story,[19] and whom he first met while she was running a Fringe venue at the Edinburgh Festival in 1989.[72]\nIzzard supports Crystal Palace F.C. and became an associate director at the club on 16 July 2012.[73]\nIzzard is genderfluid[74] and calls himself \"somewhat boy-ish and somewhat girl-ish\".[15] He uses transgender as an umbrella term.[75] When asked what pronouns he prefers, Izzard said \"either 'he' or 'she.'\"[76] In the past, Izzard identified as a transvestite, and he has also called himself \"a lesbian trapped in a man's body\"[77] and \"a complete boy plus half girl\".[78] Izzard started to publicly identify as transvestite in venues such as the Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992.[79][80] His stance is that the way he dresses is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish. He said \"I don't call it drag; I don't even call it cross-dressing. It's just wearing a dress. ... It's not about artifice. It's about me just expressing myself.\"[81] He remarks in his show Unrepeatable that \"women wear what they want and so do I\". He has expressed a personal conviction that being transgender is caused by genetics and that someday this will be scientifically proven, having gone so far as to have his own genome sequenced.[82]\n\nHonours[edit]\nOn 18 March 2007, Izzard was listed as number 3 of the 100 Greatest British National Comedians (behind Peter Kay at number 2 and Billy Connolly at number 1) as part of British television station Channel 4's ongoing 100 Greatest\u00a0... series. In the 2010 updated version of the list he was ranked 5th.[83]\nIn 2003, he received an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of East Anglia (UEA)[84] and later went on to perform as part of the University's 50th Anniversary celebrations.[85]\nIn 2012, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Sunderland.[86]\nOn 20 February 2013, Izzard received the 6th Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism,[87][88] which is presented at Harvard University each year by the Humanist Community at Harvard,[89] the American Humanist Association, and the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics.\nIn 2015, Izzard was chosen, by readers of The Guardian as their 2014 public language champion. The award was announced at the Guardian and British Academy 2014 Schools Language Awards as part of the annual Language Festival.[90]\nOn 20 November 2018 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by York St John University.[91]\n\nBooks[edit]\nBelieve Me: A Memoir of Love, Death and Jazz Chickens (2017), Michael Joseph, ISBN\u00a0978-0718181727.[92]\nDiscography[edit]\n\n\nDate\n\nTitle\n\n\n15 November 1993\nLive at the Ambassadors\n\n\n14 March 1994\nUnrepeatable\n\n\n21 October 1996\nDefinite Article\n\n\n17 November 1997\nGlorious\n\n\n9 November 1998\nDress to Kill\n\n\n18 November 2002\nCircle\n\n\n26 November 2003\nSexie\n\n\n23 November 2009\nStripped\n\n\n15 January 2011\nLive at Madison Square Garden[93]\n\n\n18 November 2013\nForce Majeure\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1995\nThe Oncoming Storm\nLuthor Keeton\n\n\n\n1996\nThe Secret Agent\nVladimir\n\n\n\n1998\nVelvet Goldmine\nJerry Devine\n\n\n\n1998\nThe Avengers\nBailey\n\n\n\n1999\nMystery Men\nTony P\n\n\n\n1999\nThe Criminal\nPeter Hume\n\n\n\n2000\nCircus\nTroy\n\n\n\n2000\nShadow of the Vampire\nGustav von Wangenheim\n\n\n\n2001\nThe Cat's Meow\nCharlie Chaplin\n\n\n\n2001\nAll the Queen's Men\nTony Parker\n\n\n\n2002\nRevengers Tragedy\nLussurioso\n\n\n\n2003\nAlien Invasion\nBrik\n\n\n\n2004\nBlueberry\nProsit\n\n\n\n2004\nFive Children and It\nIt (voice)\n\n\n\n2004\nRomance & Cigarettes\nGene Vincent\n\n\n\n2004\nOcean's Twelve\nRoman Nagel\n\n\n\n2005\nThe Aristocrats\nHimself\nDocumentary\n\n\n2006\nThe Wild\nNigel(voice)\n\n\n\n2006\nMy Super Ex-Girlfriend\nProfessor Bedlam\n\n\n\n2007\nOcean's Thirteen\nRoman Nagel\n\n\n\n2007\nAcross the Universe\nMr. Kite\n\n\n\n2008\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\nReepicheep(voice)\n\n\n\n2008\nIgor\nDr. Schadenfreude(voice)\n\n\n\n2008\nValkyrie\nErich Fellgiebel\n\n\n\n2009\nRage\nTiny Diamonds\n\n\n\n2009\nBelieve: The Eddie Izzard Story\nHimself\nDocumentary\n\n\n2010\nEvery Day\nGarrett\n\n\n\n2011\nThe Other Side\nDean Bellamy\n\n\n\n2011\nCars 2\nSir Miles Axlerod(voice)\n\n\n\n2011\nLost Christmas\nAnthony\nAlso executive producer\n\n\n2014\nBoychoir\nDrake\n\n\n\n2015\nAbsolutely Anything\nHeadmaster\n\n\n\n2015\nDay Out of Days\nDag\n\n\n\n2016\nWhisky Galore!\nCaptain Wagget\n\n\n\n2016\nRock Dog\nAngus Scattergood(voice)\n\n\n\n2017\nThe Lego Batman Movie\nVoldemort(voice)\n\n\n\n2017\nVictoria & Abdul\nBertie, Prince of Wales\n\n\n\n2019\nAbominable\nBurnish(voice)\n\n\n\n2020\nThe High Note\nDan Deakins\n\n\n\n2020\nGet Duked!\nThe Duke\n\n\n\n2020\nSix Minutes to Midnight\nThomas Miller\nalso writer and executive producer\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1991\nBarf Bites Back\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n1994\nOpen Fire\nRich\nTelevision film\n\n\n1995\nAristophanes: The Gods are Laughing\nSocrates\nTelevision film\n\n\n1996\nTales from the Crypt\nEvans\nEpisode: \"Confession\"\n\n\n1998\nRex the Runt\nMelting Blob Man / Easter Island Head Aliens (voices)\n2 episodes\n\n\n1999\nPython Night \u2013 30 Years of Monty Python\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2002\nMongrel Nation\nHimself\nTelevision documentary\n\n\n2002\nA Day in the Death of Joe Egg\nBri\nTelevision film\n\n\n2003\n40\nRalph Outen\n3 episodes\n\n\n2006\nThe Secret Policeman's Ball\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2007\nKitchen\nNick Malone\n2-part series\n\n\n2007\u20132008\nThe Riches\nWayne Malloy / Doug Rich\n20 episodes\n\n\n2008\nThe Secret Policeman's Ball\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2009\nThe Day of the Triffids\nTorrence\n2 episodes\n\n\n2010\nEddie Izzard: Marathon Man\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2010\nThe Simpsons\nNigel Bakerbutcher / Elizabeth II / Prince Charles (voices)\nEpisode: \"To Surveil with Love\"\n\n\n2011\nUnited States of Tara\nDr. Hattarras\n8 episodes\n\n\n2011\nThe Good Wife\nJames Thrush\nEpisode: \"The Death Zone\"\n\n\n2012\nThe Secret Policeman's Ball\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2012\nTreasure Island\nLong John Silver\nTelevision miniseries\n\n\n2012\nBullet in the Face\nJohann Tannh\u00e4user\n6 episodes\n\n\n2012\nMockingbird Lane\nGrandpa\nTelevision film\n\n\n2013\nMeet the Izzards\nHimself\nTwo episode documentary\n\n\n2013\u20132015\nHannibal\nDr. Abel Gideon\n6 episodes\n\n\n2014\nCastles in the Sky\nRobert Watson-Watt\nTelevision film\n\n\n2015\nPowers\n\"Big Bad\" Wolfe\n10 episodes\n\n\n2015\nThe Devil You Know\nThomas Putnam\nPilot\n\n\n2016\nThe Big Fat Quiz of Everything\nHimself\n1 episode\n\n\n2018\nTravel Man\nHimself\nEpisode: \"48 Hours in Ljubljana\"\n\n\n2019\nThe Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\nCadia (voice)\nNetflix series\n\n\n2019\nGreen Eggs and Ham\nHervnick Z.

After graduating in 1989, she obtained an M.A. in English language and literature from the University of Chicago.[6]\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter college, James worked in advertising, first for several years at the Chicago Tribune, then for a decade at DDB Chicago. It was while working there that she transitioned.[5] She became involved in consumer activism, with an interest in medical and academic fraud.[7][8] In 1996 she created Transsexual Road Map, a consumer website for the transgender community,[9] and later set up HairFacts and HairTell, a website and discussion forum about hair removal.[10][11][12]\nJames moved to Los Angeles in 2003 and co-founded Deep Stealth Productions with her roommate, author and entertainer Calpernia Addams, to create content marketed to transgender people.[7][13][14] They filmed an instructional video, Finding Your Female Voice, to offer voice coaching to trans women,[15] and in 2004 produced and performed in the first all-transgender cast of The Vagina Monologues, debuting a new piece created by Eve Ensler for the occasion.[16][17] James was also a co-producer of and appeared in Beautiful Daughters, a documentary film about the event.[18]\nIn 2004 James founded the nonprofit GenderMedia Foundation.[19] The following year she was a script consultant for Transamerica (2005), helping actress Felicity Huffman prepare for her role as a trans woman.[20][21][22] She appeared in the HBO documentary Middle Sexes: Redefining He and She (2005), and in 2007 directed a 7-minute film, Casting Pearls.[23] She was a consulting producer for, and appeared in, the reality-dating television series Transamerican Love Story on the Logo digital channel in 2008.[24][25] In 2009 she directed another short film, Transproofed.[26]\nJames was appointed in 2007 to the Board of Directors of TransYouth Family Allies, a nonprofit that supports transgender youth and their families,[27][28] and in 2008 to the Board of Directors of Outfest, where she was involved in the restoration of the documentary Queens at Heart.[29][30] In 2012 she co-founded Thought Moment Media.[31] She directed the 2015 Showtime concert film Alec Mapa: Baby Daddy.[32]\n\nWriting and activism[edit]\n James and Calpernia Addams at the Out and Equal Workplace Summit, 2006\nJames writes about consumer rights, technology, pop culture, and LGBT rights. She has contributed to Boing Boing, QuackWatch, eMedicine, The Advocate, The Huffington Post and Wikipedia.[7][12][33][4]\nTogether with Lynn Conway and Deirdre McCloskey, James was a driving figure in protests\u2014described in 2007 as \"one of the most organized and unified examples of transgender activism seen to date\"[2]\u2014against J. Michael Bailey's book The Man Who Would Be Queen (2003). In the book, Bailey argues that there are two forms of transsexualism: one a variant of male homosexuality, and the other a male sexual interest in having a female body, a taxonomy critics see as inaccurate and damaging.[34] James argued that the book is a cure narrative, framed by one case report about a six-year-old child, that exemplifies the academic exploitation of transgender people.[35][36][37]\nThe dispute became heated when James posted a page on her website containing photographs of Bailey's children, alongside sexually explicit captions that quoted or parodied material in Bailey's book. Bailey accused her of harassment, as did Alice Dreger, a colleague of Bailey's at Northwestern University; Dreger tried to stop James from speaking at the campus about the controversy.[38][39][40][41] James responded that the page was intended to echo what she saw as Bailey's disrespect toward gender-variant children.[34]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Wikipedia people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Lam, Steven (June 20, 2006). \"What's 'gay' now: we are everywhere indeed\".

Some of her best known works as a fantasy artist are the cover illustration for TSR's Dragon Mountain adventure.[3][4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n\n2.1 The Dungeoneer and fantasy roleplaying\n2.2 Judges Guild, later independent role-playing projects, and TSR\n2.3 Freelance artwork\n2.4 Video game industry\n\n\n3 Awards and honors\n4 Activism\n5 Personal life\n6 Works\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nJennell Jaquays was born on October 14, 1956 in Michigan, named \"Paul Jaquays\", and grew up in Michigan and Indiana.[5] Jaquays graduated from Michigan's Jackson County Western High School in 1974 and Spring Arbor College in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art.[6]\n\nCareer[edit]\nThe Dungeoneer and fantasy roleplaying[edit]\nWhile still at college, Jaquays became interested in science-fiction and fantasy gaming and the nascent role-playing game industry through the pages of The Space Gamer.[citation needed] Jaquays discovered Dungeons & Dragons in 1975 and formed the Fantastic Dungeoning Society with several friends at college including Mark Hendricks.[7]:66 Together they decided to create a fanzine, which would provide adventures for other Game Masters.[7]:66 TSR's Tim Kask gave Jaquays a casual license to publish this fanzine, The Dungeoneer, an amateur publication but one of the earliest RPG periodicals.[7]:9\nThe first issue was published in the same month as Dragon #1 (June 1976).[7]:9 The first issue was mainly drawn and written by Jaquays, with some contributions from other FDS members.[7]:66 In all, FDS produced six issues of The Dungeoneer from 1976-1978.[7]:66 Marketed as a \"dungeonmaster's publication,\" the magazine was noteworthy for its pioneering approach to pre-factored adventures, \"F'Chelrak's Tomb\" was published in June 1976, the same month as Wee Warriors' Palace of the Vampire Queen. The publication has been an inspiration for many similarly-themed magazines in the United States and elsewhere.[8][9][10][11][12][13]\nIn addition to these \"honest efforts at quality contents to interest readers,\" Jaquays began submitting artwork to TSR's in-house gaming magazine, The Dragon, in 1976. Jaquays' work appeared in the premiere issue of The Dragon, and later contributions included the cover of issue #21.[12][14]\n\nJudges Guild, later independent role-playing projects, and TSR[edit]\nBy late 1977, Jaquays was approaching graduation and needed to spend more time in the art studio, so FDS sold The Dungeoneer to Chuck Anshell of Anshell Miniatures.[7]:66\u201367 Anshell soon came to work at Judges Guild, and Jaquays ended up there too by October 1978, working with them for a year as an illustrator and adventure designer.[7]:67 By late 1978 Judges Guild was a prolific provider of material and officially licensed products for TSR's Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) line.[13] Anshell retained a level of editorial control over The Dungeoneer, one of Judges Guild's two gaming periodicals. Jaquays worked on two stand-alone D&D modules for Dungeons & Dragons, Dark Tower and Caverns of Thracia, which were completed before she left the company in October 1979. She provided a variety of content on a freelance basis thereafter, particularly to The Dungeoneer.[13][15] Jaquays and Rudy Kraft authored Adventures Beyond the Pass for Judges Guild, which they never published; instead Greg Stafford liked it enough that Chaosium published it as Griffin Mountain (1981).[7]:68 The MicroGame Chitin: I (1978) by Metagaming Concepts featured art by Jaquays.[7]:79 Jaquays, Denis Loubet, and Jeff Dee produced Cardboard Heroes in the early 1980s for Steve Jackson Games.[7]:103\nJaquays expanded her career to include video game design in the early 1980s, but continued to work as a freelancer for various table-top game publishers including TSR, Chaosium, West End Games, Flying Buffalo, and Iron Crown Enterprises. She produced illustrations for Game Designers' Workshop (GDW), most notably creating all the starship illustrations in Traveller Supplement 9: Fighting Ships. A number of these became the basis for starship models from Ad Astra Games and the deckplans found in Mongoose Traveller Supplement 3 - Fighting Ships.\nFrom 1986 to 1993, she did freelance work while running a design studio.[16][17] Jaquays prepared a series of character-creation supplements called Central Casting (1988-1991) for Flying Buffalo, which were published by Task Force Games.[7]:40 Jaquays also prepared three more City Books (1990-1994) out of house for Flying Buffalo.[7]:40 From 1993 to 1997, she returned to full-time employment in the table-top gaming industry as an illustrator for TSR, including a six-month period as Director of Graphics. She left TSR just before their takeover by Wizards of the Coast. During this time, she played an active role in the creation of the Dragon Dice game, both as cover artist and icon designer.[16]\n\nFreelance artwork[edit]\nIn addition to many gaming artwork contributions (including artwork spread over two decades for TSR's first-line periodicals, Dragon and Dungeon) she worked as an illustrator and cartoonist for the Jackson Citizen Patriot in 1980. During the late 1980s, Jaquays was a regular interior artist for Amazing Stories, and contributed one cover for that publication.[18][19]\n\nVideo game industry[edit]\nMichael A. Stackpole worked for Coleco from 1980-1981, and brought friend and fellow RPG designer Jaquays over to Coleco.[7]:36 After leaving Judges Guild, Jaquays worked for Coleco, first in a freelance capacity from 1980, then as a full-time employee from 1981 to 1985. She developed and designed arcade conversions of many well-known titles such as Pac-Man and Donkey Kong for their home arcade video game system. Jaquays eventually became director of game design.[3] Jaquays assembled one of the first art and design studios for video game development at Coleco to make ColecoVision games.[20] During a freelance design studio period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she continued to be involved in the video game industry, with concept and design work for Epyx, Interplay Entertainment, and Electronic Arts.[17]\nFrom March 1997 Jaquays was employed as level designer for id Software,[20] best known for their Quake series of video games. She then moved to the Dallas-based Ensemble Studios, which had \"become a haven for ex-id Software developers.\" She worked there from early 2002, with former tabletop and computer gaming contemporary Sandy Petersen, until the company's closure in January 2009.  Petersen had previously hired Jaquays to be a content designer at id Software.[21][22][23][24]  In 2003 Jaquays co-founded The Guildhall at SMU, a video game education program, located at the Plano campus of Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas.[20] She helped create much of the program's original curriculum.[4][25][26][27] Jaquays continues as an advisor to The Guildhall program.[20] As of October 2009, Jaquays was employed as a senior-level designer with the North American division of Iceland's CCP Games.[4]\nJennell currently divides her creative energy between projects for design studio Dragongirl Studios, her Fifth Wall brand of game adventures and miniatures, and serving as the creative director for Olde Sk\u00fc\u00fcl, Inc.,[1] a digital game developer and publisher based in Seattle, Washington which she founded with three other veteran female developers in 2012.[28]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nJaquays' Dark Tower was nominated for the 1979 H.G. Wells award for Best Roleplaying Adventure. In November 2004, as part of the 30th anniversary celebration for Dungeons & Dragons, Dungeon magazine produced a list of the \"thirty greatest D&D Adventures of All Time.\" Dark Tower was the only entry on the list not published by TSR.[29] Jaquays was co-author and illustrator for Chaosium's Griffin Mountain RuneQuest scenario. Set in Glorantha, this highly praised scenario was nominated for the 1981 H.G. Wells award. The reworked version, Griffin Island, was nominated for the same award in 1986.[17] Coleco's Wargames, for which Jaquays was co-designer of gameplay, won the 1984 Summer C.E.S. original software award.[17] As a level designer for TSR's Castle Greyhawk module, Jaquays shared the 1989 Origins Gamer's Choice Award for Best Role-Playing Adventure.[30]\nJaquays has been honored as one of the Top 50 Transgender Americans You Should Know by LGBTQ Nation,[31] and a Trans 100 2015 Honoree.[32]\nJennell Jaquays' contributions to the early video game industry are recognized on a collectable trading Card #2036. Jaquays is noted here as one of the women filmed for the documentary film \"No Princess in the Castle.\"[33] In 2017, she was honored as a Hall of Fame Inductee for the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design,[34] as well as an Origins 2017 Guest of Honor.[35]\n\nActivism[edit]\nAs creative director for The Transgender Human Rights Institute in Seattle, Jennell Jaquays was involved in the petition to create \"Leelah's Law,\" outlawing conversion therapy of LGBT youth.[36] In response to the petition, in April 2015 President Barack Obama called for the banning of conversion therapy for minors.[37]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nJaquays has two children from her first marriage.[2] Jaquays announced in December 2011 that she identifies as a lesbian and trans woman.[38] She resides in Seattle, Washington, with her wife Rebecca Heineman.[2][1]\n\nWorks[edit]\nPartial bibliography of works in print\n\nThe Dungeoneer (D&D fanzine) (editor 1976\u201377; contributor 1976\u201379)\nDark Tower (AD&D Scenario \u2013 Judges Guild:88) (1980; revised 2001, 2007)\nThe Caverns of Thracia (D&D Scenario \u2013 Judges Guild:102) (1979; revised 2004)\nLegendary Duck Tower and Other Tales (Runequest Scenario \u2013 Judges Guild:220) (1980) (with Rudy Kraft)\nThe Unknown Gods (D&D Sourcebook \u2013 Judges Guild:420) (1980) (co-author)\nGriffin Mountain (Runequest Campaign Setting) (1981; revised and expanded 1986 as Griffin Island) (with Rudy Kraft and Greg Stafford)\nCults of Terror (Runequest Sourcebook) (1981) (co-author)\nThe Enchanted Wood (DragonQuest Module) (1981)\nTalons of Night (D&D Module:M5) (1987)\nThe Shattered Statue (AD&D/DragonQuest Module:DQ1) (1987)\nEgg of the Phoenix (AD&D Module:I12) (1987) (with Frank Mentzer)\nTerror in Skytumble Tor (part of AD&D Module: I13) (1987)\nCastle Greyhawk (AD&D Module:WG7) (1988) (credited as one of the co-authors; wrote Level 4)\nThe Savage Frontier (AD&D Module:FR5) (1988)\nCentral Casting: Heroes of Legend (Generic Sourcebook) (1988)\nCampaign Sourcebook and Catacomb Guide (AD&D 2nd edition sourcebook:DMGR1) (1990)\nCitybook VI \u2013 Uptown (1992) (co-author)\nShadows on the Borderland (Runequest Adventure) (1993) (co-author)\nCountry Sites (1995) (cover artist)\n\nPartial list of video game credits\n\n\nTitle\nReleased\nSystem name\nRole\n\n\nDonkey Kong\n\nJuly 1982\nColecoVision\nProject leader, design, and graphics conversion\n\n\nOmega Race\n\n1983\nColecoVision\nProject leader, design, and graphics conversion\n\n\nWarGames\n\n1984\nColecoVision\nProject leader, gameplay co-designer\n\n\n4x4 Off-Road Racing\n\n1988\nAmstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga, DOS, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum\nGame design\n\n\nThe Bard's Tale IV[citation needed]\n\n1991\u201392\n(unpublished)\nRewrite and integration\n\n\nQuake 2[39]\n\nDecember 9, 1997\nAmiga (68k), AmigaOS 4 (PowerPC), Nintendo 64, Macintosh, BeOS, Linux, Windows, PlayStation, Zeebo\nDesigner and level designer\n\n\nQuake III Arena[40]\n\nDecember 2, 1999\nLinux, Microsoft Windows, IRIX, Mac OS, Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox Live Arcade\nDesigner and level designer\n\n\nQuake III: Team Arena[41]\n\nDecember 2000\n\nDesigner and level designer\n\n\nAge of Empires III\n\nOctober 18, 2005\nMicrosoft Windows, Mac OS X, Windows Mobile, N-Gage\nArtist\n\n\nAge of Empires III: The WarChiefs\n\nMarch 7, 2006\nWindows, Mac OS X\nArtist\n\n\nHalo Wars\n\nFebruary 26, 2009\nXbox 360\nArtist and level designer\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nBiography portal\nVideo games portal\nList of video game industry people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"This Year's Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming Who's Who\". 1 April 2015.\n\n^ a b c \"Jennell Jaquays: The Reinvented Girl\".

She is known for being the first black openly transgender woman elected to public office in the United States,[1] serving since January 2018 on the Minneapolis City Council.\nJenkins moved to Minnesota to attend the University of Minnesota in 1979 and was hired by the Hennepin County government, where she worked for a decade. Jenkins worked as a staff member on the Minneapolis City Council for 12 years before beginning work as curator of the Transgender Oral History Project at the University of Minnesota's Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection in Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 Bibliography\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn in 1961, Andrea Jenkins was raised in North Lawndale, Chicago.[2][3] She has said she grew up in \"a low-income, working-class community\" and \"lived in some pretty rough places.\" She was raised by a single mother, Shirley Green, who was \"very loving and very much concerned that we get a good education.\"[4]\nWhen she was young and still presenting as male, she participated in the Cub Scouts and played football at Robert Lindblom Math & Science Academy before moving to Minneapolis in 1979 to attend the University of Minnesota.[2][3][5]\nIn her 20s, Jenkins came out as gay, married a woman, became a parent, and divorced.[5] At 30, she began to outwardly present as female and returned to college to finish her bachelor's degree from Metropolitan State University, which she followed by earning two master's degrees\u2013an MFA in creative writing from Hamline University and an MS in community economic development from Southern New Hampshire University.[2][5][6] During which, Jenkins worked as a vocational counselor for the Hennepin County government.[5] In 2018, Jenkins completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow.\n\nCareer[edit]\nJenkins worked for a decade as a vocational counselor with Hennepin County.[2][5] In 2001, Robert Lilligren, who was running for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council, asked Jenkins to be a part of his campaign.[5] After his election, Jenkins joined Lilligren's staff where she worked as an aide for four years.[7]\nIn 2005, Elizabeth Glidden was elected to the City Council and hired Jenkins as an aide, in part for Jenkins's extensive network that she had built up during her time in Lilligren's office. While on Glidden's staff, Jenkins earned a fellowship dedicated to transgender issues and helped to establish the Transgender Issues Work Group in 2014.[5] That year, she organized a City Council summit on transgender equity intended to highlight the issues trans people in Minnesota face.[8]\nIn 2010, Jenkins won the Naked Stages grant from the Jerome Foundation and Pillsbury House Theater. She created \"Body Parts: Reflections on Reflections.\"[9]\nIn 2015, after 12 years as a policy aide with the Minneapolis City Council, Jenkins began work at the University of Minnesota's Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection in Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies where she curates the Transgender Oral History Project (TOHP).[5] Lisa Vecoli, curator of the Tretter Collection, noted that the materials within the collection tend to be gay white male-focused. In her role as curator of the TOHP, Jenkins will seek to expand the trans narratives archived in the collection by recording oral histories from up to 300 individuals, totaling as many as 400 hours of interviews.[3]\nJenkins announced in December 2016 that she would run to represent Minneapolis's 8th Ward on the City Council. Glidden, who held the seat, announced that she would not run for reelection.[10] Her campaign slogan was \"Leadership. Access. Equity.\"[11] With Hayden Mora, Jenkins founded Trans United Fund, a political action committee (PAC) to aid transgender candidates.[12] On November 7, 2017, Jenkins won the election with more than 70% of the vote.[13] The Minneapolis City Council has only had six other Black members. During the 2017 election, three Black council members won their races.[14]\nShe was elected Vice President of City Council shortly after her election. She also serves as chair of the new Race Equity Subcommittee and helped create a Racial Equity Community Advisory Committee consisting of city residents.[15]\nJenkins was one of several dozen women featured on the January 29, 2018, Time cover.[16] The related article is about the many women who ran for office in 2017 and 2018. Five of the women featured are lesbian and transgender candidates, all recipients of money from the LGBTQ Victory Fund.[17]\nDespite initially supporting abolishing the Minneapolis Police Department following the killing of George Floyd, Jenkins later decided, following a recent wave of shooting, to instead support having police still respond to calls and do their job to \u201cserve and protect\u201d the community, and instead settled for supporting effort for Minneapolis to focus on creating more schools, housing and other services that prevent people from pursuing crime or turning to violence.[18]\nJenkins is one of three Minneapolis City Council members who voted to dismantle the city's police department, and afterwards began using private security for protection.[19]\nIn June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, Queerty named her among the fifty heroes \u201cleading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people\u201d.[20][21]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nJenkins is a performance artist, poet, and writer who identifies as bisexual and queer.[22][23] She is a grandmother. Her own mother now lives in Ward 8. She has a partner of eight years. Jenkins was diagnosed with Multiple sclerosis in 2018.[24]\nShe has participated in the Trans Lives Matter movement and chaired the board of Intermedia Arts.[3] In 2015, Jenkins was grand marshal of the Twin Cities Pride Parade.[22] Jenkins has cited Barack Obama, Harold Washington, the Black Panther Party, Jeremiah Wright, and Jesse Jackson as having influenced her to be involved with politics.[25]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nJenkins, Andrea (2006).

Convinced by Olympic decathlete Jack Parker's coach, L.\u00a0D.\u00a0Weldon, to try the decathlon, Jenner culminated a six-year decathlon career by winning the men's decathlon event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal,[3][4] setting a third successive world record and gaining fame as \"an all-American hero\".[5] Given the unofficial title of \"world's greatest athlete\",[6] Jenner established a career in television, film, writing, auto racing, business, and as a Playgirl cover model.[7]\nJenner has six children with three successive wives\u2014Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner\u2014and has since 2007 appeared on the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians with Kris, their daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kris's other children Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian.\nAssigned male at birth, Caitlyn Jenner publicly came out as a trans woman in April 2015. Her new name was publicly announced in July of that year, with her name and gender being legally changed the following September.[8] From 2015 to 2016, Jenner starred in the reality television series I Am Cait, which focused on her gender transition. In January 2017, she underwent sex reassignment surgery.[9] Jenner has been called the most famous transgender woman in the world.[10][11]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Decathlon career\n\n2.1 Early career\n2.2 Olympic success\n2.3 Impact\n2.4 International competitions\n2.5 National events\n2.6 Personal records\n\n\n3 Post-Olympic career\n\n3.1 Capitalizing on Olympic fame\n\n3.1.1 Wheaties spokesperson\n\n\n3.2 Television and film career\n3.3 Motorsports career\n3.4 Business\n\n\n4 Personal life\n\n4.1 Marriages\n4.2 Fatal car collision\n\n\n5 Gender transition\n\n5.1 Coming out as a transgender woman\n5.2 Media attention\n5.3 Reception\n\n5.3.1 General\n5.3.2 LGBT community\n5.3.3 Show and memoir\n\n\n\n\n6 Politics\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nCaitlyn Marie Jenner was born William Bruce Jenner on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York.[12] She was known as Bruce Jenner until June 2015. Her parents are Esther Ruth (n\u00e9e McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner, who was an arborist.[13][14] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Welsh descent.[15] Her younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut, on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner's success at the Olympic Games.[16][17] As a young child, Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia.[18]\nJenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for her freshman and sophomore years[19][20] and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for her junior and senior years, graduating in 1968.[21] Jenner earned a football scholarship and attended Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury.[22] Recognizing Jenner's potential, Graceland track coach L. D. Weldon encouraged Jenner to switch to the decathlon.[23] Jenner debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place.[24] Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.[25]\n\nDecathlon career[edit]\nAll mentioned Olympic events were men's events which took place prior to Jenner's gender transition.\nEarly career[edit]\nAt the 1972 U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was in fifth place in the men's decathlon, behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes, with only the last event remaining. Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the men's 1500 metres, Jenner qualified for the Olympic team by running a fast final lap, finishing 22 seconds ahead of the other runners. This prompted the Eugene Register-Guard to ask: \"Who's Jenner?\"[26][27] Following the Olympic Trials, Jenner finished in tenth place in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.[28] By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, Jenner was inspired to start an intense training regimen. \"For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, and this guy has it. I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games. I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 6\u20138 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year.\"[29]\nAfter graduating from Graceland, Jenner married girlfriend Chrystie Crownover and moved to San Jose, California. Crownover provided most of the family income by working as a flight attendant for United Airlines.[30] Jenner trained during the day and sold insurance at night, earning US$9,000 a year.[31][32] In the era before professional American athletes were allowed to compete in Olympic sports, this kind of training was unheard of. On the other hand, Soviet athletes were state sponsored, which gave them a certain advantage over amateur American athletes.[33][34] During this period, Jenner trained at the San Jose City College (SJCC) and San Jose State University (SJSU) tracks.[35][36] San Jose athletics centered on SJCC coach Bert Bonanno; at that time, the city was a hotbed for training and was called the \"Track Capital of the World\".[32] Many other aspiring Olympic athletes also trained at San Jose; the list included Millard Hampton, Andre Phillips, John Powell, Mac Wilkins, and Al Feuerbach.[35][37] Jenner's most successful events were the skill events of the second day: hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1500 meters.[5][38]\n\nOlympic success[edit]\n Jenner at the 1975 Pan American Games\nJenner was the American champion in the men's decathlon event in 1974, and was featured on the cover of Track & Field News magazine's August 1974 issue.[39][40] While on tour in 1975, Jenner won the French national championship,[41] and a gold medal at the 1975 Pan American Games, earning the tournament record with 8,045 points.[25] This was followed by new world records of 8,524 points at the U.S.A./U.S.S.R./Poland triangular meet in Eugene, Oregon on August 9\u201310, 1975, breaking Avilov's record,[42] and 8,538 points at the 1976 Olympic trials, also in Eugene.[27][43] The record in Eugene was a hybrid score because a timing system failure and wind aided marks. Still, Jenner was proud of \"A nice little workout, huh?\"\n\nWe got what we wanted. We scared the hell out of everybody in the world only a month away from the Games.[44]\nOf the 13 decathlons Jenner competed in between 1973 and 1976, the only loss was at the 1975 AAU National Championships, when a \"no height\" in the pole vault marred the score.[25]\nAt the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Jenner achieved five personal bests on the first day of the men's decathlon\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a \"home run\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0despite being in second place behind Guido Kratschmer of West Germany. Jenner was confident: \"The second day has all my good events. If everything works out all right, we should be ahead after it's all over.\" Following a rainstorm on the second day, Jenner watched teammate Fred Dixon get injured in the 110 meter hurdles,[45] so took a cautious approach to the hurdles and discus, then had personal bests in the pole vault, when Jenner took the lead, and javelin.[46] By that point, victory was virtually assured, but it remained to be seen by how much Jenner would improve the record. In the final event\u2014the 1500 meters, which was seen live on national television\u2014Jenner looked content to finish the long competition. Jenner sprinted the last lap, making up a 50-meter deficit and nearly catching the event favorite, Soviet Leonid Litvinenko, who was already well out of contention for the gold medal, but whose personal best had been eight seconds better than Jenner's personal best before the race. Jenner set a new personal best time and won the gold medal with a world-record score of 8,618 points.[5][27][29][47][48]\nOlympic world record performance:[49]\n\n\n\n100m (wind)\n\nLong jump (wind)\n\nShot put\n\nHigh jump\n\n400m\n\n110H (wind)\n\nDiscus\n\nPole vault\n\nJavelin\n\n1500m\n\n\n10.94 +0.0 PB819\n\n7.22 +0.0 PB865\n\n15.35 PB809\n\n2.03 PB882\n\n47.51 PB923\n\n14.84866\n\n50.04873\n\n4.80 PB1005\n\n68.52 PB862\n\n4:12.61 PB714\n\nImpact[edit]\nAfter the event, Jenner took an American flag from a spectator and carried it during the victory lap, starting a tradition that is now common among winning athletes.[50][51] Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: \"In 1972, I made the decision that I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this.\"[29] Jenner explained, \"It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got the rest of my life to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?\"[5]\nAs a result of winning the Olympic decathlon, Jenner became a national hero and received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States and was also named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1976.[4][22]\nJenner's 1976 world and Olympic record was broken by four points by Daley Thompson at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow; Thompson's victory was perhaps tainted by the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, though the top American at the time, Bobby Coffman, was not expected to push Thompson or challenge Jenner's record. In 1985, Jenner's Olympic decathlon score was reevaluated against the IAAF's updated decathlon scoring table and was reported as 8,634 for comparative purposes. This converted mark stood as the American record until 1991, when it was surpassed by eventual gold medalist, and world record holder, Dan O'Brien of Dan & Dave fame.[52] As of 2018[update], Jenner was ranked twenty-sixth on the world all-time list and ninth on the American all-time list.[53]\nJenner was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1980, the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986, the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame and the Connecticut Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, and the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.[54] For almost 20 years, San Jose City College hosted an annual Bruce Jenner Invitational competition.[55][56][57]\n\nInternational competitions[edit]\n\nRepresenting the \u00a0United States\n\n\nYear\n\nCompetition\n\nVenue\n\nPosition\n\nEvent\n\nNotes\n\n\n1972\n\nOlympic Games\n\nMunich, Germany\n\n10th\n\nDecathlon\n\n7722 pts\n\n\n1975\n\nPan American Games\n\nMexico City, Mexico\n\n1st\n\nDecathlon\n\n8045 pts A\n\n\n1976\n\nOlympic Games\n\nMontreal, Canada\n\n1st\n\nDecathlon\n\n8618 pts\n\nNational events[edit]\n1972 United States Olympic Trials:  (7846 pts)[58]\n1973 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships: 5th (7617 pts)[58]\n1974 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships:  (8245 pts)[59]\n1975 French Athletics Championships:  (8058 pts)[60]\n1976 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships:  (8542 pts)[59]\n1976 United States Olympic Trials:  (8538 pts)[58]\nPersonal records[edit]\nAll information from IAAF[61]\n\n100 meters \u2013 10.94 (1976)\n400 meters \u2013 47.51 (1976)\n1500 meters \u2013 4:12.61 (1976)\n110 meters hurdles \u2013 14.84 (1976)\nHigh jump \u2013 2.03 m (1976)\nPole vault \u2013 4.80 m (1976)\nLong jump \u2013 7.22 m (1976)\nShot put \u2013 15.35 m (1976)\nDiscus throw \u2013 50.04 m (1976)\nDecathlon \u2013 8634 pts (1976)\nPost-Olympic career[edit]\nCapitalizing on Olympic fame[edit]\n Jenner (right) greets Liberian president William Tolbert at the White House on September 21, 1976, as United States President Gerald Ford looks on\nIn the 1970s, Olympic athletes were considered to be amateurs and were not allowed to seek or accept payment for their positions as sports celebrities. During the Cold War in 1972, three major Olympic titles that had a long history of American success\u00a0\u2013\u00a0basketball, the 100 meter dash, and decathlon\u00a0\u2013\u00a0were won by Soviet athletes. All Soviet athletes were professionals, while the United States was limited to amateurs.[62][33][34] Jenner became an American hero by returning the decathlon title to the United States. \"After the Games were over,\" Jenner said, \"I happened to be the right guy, at that right place, at that right time.\"[29] Tony Kornheiser of The New York Times wrote: \"Jenner is twirling the nation like a baton. He and wife, Chrystie, are so high up on the pedestal of American heroism, it would take a crane to get them down.\"[5][30][63]\nAfter the expected Olympic success, Jenner planned to cash in on whatever celebrity status could follow a gold medal in the same mold as Johnny Weissmuller and Sonja Henie, who had become major movie stars following their gold medals. This would require forgoing any future Olympic competition. At the time, Jenner's agent George Wallach felt there was a four-year window\u00a0\u2013\u00a0until the next Olympics\u00a0\u2013\u00a0upon which to capitalize. Wallach reported that Jenner was being considered for the role of Superman, which ultimately went to Christopher Reeve. \"I really don't know how many offers we have,\" Wallach claimed. \"There are still unopened telegrams back at the hotel and you just can't believe the offers that poured in during the first two days.\"[64]\nJenner appeared on the cover of the August 9, 1976, issue of Sports Illustrated,[65] the February 1979 issue of Gentleman's Quarterly,[66] and on the cover of Playgirl magazine.[7] Jenner became a spokesperson for Tropicana, Minolta, and Buster Brown shoes.[29] Jenner was also selected by the Kansas City Kings with the 139th overall pick in the seventh round of the 1977 NBA draft despite not having played basketball since high school.[67] The publicity stunt was executed by team president/general manager Joe Axelson to mock the Kansas City Chiefs' yearly claims that they planned on selecting \"the best athlete available\" in the National Football League Draft. Jenner was presented with a jersey customized with the number 8618, the Olympic-gold-medal-winning score, but would never appear as an active player with the Kings.[68]\n\n\nWheaties spokesperson[edit]\n\n\n Image of a throwback Wheaties cereal box featuring Jenner. The box reflects designs from the 1970s, when General Mills used Jenner for branding their breakfast cereal. A vintage box sold in 2015 on eBay for US$400 after she announced her gender transition.[69][70]\nIn 1977, Jenner became a spokesperson for Wheaties brand breakfast cereal and appeared in a photograph on the cover of the cereal box. After taking over from Olympic champion Bob Richards, Jenner was second in a succession of athletes featured as spokespersons for the brand. Mary Lou Retton succeeded Jenner in 1984.[71]\nOn November 22, 1977, Jenner went to San Francisco to refute charges filed by San Francisco district attorney Joseph Freitas that General Mills\u2014the maker of Wheaties\u2014had engaged in deceptive advertising in its campaign that featured Jenner. Jenner liked Wheaties and ate the breakfast cereal two or three times a week, which supported the advertising campaign's claims. Two days later, Freitas withdrew the suit, saying that it was \"a case of overzealousness\" on the part of his staff.[72]\nWhen Jenner came out as a trans woman in 2015, General Mills stated that: \"Bruce Jenner continues to be a respected member of Team Wheaties.\" After a negative response to this initial statement, Mike Siemienas, General Mills's brand media relations manager, clarified it by saying: \"Bruce Jenner has been a respected member of Team Wheaties, and Caitlyn Jenner will continue to be.\"[73]\n\nTelevision and film career[edit]\nJenner began television appearances in the mid-1970s, both as herself and in character roles. One of Jenner's first recurring television roles was as a co-host of the short-lived daytime talk and variety series America Alive! in 1978. The comedy Can't Stop the Music (1980) was Jenner's first film appearance. She starred in the made-for-TV movies The Golden Moment: An Olympic Love Story[74] (1980) and Grambling's White Tiger (1981).[75] During the 1981\u20131982 season, Jenner became a semi-regular cast member in the police series CHiPs, guest-starring as Officer Steve McLeish for six episodes, substituting for star Erik Estrada, who was locked in a contract dispute with NBC and MGM.[3] Jenner also appeared in an episode of the sitcom Silver Spoons called \"Trouble with Words\", wherein her personal issues with dyslexia were revealed in a storyline about a recurring teenage character with the same problem.\nJenner appeared in the series Learn to Read[76] and in the video games Olympic Decathlon[77] (1981) and Bruce Jenner's World Class Decathlon (1996).[78] The \"hero shot\", the finish of the final event of the 1976 Olympic decathlon, and the Wheaties cover, were parodied by John Belushi on Saturday Night Live, endorsing \"Little Chocolate Donuts\".[79] In 1989, Jenner played herself in the comedy short Dirty Tennis written by James Van Patten.[80]\n\n Jenner in 1996\nJenner has appeared in a variety of game shows and reality television programs, including starring with Grits Gresham in an episode of The American Sportsman.[81] In the early 1990s, Jenner was the host of an infomercial for a stair-climbing exercise machine called the Stair Climber Plus.[82]\nIn January 2002, Jenner participated in an episode of the American series The Weakest Link, featuring Olympic athletes.[83] In February and March 2003, Jenner was part of the cast of the American series I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.[84] She made a cameo appearance in a season-three episode of The Apprentice, which aired in May 2005.[85] She also partnered with Tai Babilonia for Skating with Celebrities[86] in a series that aired January\u00a0\u2013\u00a0March 2006 (they were eliminated during the fifth of seven episodes), served as a guest judge on Pet Star on Animal Planet.[87] In November 2010, a photograph of Jenner was shown in a janitor's resume in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.[88]\nAdditional television and talk show appearances by Jenner include: Nickelodeon's made-for-TV film Gym Teacher: The Movie[89] as well as episodes of Murder, She Wrote,[90] the Lingo Olympic Winners episode,[91] and talk shows such as Hannity[92] and season\u00a01, episode\u00a021 of The Bonnie Hunt Show in 2008.[93]\nSince late 2007, Jenner has starred in the E! reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians along with wife Kris Jenner, stepchildren Kourtney, Kimberley, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian (from Kris's marriage to attorney Robert Kardashian), and daughters Kylie and Kendall.[94]\nIn 2011, Jenner appeared in the Adam Sandler comedy Jack and Jill in a scene with Al Pacino as an actor in a play.[95] Like Can't Stop the Music, the film won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture and swept every Razzie category.[96]\nIn September 2016, Jenner appeared as herself on the Amazon Prime TV series Transparent in a dream sequence during the season three episode \"To Sardines and Back\".[97]\nIn November 2019, it was announced that Jenner would be participating in the nineteenth season of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.[98]\n\nMotorsports career[edit]\nJenner had a short career as a race car driver in the IMSA Camel GT series (International Motor Sports Association) in the 1980s.[99] Jenner's first victory came in the 1986 12 hours of Sebring in the IMSA GTO class driving the 7-Eleven Roush Racing Ford Mustang with co-driver Scott Pruett. The pair won their class and finished 4th overall in the 12-hour endurance race. 1986 was also the most successful year of Jenner's career, finishing second in the championship to Pruett.[100][101] Jenner commented, \"I was a lot more badass runner than I was a driver.\"[102]\nJenner also competed in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race at the Grand Prix of Long Beach, winning in 1979 and 1982. The former win came after holding off Al Unser, while the latter saw Jenner pass Ted Nugent with two laps remaining.[103][104] In 1980, Jenner was contacted by NASCAR Winston Cup Series team DiGard Motorsports about driving the No. 88 car for the 1981 season; although Jenner expressed interest, Ricky Rudd was ultimately hired for the seat.[105][106]\n\nBusiness[edit]\n Jenner at the Web Summit 2017, in Lisbon, Portugal\nJenner had licensed her previous name for Bruce Jenner's Westwood Centers for Nautilus & Aerobics in the early 1980s to David A. Cirotto, president of other local Nautilus & Aerobics Centers. She had no ownership in the licensed name centers,[31] which were solely owned by Cirotto.[107] Jenner's company, Bruce Jenner Aviation, sells aircraft supplies to executives and corporations.[31] Jenner was the business development vice president for a staffing industry software application known as JennerNet, which was based on Lotus Domino technology.[108]\nIn March 2016, Jenner announced that she had been chosen as the face of H&M Sport.[109] Later that year, H&M created a six-minute film featuring Jenner, called Caitlyn Jenner's Greatest Victories: A Timeline.[110]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMarriages[edit]\nPrior to her public gender transition, Jenner had been married three times, first to Chrystie Scott (n\u00e9e Crownover) from 1972 to 1981. They have two children, son Burton \"Burt\" Jenner and daughter Cassandra \"Casey\" Marino (n\u00e9e Jenner).[111][112] Jenner and Scott's divorce was finalized the first week of January 1981.[113]\nOn January 5, 1981, Jenner married actress Linda Thompson in Hawaii.[114] They have two sons together, Brandon Jenner and Sam Brody Jenner (known as Brody).[115] By February 1986, Jenner and Thompson had separated and subsequently divorced.[116] Their sons later starred on the reality show The Princes of Malibu,[117] and Brody appeared in the reality show The Hills.[118]\nOn April 21, 1991, Jenner married Kris Kardashian (n\u00e9e Houghton) after five months of dating.[119] They have two daughters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner. While married, Jenner was also the step-parent to Kris's children from her previous marriage\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Robert\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who star in Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The couple separated in June 2013, but the separation was not publicly announced until four months later, in October.[120][121][122] Kris filed for divorce in September 2014, citing irreconcilable differences.[123] Their divorce terms were finalized in December 2014 and went into effect on March 23, 2015, as mandated by a state legal requirement for a six-months delay after the filing.[124]\n\nFatal car collision[edit]\nIn February 2015, Jenner was involved in a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. Kim Howe, an animal rights activist and actress, was killed when Jenner's SUV ran into Howe's car. Accounts of the sequence of collisions have varied, as have the number of people injured.[125] Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, but three civil lawsuits were filed against Jenner by Howe's stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved in the collision.[126][127] Jessica Steindorff, a Hollywood agent who was hit by Howe's car, settled her case in December 2015. Howe's stepchildren settled their case in January 2016.[128] Financial details were not disclosed in either case.[129]\n\nGender transition[edit]\nComing out as a transgender woman[edit]\n The Washington Post commented that Jenner's debut Vanity Fair cover, shot by Annie Leibovitz, had special significance for its subject: \"After all the magazine covers that featured the former athlete, once lauded as the 'world's greatest athlete,' the Leibovitz photograph will be the most meaningful. Looking directly at the camera, Jenner is finally herself for the first time publicly.\"[6][130]\nIn a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in April 2015, Jenner came out as a trans woman, saying that she had dealt with gender dysphoria since her youth and that, \"for all intents and purposes, I'm a woman.\" Jenner cross-dressed for many years and took hormone replacement therapy but stopped after her romance with Kris Kardashian became more serious, leading to marriage in 1991.[131][132][133] Jenner recounts having permission to explore her gender identity on her own travels but not when they were coupled, and that not knowing the best way to talk about the many issues contributed to the deterioration of the 23-year-long marriage, which ended formally in 2015.[133]\nIn 2015, Jenner said that she has never been sexually attracted to men, but always to women, and that, keeping in mind the difficulty people have understanding the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity, she would identify as asexual for the time being.[134][135] Jenner underwent cosmetic surgery, and ultimately completed sex reassignment surgery in January 2017.[9]\n\nMedia attention[edit]\nIn June 2015, Jenner debuted her new name and image, and began publicly using feminine pronoun self-descriptors.[136] Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner.[137][138] Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed with the family in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized that there is no one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent first before focusing on her transition.[139] In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.[140]\nJenner's announcement that she is transgender came at an unprecedented time for trans visibility, including legislative initiatives.[141][142] The 20/20 interview had 20.7 million viewers, making it television's \"highest-ever rated newsmagazine telecast among adults 18\u201349 and adults 25\u201354\".[143] The Daily Beast wrote that Jenner's honesty, vulnerability, and fame may have caused \"cheap jokes\" about trans people to \"seem mean to a mainstream audience on an unprecedented scale\".[144] Noting the shift in how comedians treated Jenner's transition, The Daily Beast saw the change as the same evolution that took place in acceptance of LGBT people as a whole when \"comedians finally cross the critical threshold from mockery to creativity in their joke-telling\".[144]\nJenner's emerging gender identity was revealed in a Vanity Fair interview written by Buzz Bissinger. Annie Leibovitz photographed the cover, the magazine's first to feature an openly transgender woman, which was captioned \"Call me Caitlyn\".[145][146] Using her Twitter handle, @Caitlyn_Jenner, she tweeted: \"I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.\" Time magazine declared this tweet the tenth most re-tweeted tweet of 2015, based on re-tweets of tweets by verified users from January 1 to November 10 of that year.[147] Jenner amassed over one million Twitter followers in four hours and three minutes, setting a new Guinness World Record and surpassing United States President Barack Obama, who, a month before, accomplished the same feat in four hours and fifty-two minutes.[148][149] Four days later Jenner was up to 2.37 million followers, with another 1.5 million followers on Instagram.[150]\nJenner was also mocked. Beginning in September 2015, she was depicted on the satirical American animated program South Park, which parodied her supporters' political correctness, as well as her driving record. The Jenner-related episodes were \"Stunning and Brave\", \"Where My Country Gone?\", \"Sponsored Content\", \"Truth and Advertising\" and \"PC Principal Final Justice\" from the show's 19th season.[151][152]\nIn April 2016 during the Republican presidential primaries, Jenner became an exemplar for candidate Donald Trump's opposition to North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, with Trump saying that Jenner could use any restroom of her choosing at his Trump Tower property. Jenner soon posted a video showing that she had taken Trump up on his offer. She thanked Trump and assured Trump's adversary Ted Cruz that \"nobody got molested\".[153][154]\nIn June 2016, Jenner was one of several celebrities depicted using synthetic nude \"sleeping\" bodies for the video of Kanye West's song \"Famous\".[155] Later that month, an episode of Epic Rap Battles of History was released featuring Jenner, as Bruce (portrayed by Peter Shukoff) and then Caitlyn (portrayed by transgender rapper Jolie \"NoShame\" Drake), rap battling against Bruce Banner (portrayed by Lloyd Ahlquist) then The Hulk (portrayed by Mike O'Hearn).\n\nReception[edit]\nGeneral[edit]\nIn August 2015, Jenner won the Social Media Queen award at the Teen Choice Awards.[156] In October 2015, Glamour magazine named her one of its 25 Glamour Women of the Year, calling her a \"Trans Champion.\"[157] In November 2015, Jenner was listed as one of Entertainment Weekly's 2015 Entertainers of the Year.[158] In December 2015, she was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of 2015.[159] Also in that month, she was listed on Time magazine's eight-person shortlist for the 2015 Person of the Year,[160] and Bing released its list of the year's \"Most Searched Celebrities\", which Jenner was at the top of, and declared Jenner's Vanity Fair cover the second in a list of \"top celeb moments of 2015.\"[161][162] She was the second most searched for person on Google in 2015.[163] In April 2016, she was listed in the Time 100.[164] In June 2016, Jenner became the first openly transgender person to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. The cover and associated story marked the 40th anniversary of her winning the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon.[165][166]\nFeminist author Germaine Greer called Glamour magazine's decision to award Jenner with a \"Woman of the Year\" award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman could be better than \"someone who is just born a woman.\"[167] Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for stating\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in a BuzzFeed interview[168]\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 that the hardest part about being a woman \"is figuring out what to wear\". McGowan argued: \"We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well fucking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.\" McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: \"Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism.\"[169][170]\nChris Mandle of The Independent stated: \"Jenner has gone on to inspire countless men and women, but her comments, which were made after she was celebrated at Glamour magazine's Women Of The Year in New York were branded 'offensive and insulting'.\" He added: \"People began tweeting the other, harder things women have to deal with, such as institutionalized oppression, abuse and sexual assault\".[171] James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, the only female New York Police Department officer to die on September 11, 2001, returned Moira's \"Woman of the Year\" award, given posthumously. Referring to Jenner as a man, he stated that he found Glamour giving Jenner the same award insulting to Moira's memory, and referred to the matter as a publicity stunt.[172][173] Smith later said that, having supported transgender youth and Glamour's decision to honor transgender actress Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner's \"hardest part about being a woman\" commentary; this proved to him that Jenner \"is not truly a woman. I believe this comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it.\"[174]\nConversely, Adrienne Tam of The Daily Telegraph argued that Jenner deserved the Glamour award, stating: \"What McGowan failed to take into consideration was the jesting manner in which Jenner spoke.\" Tam said:\n\n[Jenner] also immediately followed up her \"what women wear\" dilemma with: It's more than that. I'm kind of at this point in my life where I'm trying to figure this womanhood thing out. It is more than hair, makeup, clothes, all that kind of stuff. There's an element here that I'm still kind of searching for. And I think that'll take a while. Because I think as far as gender, we're all on a journey. We're all learning and growing about ourselves. And I feel the same way.\nTam considered McGowan's criticism to be over the top, and stated of James Smith's criticism, \"The salient point here is one about courage. We easily recognise physical courage such as saving orphans from burning buildings, or ordinary people putting their lives in the line of fire. It is far harder to recognise mental courage.\" She added: \"Without a doubt, the police officer who died in the September 11 attacks was courageous. But so is Jenner. It's a different kind of courage, but it is courage nonetheless.\"[175]\n\nLGBT community[edit]\nSince coming out as a trans woman in 2015, Jenner has been called the most famous openly transgender woman in the world.[8][10][11] She is also one of the most recognized LGBT people in the world and arguably the most famous LGBT athlete.[176] Jenner said that her visibility was partly to bring attention to gender dysphoria, violence against trans women, and other transgender issues.[177] She also sought to promote more informed discussion of LGBT issues.[177] She signed with Creative Artists Agency's speakers department and will collaborate with the CAA Foundation on a philanthropic strategy focusing on LGBT issues.[178] She made a private appearance at the Los Angeles LGBT Center in June 2015, where she spoke with trans youth.[179]\nJenner received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the 2015 ESPY Awards in July 2015. ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt said Jenner was given the award because \"she has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.\"[180] She is the third consecutive openly LGBT person to receive the award following footballer Michael Sam (2014) and anchorwoman Robin Roberts (2013).[181]\nIn October, Jenner presented the Point Foundation's Horizon Award to television producers Rhys Ernst (of the show Transparent) and Zach Zyskowski (of the show Becoming Us).[182][183] This was her second public speaking engagement after her gender transition.[183]\nIn November, Jenner was listed as one of the nine runners-up for The Advocate's Person of the Year.[184] That month she was also listed as one of the Out100 of 2015, with Out calling her the \"Newsmaker of the Year.\"[185] On International Human Rights Day, Jenner discussed transgender rights with Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.[186] In 2016, Jenner was on the cover of The Advocate's February/March issue.[187]\nMAC Cosmetics collaborated with Jenner on a lipstick, called Finally Free, which was made available for purchase April 8, 2016, with MAC stating, \"100% of the selling price goes to the MAC AIDS Fund Transgender Initiative, to further its work in support of transgender communities.\"[188][189] Also in April 2016, Jenner was listed as No.\u00a08 on Out magazine's Power 50 list.[190][191] In May 2016, her interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015 won Outstanding TV Journalism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Newsmagazine at the GLAAD Media Awards.[192]\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Jenner and others told the stories of the people killed there.[193][194]\nIn July 2016, Jenner spoke about coming out as transgender and Republican at a Republican National Convention \"Big Tent Brunch\" for the conservative group American Unity Fund.[195][196]\n\nShow and memoir[edit]\nMain article: I Am Cait\nJenner's gender transition is the subject of I Am Cait, initially an eight-part TV documentary series, which premiered on E! in July 2015 to an audience of 2.7 million viewers.[197][198][199] Jenner is an executive producer of the show.[200] The show focuses on Jenner's transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends. The show also explores how Jenner adjusts to what she sees as her job as a role model for the transgender community.[201][202] In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016.[203] The show tied for Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.[204][205]\nJenner's memoir, The Secrets of My Life, was published on April 25, 2017.[206]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nJenner is a Christian, leans towards political conservatism, and is a Republican.[207][208] \"I have gotten more flak for being a conservative Republican than I have for being trans,\" she has said.[209] Although stopping short of an endorsement, Jenner said she liked Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, despite Cruz's negative views of trans people.[210] On her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner said that although she does not support Donald Trump, she thinks he would be good for women's issues; she then stated she would never support Hillary Clinton.[211] She ended up voting for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[212]\nIn February 2017, President Trump rescinded federal requirements giving transgender students the right to choose the school restroom matching their gender identity. In response, Jenner tweeted \"Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.\"[213]\nIn April 2017, Jenner said she was in favor of same-sex marriage.[214]\nIn July 2017, Jenner announced that she was contemplating running in the 2018 race for the US Senate to represent California.[215] Later in the month, she condemned Trump for issuing an order to reinstate a ban on transgender people from serving in the military. In her tweet, she wrote \"What happened to your promise to fight for them?\", juxtaposing it with Trump's tweet from June 2016 in which he promised to fight for the LGBT community.[212]\nIn an October 2018 Washington Post opinion piece, Jenner wrote that she was mistaken in her belief that Trump and his administration would support the LGBTQ community and vowed to learn from her error. \"The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president.\"[216] Her reversal came after a Trump administration proposal to restrict the legal definition of a person's gender to that assigned at birth.[217]\n\nSee also[edit]\nHistory of transgender people in the United States\nList of athletes on Wheaties boxes\nList of transgender people\nAmerican football portalAthletics portalBiography portalBusiness and economics portalConservatism portalFilm portalSports portalOlympics portalTelevision portalUnited States portalTransgender portal\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Fox Business News: Keeping Up with the Kardashians and Their Net Worth \u2013 Just How Rich are the Kardashians?\".

Christine Connelly, a member of the board of directors for the Boston Alliance of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth, stated, \"She was the first young person who picked up the national spotlight, went on TV and was able to articulate her perspective and point of view with such innocence.\"[3] Her parents noted that Jennings was clear on being female as soon as she could speak.[4]\nJennings is an honorary co-founder of the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation, which she and her parents founded in 2007 to assist transgender youth. In 2013, she founded Purple Rainbow Tails, a company in which she fashions rubber mermaid tails to raise money for transgender children.[5]\nJennings hosts a series of YouTube videos about her life, titled \"I Am Jazz\".[3][6] Jennings stars in the TLC reality TV series, I Am Jazz, which focuses on her life with her family as a teenager and as a transgender youth. The series premiered on July 15, 2015.[3][7]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nJennings was born in South Florida to parents Greg and Jeanette (\"Jennings\" is a pseudonym).[8][9] The family is Jewish,[10] and their last name is \"a very Jewish, long last name.\"[11]\nJennings has an older sister, Ari, and two older brothers, twins Sander and Griffen.[12]\nJennings was assigned male at birth. She was diagnosed with gender dysphoria by age five, making her one of the youngest publicly documented people to be identified as transgender.[13] Jennings made it clear as soon as she could speak that she was female, and, although the family presented her publicly in gender-neutral clothing, she wanted to be presented in feminine clothing.[4]\nAs a child, Jennings went to Camp Aranu'tiq, the first sleepaway camp for transgender children.[14]\nJennings attended Broward Virtual School, where she was the valedictorian of the class of 2019. She was accepted to Harvard University, but delayed entry for a year.[15][16]\n\nCareer[edit]\n Jazz with trans activist and author Abby Stein at the 2016 Philadelphia Trans Health Conference. They were both named as one of the \"9 Jewish LGBTQ Activists You Should Know\" by JTA and TOI.\nAt six years old, Jennings and her family began appearing on television to speak about the challenges of growing up transgender.[17] Her story has been covered by national television shows 20/20[6][17] and The Rosie Show,[18] where she appeared alongside Chaz Bono.\nIn 2007, Jennings and her parents founded TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation to assist transgender youth.[19][20]\nIn 2011, I Am Jazz: A Family in Transition, a documentary about her life and family, premiered on the Oprah Winfrey Network.[21]\nIn 2013, Jennings founded Purple Rainbow Tails, a company in which she fashions rubber mermaid tails to raise money for transgender children.[19][20] That same year, in a follow-up interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20, they discussed Jennings' two-and-a-half-year battle with the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), the governing US body for the sport, to allow her to play on girls' teams. Aided by the National Center for Lesbian Rights, she succeeded in changing the USSF's policies to allow trans students to play.[22]\nThat September, Jennings co-wrote a children's book, I Am Jazz, with Jessica Herthel, the director of the Stonewall National Education Project.[23] The book details her life as a transgender child.[2][24][25]\nIn 2014, Jennings was a guest at the GLAAD Media Awards, sharing the stage with Zach Wahls and Lauren Foster.[26] That year she was also named one of \"The 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014\" by Time, and recognized as the youngest person ever featured on Out's \"Out 100\" and Advocate's \"40 Under 40\" lists.[27] She was also named in OUT's 2014 Trans 100 list,[28] named a Human Rights Campaign Youth Ambassador, and received LogoTV's 2014 Youth Trailblazer Award.[4][28]\nIn March 2015, Johnson & Johnson announced a deal for Jennings to appear in Clean & Clear commercials.[29] Jennings became a spokesmodel for Clean & Clear's \"See The Real Me\" digital campaign and shared \"the trials of growing up transgender.\" She also modeled for the NOH8 Campaign.[3] She also authored a piece for Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People List, writing the entry for Laverne Cox.[30]\nJennings and her family are featured in the reality series I Am Jazz,[29] which premiered in July 2015 on TLC TV and has aired four full seasons. The fifth season, chronicling the weeks leading to Jazz's surgery, premiered January 1, 2019.\nIn 2016, Jennings published a memoir, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen.[31]\nIn 2017, Robert Tonner and the Tonner Doll Company announced plans to produce a doll modeled after Jennings.[32] It is the first doll to be marketed as transgender.[33] The same year, Jennings voiced a teenage transgender character, Zadie, in the season finale of the Amazon Video animated series Danger & Eggs, who sings about acceptance, helping the two protagonists understand the meaning of a chosen family.[34][35][36][37] Jennings described the experience as \"groundbreaking,\" saying they were proud to be part of the show, especially in an episode that takes place at \"a Pride event,\" saying it makes the role significant, meaningful, powerful, and special.[38]\nIn 2019, Jennings made a guest appearance on the fifteenth season of the ABC program, What Would You Do?.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 2012, Jennings discussed her sexual orientation with Barbara Walters during her 20/20 interview, saying she is romantically attracted to boys and that she harbored some apprehension about dating because of her transgender identity. In a Q&A video posted to her YouTube channel in July 2014, Jennings stated that she is pansexual, and that she loves people \"for their personality\", regardless of their sexual orientation or gender status.[39]\nIn 2013, Jennings publicly discussed her wish of becoming a mother in the future.[40][41]\nIn an interview published in the April 11, 2018 People, Jennings revealed that per her surgeons' instructions, she had lost at least 30 pounds (14\u00a0kg) in order to have gender confirmation surgery, which was scheduled for June 20, 2018.[42] While the surgery was successful,[43] Jennings suffered complications that required another follow-up procedure.[44]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Instagram post\".

She had two younger brothers who were twins, one of whom had mental health issues and later took his own life.[4]\nJeska went to Lancaster Royal Grammar School where she was a cross-country runner. She went on to Oxford University, where she studied physics, gaining a first.[4] Jeska began studying for a doctorate at Oxford but dropped out of the course. She later attended Leeds University, gaining a master's in gender studies.[5][6]\n\nTransitioning and fell-running[edit]\nIn Easter 1998 Jeska came out to her parents as a trans woman, and had a gonadectomy in 2000. She went on to study gender studies at Leeds University. While at Leeds, she took up fell-running, finding immediate success, winning the Blackshaw Head fell race in 2008.[7] She later joined Todmorden Harriers athletics club, and went on to win the 2010 Three Shires Fell Race, the 2011 Liverpool Half Marathon, the 2010, 2011, and 2012 English, and 2012 British Fell Running Championships.[2] After moving to Wales she joined Aberystwyth Athletics Club.\n\nAttempted murder[edit]\nIn June 2015, UK Athletics told Jeska that she would be required to provide blood tests to prove that her hormone levels were within normal female range, as there was no documentation for Jeska's 2000 castration.[4] Jeska found this requirement distressing as she felt it would reveal her transgender status publicly. She failed to provide the samples required.[8]\nIn March 2016 she attacked Ralph Knibbs, a former professional rugby player and UK Athletics HR manager, with a knife because she feared UK Athletics would strip Jeska of her records and her eligibility to compete against female athletes.[2] Jeska stabbed Knibbs in the head and neck, resulting in a 2cm hole with blood pumping out.[9] Jeska also attacked Tim Begley and Kevan Taylor, employees of UKA who came to Knibbs' aid.\nIn September 2016, she pleaded guilty to attempted murder, plus two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Begley and Taylor, and weapons charges for knife possession.[10]\nOn 15 November 2016, she was scheduled to be detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983, but the hearing was adjourned for a month pending further psychiatric reports.[11] Jeska was found during these investigations to have autism.[12][13]\nIn March 2017, Jeska was jailed for 18 years for the crimes,[14] which severed nerves in Knibbs' body leaving him with restricted movement, difficulty eating, and limited vision in both eyes. It was revealed during sentencing that Jeska had twice asked for psychiatric help from the NHS prior to the attacks, but had not been referred for any treatment.\nJeska is currently serving her sentence at HM Prison Foston Hall.[15] Her racing results were declared null and void.[16]\n\nSee also[edit]\nTransgender people in sports\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"IAAF: Lauren JESKA \u2013 Profile\". iaaf.org.\n\n^ a b c Jeska, Lauren (22 September 2016). \"Fell-runner Lauren Jeska tried to kill British athletics official because she feared the body would revoke her titles over transgender status\".

She is a famous transgender celebrity.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Works\n3 Personal life\n4 Filmography\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBorn to ethnic Korean parents, Jin studied in a local Korean elementary school. Her father worked in the police department. She was praised as highly intelligent, and had won abacus contests many times.[1] She expressed high enthusiasm in dance performance. At the age of 9, she joined the People's Liberation Army to receive dance and military training from a dance company affiliated with the Shenyang Military district. At age 12 she transferred to the People's Liberation Army graduating in 1984.[2] After graduation she returned to the Shenyang military dance troupe, eventually attained the rank of colonel. Later she won the national dance contest with a Central Asian ethnic dance piece.\nIn 1987, Jin went to New York to study modern dance for four years,[3] studying under modern dance pioneers such as Limon, Cunningham, and Graham.[4] She then traveled and performed in Europe, and taught dance in Rome from 1991 to 1993, followed by a world tour, and returned to China at the age of 26.[5][page\u00a0needed]  She underwent sex reassignment surgery in 1995.[6] Her left leg was paralyzed for a while after the surgery.[7] In 2000, she moved from Beijing to Shanghai and opened her dance troupe.[8] At the age of 33, Jin adopted a son and then two other children she raised by herself until her marriage in 2005.[9] She currently lives with her three adopted children and German husband in Shanghai.\nIn 2013, she began her ascent to national fame while serving as a judge on China's first season of So You Think You Can Dance. Jin went viral when she scathingly commented on the show's host's attempt to turn a contestant's injury into a sob story. She commented, \"Chinese TV always digs at people's scars, consumes their pain. This is the biggest weakness of Chinese TV and I hate it! I hope that on 'So You Think You Can Dance' we won't use people's pain, we won't use people's sympathy, we won't use people's suffering.\" Audiences ate up her raw honesty and nine months later she had her own nationally broadcast show.[10]\nJin hosted her own television chat show The Jin Xing Show on Dragon TV between 2015 and 2017. In 2016, she began hosting the dating show Chinese Dating, where parents decide on a prospective wife for their sons. The show has come under criticism for portraying a conservative view on marriage and the role of women in the family.[11] She can speak Chinese, English, Korean, Italian and French.\n\nWorks[edit]\nJin's dancing works are \"startlingly original and provocative.\"[12] These include The Imperial Concubine Has Been Drunk for Ages (Guifei zui jiu, an adaptation of the famous Peking opera title) and Cross Border\u2013Crossing the Line (Cong dong dao xi, a collaboration with British pianist Joanna MacGregor).[12]\nHer film debut was in the Korean movie Resurrection of the Little Match Girl in 2002. In 2005, she appeared in the Thai movie Tom-Yum-Goong as the villain Madam Rose. She later participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007.\nJin and her husband Heinz were contestants on The Amazing Race China 3 in 2016, where they finished 6th.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAs a child, she said she would stay outside during rain, and wish that a lightning strike would turn her male body female.[1] She underwent sex reassignment surgery in 1995 in Beijing.\nDuring her time in America, she, at the time legally male, married an American woman in 1990 in a bid to obtain a Green Card. They divorced in 2000. She married her German husband Heinz Gerd Oidtmann in 2005. Since 2000, she has adopted 3 children from orphanages in China. In 2016 Xing and Oidtmann divorced, allegedly because as a legal couple, their children could not obtain Hukou due to the One-child policy; they still live together and remain intimate.

Jorgensen grew up in the Bronx, New York City. Shortly after graduating from high school in 1945, she was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II. After her military service, she attended several schools and worked; it is during this time she learned about sex reassignment surgery. Jorgensen traveled to Europe, and in Copenhagen, Denmark, obtained special permission to undergo a series of operations beginning in 1952.[1]\nShe returned to the United States in the early 1950s and her transition was the subject of a New York Daily News front-page story. She became an instant celebrity, known for her directness and polished wit, and used the platform to advocate for transgender people. She also worked as an actress and nightclub entertainer and recorded several songs. Christine often lectured on the experience of being transgender and published an autobiography in 1967.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Sex reassignment\n3 Publicity\n4 Later life\n5 Legacy\n6 In popular culture\n7 Bibliography\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nChristine was born as the second child of carpenter and contractor George William Jorgensen, Sr., and his wife Florence Davis Hansen. She was raised in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City. Jorgensen later described herself as having been a \"frail, blond, introverted little boy who ran from fistfights and rough-and-tumble games\".[2][3][4]\nChristine graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in 1945 and was soon drafted into the U.S. Army at the age of 19. After being discharged from the Army, Jorgensen attended Mohawk Valley Community College in Utica, New York,[5] the Progressive School of Photography in New Haven, Connecticut, and the Manhattan Medical and Dental Assistant School in New York City. She also worked briefly for Path\u00e9 News.\n\nSex reassignment[edit]\nReturning to New York after military service, and increasingly concerned over, as one obituary later called it, a \"lack of male physical development\",[6] Christine Jorgensen heard about sex reassignment surgery. She began taking estrogen in the form of ethinylestradiol and started researching the surgery with the help of Joseph Angelo, the husband of a classmate at the Manhattan Medical and Dental Assistant School.[6] Jorgensen intended to go to Sweden, where the only doctors in the world who then performed the surgery were located. During a stopover in Copenhagen to visit relatives, she met Christian Hamburger, a Danish endocrinologist and specialist in rehabilitative hormonal therapy. Jorgensen stayed in Denmark and underwent hormone replacement therapy under Hamburger's direction. She chose the name Christine in honor of Hamburger.\nShe obtained special permission from the Danish Minister of Justice to undergo a series of operations in that country. On September 24, 1951, surgeons at Gentofte Hospital in Copenhagen performed an orchiectomy on Jorgensen.[7] In a letter to friends on October 8, 1951, she referred to how the surgery affected her:\n\nAs you can see by the enclosed photos, taken just before the operation, I have changed a great deal. But it is the other changes that are so much more important. Remember the shy, miserable person who left America? Well, that person is no more and, as you can see, I'm in marvelous spirits.[7]\nIn November 1952, doctors at Copenhagen University Hospital performed a penectomy. In Jorgensen's words, \"My second operation, as the previous one, was not such a major work of surgery as it may imply.\"[7]\nShe returned to the United States and eventually obtained a vaginoplasty when the procedure became available there. The vaginoplasty was performed under the direction of Angelo, with Harry Benjamin as a medical adviser.[6] Later, in the preface of Jorgensen's autobiography, Harry Benjamin gave her credit for the advancement of his studies. He wrote, \"Indeed Christine, without you, probably none of this would have happened; the grant, my publications, lectures, etc.\"[8]\n\nPublicity[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Dorchen Richter and Danish artist Lili Elbe, both patients of Magnus Hirschfeld at the Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin, were known recipients of such operations in 1930\u201331. What was different in Jorgensen's case was the added prescription of female hormones.\nAfter her surgeries, Jorgensen originally stated that she wanted a quiet life of her own design, but once returning to the United States, the only way she could manage to earn a living was by making public appearances.[10] Jorgensen was an instant celebrity when she returned to New York in February 1953. A large crowd of journalists met her as she came off her flight, and despite the Danish royal family being on the same flight, they were largely ignored in favor of her.[11] Soon after her arrival, she launched a successful nightclub act and appeared on TV, radio, and theatrical productions. The first of a five-part authorized account of her story was written by Jorgensen herself in a February 1953 issue of The American Weekly, titled \"The Story of My Life\" and in 1967, she published her autobiography, Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Autobiography, which sold almost 450 thousand copies.[12]\nThe publicity following her transition and gender reassignment surgery became \"a model for other transsexuals for decades. She was a tireless lecturer on the subject of transsexuality, pleading for understanding from a public that all too often wanted to see transsexuals as freaks or perverts ... Ms Jorgensen's poise, charm, and wit won the hearts of millions.\"[13] However, over time the press was much less fascinated by her and started to scrutinize her much more harshly. She was often asked by in print medias if she would pose nude in their publications.[14]\nNew York radio host Barry Gray asked her if jokes such as \"Christine Jorgensen went abroad, and came back a broad\" bothered her. She laughed and said that they did not bother her at all.[citation needed] However, another encounter demonstrated that Jorgensen could be offended by some questions. When she appeared on an episode of The Dick Cavett Show, the host asked a question about the status of her romantic life with her wife, Jorgensen walked off the show's set. As she was the only scheduled guest, Cavett spent the rest of that show stating that he had not meant to offend her.[citation needed]\n\nLater life[edit]\n Knox and Jorgensen after being denied a marriage license, April 1959\nAfter her vaginoplasty, Jorgensen planned to marry labor union statistician John Traub, but the engagement was called off. In 1959 she announced her engagement to typist Howard J. Knox in Massapequa Park, New York, where her father had built her a house after her reassignment surgery. However, the couple were unable to obtain a marriage license because Jorgensen's birth certificate listed her as male. In a report about the broken engagement, The New York Times reported that Knox had lost his job in Washington, D.C., when his engagement to Jorgensen became known.[15][16]\nAfter her parents died, Jorgensen moved to California in 1967. She left behind the ranch home built by her father in Massapequa and settled at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, California, for a period of time.[17] It was also during this same year that Jorgensen published her autobiography, Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Autobiography,[18] which chronicled her life experiences as a transsexual and included her own personal perspectives on major events in her life.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Jorgensen toured university campuses and other venues to speak about her experiences. She was known for her directness and polished wit. She once demanded an apology from Vice President Spiro T. Agnew when he called Charles Goodell \"the Christine Jorgensen of the Republican Party\". (Agnew refused her request.)[19]\nJorgensen also worked as an actress and nightclub entertainer and recorded several songs.[20] In summer stock, she played Madame Rosepettle in the play Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad. In her nightclub act, she sang several songs, including \"I Enjoy Being a Girl\", in which, at the end, she made a quick change into a Wonder Woman costume. She later recalled that Warner Communications, owners of the Wonder Woman character's copyright, demanded that she stop using the character; she did so, and instead used a new character of her own invention, Superwoman, who was marked by the inclusion of a large letter S on her cape. Jorgensen continued her act, performing at Freddy's Supper Club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan until at least 1982, when she performed twice in the Hollywood area: once at the Backlot Theatre, adjacent to the discoth\u00e8que Studio One, and later at The Frog Pond restaurant. This performance was recorded and has been made available as an album on iTunes. In 1984, Jorgensen returned to Copenhagen to perform her show and was featured in Teit Ritzau's Danish transsexual documentary film Paradiset er ikke til salg (Paradise Is Not for Sale). Jorgensen was the first and only known trans woman to perform at Oscar's Delmonico Restaurant in downtown New York, for which owners Oscar and Mario Tucci received criticism.[20]\nShe died of bladder and lung cancer in 1989, four weeks short of her 63rd birthday. Her ashes were scattered off Dana Point, California.[21]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nJorgensen's highly publicized transition helped bring to light gender identity and shaped a new culture of more inclusive ideas about the subject.[12] As a transgender spokesperson and public figure, Jorgensen influenced other transgender people to change their sex on birth certificates and to change their names.[citation needed] Jorgensen saw herself as a founding member in what became known as the \"sexual revolution\".[12] Jorgensen stated in a Los Angeles Times interview, \"I am very proud now, looking back, that I was on that street corner 36 years ago when a movement started. It was the sexual revolution that was going to start with or without me. We may not have started it, but we gave it a good swift kick in the pants.\"[22]\nIn 2012 Jorgensen was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people.[23]\nIn 2014, Jorgensen was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields\".[24][25][26]\nIn June 2019, Jorgensen was one of the inaugural 50 American \"pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\" included on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn.[27][28] The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history,[29] and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.[30]\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nNation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, during his earlier career as a calypso singer under the name The Charmer, recorded a song about Jorgensen, \"Is She Is or Is She Ain't\".[31] (The title is a play on the 1940s Louis Jordan song, \"Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby\".)\nChuck Renslow and Dom Orejudos founded Kris Studios, a male physique photography studio that took photos for gay magazines they published, which was named in part to honor Jorgensen.[32][33][34][35]\nPosters for the Ed Wood film Glen or Glenda (1953), also known as I Changed My Sex and I Led Two Lives, publicize the movie as being based on Jorgensen's life.[36] Originally producer George Weiss made her some offers to appear in the film, but these were turned down.[37]\nThe Christine Jorgensen Story, a fictionalized biopic based on Jorgensen's memoir, premiered in 1970. John Hansen played Jorgensen as an adult, while Trent Lehman played her at age 7.\nIn Christine Jorgensen Reveals, a stage performance at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Jorgensen was portrayed by Bradford Louryk. To critical acclaim, Louryk dressed as Jorgensen and performed to a recorded interview with her during the 1950s while video of Rob Grace as comically inept interviewer Nipsey Russell played on a nearby black-and-white television set. The show went on to win Best Aspect of Production at the 2006 Dublin Gay Theatre Festival, and it ran Off-Broadway at New World Stages in January 2006. The LP was reissued on CD by Repeat The Beat Records in 2005.\nTransgender historian and critical theorist Susan Stryker directed and produced an experimental documentary film about Jorgensen, titled Christine in the Cutting Room. In 2010 she also presented a lecture at Yale University titled \"Christine in the Cutting Room: Christine Jorgensen's Transsexual Celebrity and Cinematic Embodiment\".[38] Both works examine embodiment vis-\u00e0-vis cinema.\nThe 2016 book Andy Warhol was a Hoarder: Inside the Minds of History's Great Personalities, by journalist Claudia Kalb, devotes a chapter to Jorgensen's story, using her as an example of gender dysphoria and the process of gender transition in its earliest days.\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\nJorgensen, Christine (1967).

She is the former executive editor of the think tank's website, BaseballProspectus.com,[1] the former managing editor for their annual publication, and is currently writing and editing for ESPN.com. She is a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.\nKahrl is an activist on civil rights issues for the transgender community in her hometown of Chicago and a member of the Equality Illinois board of directors.[2] The story of her coming out as a transgender sportswriter in 2003 was part of a GLAAD[3] award-nominated segment entitled \"Transitions\" on HBO's Real Sports that aired in 2010.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n2 Career\n3 Activism\n4 Notes\n5 External links\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nKahrl graduated from El Camino High School in Sacramento, California in 1985. She graduated from the University of Chicago in 1990, with a concentration in Modern European History and a minor concentration in Ancient History. She was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. In 2000, she earned an MA in Public History from Loyola University Chicago.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nFrom 2000 to 2005, Kahrl was employed as an acquisitions editor at Brassey's Sports (US), a mid-list publisher that focused on sports history and analysis.[6]\nAfter the launch of BaseballProspectus.com in 1996, of which she was a founding member, she contributed a regular column entitled \"Transaction Analysis,\" listing and analyzing the transactions (player trades, contract signings, promotions and demotions) by all Major League Baseball teams for the site. In 2011, she kicked off a new standalone opinion and argument column for the site entitled \"Purpose Pitches.\"[7] She was a co-editor of nine of the Baseball Prospectus annual volumes of baseball statistics and analysis.[8]\nKahrl has also written for SportsIllustrated.com, ESPN.com, the New York Sun, Salon.com, Slate, Playboy, and the Washington Blade, and was an associate editor of The ESPN Pro Football Encyclopedia.\nIn 2008, Kahrl was accepted as a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America and thus became eligible to vote on Major League Baseball post-season awards and nominees for the National Baseball Hall of Fame. She voted for the American League Rookie of the Year in 2009[9] and for the National League Manager of the Year in 2010.[10] Reflecting on the meaning of her election, Kahrl wrote, \"While I expect to still write about transactions, I really want to try and breathe new life back into the game story as an art form, and perhaps in my conceit try to take pages from Runyon and Lardner and Pete Palmer and Keith Woolner to provide something old and something new, all at once.\"[11]\nIn April 2011,[12] Kahrl announced that she would be joining ESPN.com to write and edit, teaming up with David Schoenfield in penning the \"SweetSpot\" blog, which provides a sabermetrics-driven analysis on the goings-on in baseball.\nOn November 10, 2016, Kahrl announced she has been promoted to MLB Senior Editor at ESPN and will be relocating to ESPN Headquarters in Connecticut.\nIn 2014 Kahrl was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.[13]\n\nActivism[edit]\nSince 2007, Kahrl has been active in the LGBT community, helping out with transgender programming at the Center on Halsted,[14] running the support group and adding a seminar series and an open mic night to its programming, as well as speaking about activist efforts in the area.[15] She has spoken to local student groups and on college campuses about acceptance of transgender people in society and in sports, and on transgender issues. She is a member of the board of Illinois Gender Advocates (IGA), and co-chair of IGA's action committee.\nAs an activist and board member for Equality Illinois,[16] Kahrl has been actively involved in an effort to curb police harassment of transgender Chicagoans, and has helped launch the Trans-Friendly Bathroom Initiative[17] with fellow activists from Genderqueer Chicago.[18] She has also helped organize the public observation of Transgender Day of Remembrance in Chicago. She has also discussed the nature of transgenderism at the Chicago History Museum, stating, \"You have to explain to people that, no, this (being transgender) does not mean that you are supergay, although it's sweet of you to say so. Forging acceptance in the face of inevitable confusion and concern is the diplomatic mission of a lifetime, for each and every transsexual.\"[19]  On November 8, 2013 it was announced that she had been named to GLAAD's Board of Directors.[20]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Kahrl, Christina. \"Changing Teams,\" BaseballProspectus.com, April 26, 2007.\n\n^ Dave McKenna, \"Baseball Columnist Switches Gender, Keeps Career,\" Washington City Paper, August 26-September 1, 2005.\n\n^ The GLAAD Awards: Outstanding TV Journalism - Newsmagazine GLAAD.org\n\n^ Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, Episode 156 Synopsis HBO.com\n\n^ Cox, Ted (2008-03-20). \"Here's a baseball guidebook with more than predictions\".

In 2012 she became American Apparel's first openly transgender model.[23] However, Media Advocates Giving National Equality to Transsexual & Transgender People (MAGNET), an anti-defamation organization dedicated to educating the media about transsexual, transgender, and intersex issues, launched an education campaign against the t-shirts King modeled because they say \"Gay O.K.\", which some feel is misleading since King is a straight transgender woman.[24] Chanel Jessica Lopez, a transsexual and transgender communities based counselor at New York City's Anti-Violence Project, called for a boycott of the t-shirts for the same reason.[24]\nKing is now signed with AEFH Talent for Theatrical, and PRESTIGE Talent for commercial work in Los Angeles.\nIn 2014, King was featured on the fifth anniversary cover of C\u2606NDY magazine along with 13 other transgender women: Janet Mock, Carmen Carrera, Geena Rocero, Laverne Cox, Gisele Alicea, Leyna Ramous, Dina Marie, Nina Poon, Juliana Huxtable, Niki M'nray, Peche Di, Carmen Xtravaganza, and Yasmine Petty.[25]\n\nCultural impact[edit]\nKing is one of a small but growing number of transgender people and characters in film and television, and her inclusion on ANTM has been called an \"unprecedented opportunity\" by Neil Giuliano, president of GLAAD.[26] By competing on the show, King has brought national and prime time attention to issues of gender transitioning and gender expression.[27][28] New York magazine has called King the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of Cycle 11, comparing her to previous contestant \"issues\" featured on the show such as Cycle 9 contestant Heather Kuzmich's Asperger syndrome.[29] ANTM executive producer Ken Mok stated her casting was done in support of \"redefin[ing] what beauty is,\" one of \"Tyra's original missions\" for the show.[30]\nDue to the intimate nature of the program, which films the contestants living together during the several weeks of the competition, GLAAD spokesman Damon Romine noted \"the show deals head on with the contestants confronting their own phobias. Facets of King's transitioning process have been portrayed in the show, such as her hormone injections and subsequent nausea.[29]There's going to be support, and the reverse of that. It opens the door for the other girls and the viewers to get to know King and the transgender community.\" Some of King's fellow contestants revealed prejudices and misunderstandings about transgender issues, and others commented about how her gender transitioning would be poorly received in their own small communities or in the southern United States.[13] Contestants have referred to King pejoratively as a \"he/she\" and a \"drag queen\".[31]\nNew York magazine noted that King is one of few transgender models in history to rise to public prominence, comparing her to Teri Toye, former club kid Amanda Lepore, and the gender-bending club promoter and model Andr\u00e9 J.[32] Simon Doonan, creative director of Barneys New York, told ABC News that the time may be right for a transgender supermodel: \"Maybe it's time for a tranny  [sic] to end up on the cover of Vogue.\"[30]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nKing is a practicing Christian and attends Mosaic Church in Los Angeles.[33]\nHer younger sister Chanel, died as a baby after being born with all of her organs outside of her body. Because of that, Isis King has participated in the Catwalk for Cause, where all the proceeds go to Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. [34]\nIn 2016, she began to focus on her acting and modeling skills and moved to Los Angeles.[35]\nShe is a motivational speaker and shares her experiences to schools across the country.[35]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm and television[edit]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\nNotes\n\n\n2005\n\nAmerica's Next Top Model\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\nBorn in the Wrong Body: On the Edge\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2008-2011\n\nAmerica's Next Top Model\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nBella Maddo\n\nCassandra\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\nHello Forever\n\nRommy\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nSonja\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nStrut\n\nMax\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nShameless\n\nGia\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nStop Bullying Now: Live from the Big House\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nHey, Qween!\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nThe Heart of a Woman\n\nRosie\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nEnemies of Dorothy\n\nWoke Daphne\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nDetox: She's Got a Habit\n\nVersace Girl\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\nGrown\n\nBea\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nDark/Web\n\nJersey\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nWhen They See Us\n\nMarci Denise Wise\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nSavage X Fenty TV Series\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nEqual\n\nAlexis\n\nDocuseries\n\n\nPodcasts[edit]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\nNotes\n\n\nDec. 4, 2017\n\nLGBTQ&A\n\nHerself\n\n\"Isis King: Paris is Burning Changed My Life\"\n\n\nunknown\n\nNot So Glamorous\n\nHerself\n\n\"I'm A Trans Model w/ Isis King\"\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of transgender characters in film and television\nList of transgender people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b B., Consuela (November 17, 2008). \"Isis King Is Transgender America's Next Top Model Contestant\".

Being a trans man, Krieger subsequently underwent gender affirmation surgery. Krieger says that, while he did experience gender dysphoria before being doped,[2] he regretted not being able to transition without the doping abuses.\n\nContents\n\n1 Athletics career\n2 Doping\n3 Personal life\n4 Broadcasting\n5 Notes\n6 References\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n\n\nAthletics career[edit]\nAt the 1986 European Championships in Athletics, Krieger won the gold medal in the shot put event after putting the shot at 21.10 m (69\u00a0ft 3 in). Krieger retired in 1991.[3]\n\nDoping[edit]\nKrieger was systematically doped with steroids from the age of 16 onward. According to Werner Franke and Brigitte Berendonk's 1991 book, Doping: From Research to Deceit, Krieger took almost 2,600 milligrams of steroids in 1986 alone\u2014 nearly 1,000 milligrams more than Ben Johnson took during the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nAs early as the age of 18, Krieger began developing visibly male characteristics. Eventually, years of doping left him with many masculine traits. By 1997, at the age of 31, Krieger underwent sex reassignment surgery and changed his name to Andreas.[2] Krieger had \"felt out of place and longed in some vague way to be a boy\", and said in a 2004 interview in The New York Times that he was \"glad that he became a man\". However, he felt that receiving hormones without his consent deprived him of the right to \"find out for myself which sex I wanted to be.\"[2] Krieger's sex change operation dominated Germany's news headlines and focused widespread attention on the legacy of doping in East Germany, leading other former athletes to speak out in public for the first time.\nKrieger gave evidence at the trial of Manfred Ewald, leader of the East German sports programme and president of the East German Olympic committee and Manfred Hoeppner, East German medical director in Berlin in 2000. Both Ewald and Hoepner were convicted of accessory to the \"intentional bodily harm of athletes, including minors\".\nKrieger was forced to retire in part due to experiencing severe pain from lifting massive amounts of weight while on steroids. Even today, he has severe pain in his hips and thighs, and can only withstand mild exertion.\nThe Heidi Krieger Medal (German: Heidi-Krieger-Medaille), named after Krieger, is now awarded annually to Germans who combat doping. Krieger's gold medal from 1986 forms part of the trophy.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nKrieger is married to former East German swimmer Ute Krause, who was also a victim of massive doping by East German sports officials.\n\nBroadcasting[edit]\nThe PBS series Secrets of the Dead featured Krieger in an episode covering the doping of East German athletes by the East German government covered-up by the Stasi.[citation needed]\nIn 2008 Ukrainian filmmakers released the documentary Doping. Factory of Champions based on  Krieger's story.[citation needed]\nKrieger\u2019s story was mentioned in the first episode of the BBC documentary The Lost World of Communism.[4]\nKrieger's half-sister through his father's second marriage, Susann Krieger, won the Deutsche Radiopreis 2017 (German Radio Prize) for her feature Gedoptes Gold \u2013 Wie aus Heidi Andreas wurde (\"Doped Gold \u2013 how Heidi became Andreas\"), about her brother's life and her reunion with him.[5]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Harding 2005.\n\n^ a b c Longman 2004.\n\n^ Kluge, Volker (2004).

She uses the name 'Matt' and male pronouns when referring to the time before her transition.\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n\n1.1 Military\n1.2 Powerlifting\n1.3 Seminar speaking\n1.4 Other\n\n\n2 Personal life\n3 Awards\n4 See also\n5 References\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nMilitary[edit]\nKroc served in the United States Marine Corps[13] from 1991 to 1995 and was selected for presidential security duty serving under President Bill Clinton. The tour of duty included time in Washington D.C., providing security for military officers at the Pentagon and for some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1992 to 1994. Assigned to security duty for Warren Christopher (then Secretary of State) during the United Nations conferences in 1993, Kroc was later assigned to the security force at the presidential retreat at Camp David from 1994 to 1995.\n\nPowerlifting[edit]\nKroc began entering powerlifting contests after joining the Marines in 1991.[14]\nIn 2002, she graduated from college and bought a home prior to the 2002 USAPL Nationals. Later, she went to London, Ohio, to train at a compound with Dave Tate and Jim Wendler.[15] Kroc also trained with Mountain Dog John Meadows,[16] Branch Warren,[17] and Johnnie O. Jackson.[18]\nKroc developed what she called \"kroc rows\", or dumbbell rows performed with extremely heavy weight and many repetitions.[19] She made a video showing 25 repetitions with 225\u00a0pounds,[20] and has been known to perform kroc rows with 300-pound dumbbells.[21] She also described lifting 300 pounds for 13 repetitions using straps; and both 205 pounds for 30 repetitions, and 175 pounds for 40 repetitions, neither with straps.[22] The 300x13 claim was verified at the 2010 Arnold Sports Festival.[23]\nIn 2017, after 18 months on estrogen, Kroc's performance was reduced to 210 pounds for 10 repetitions[24] and deadlifting 605 pounds.[25]\nKroc is a world champion, a world record holding powerlifter, and a National Physique Committee bodybuilder.\n\nSeminar speaking[edit]\nIn 2012, Kroc spoke at Learn To Train Seminar 4. Kroc then shared this online from December 2012 to March 2013.[26]\n\nOther[edit]\nKroc graduated from Ferris State University in 2002 and is a registered pharmacist working in the specialty pharmacy division of Walgreens. Kroc had careers as a sponsored athlete under contract with both EliteFTS and MuscleTech, and as an author and model, having appeared in and published articles in many magazines including Men's Fitness, Powerlifting USA, MuscleMag, and Muscle & Fitness. Kroc is also a featured author for T-Nation. She joined YouTube in 2006.[27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn interviews, Kroc has described growing up in a trailer in a rural conservative area.[7] Kroc started working out with cement-filled Sears weights at 6 years old, including doing 100 reps on a 10-pound dumbbell, and at 8 years old constructed a weight bench out of a 2x4 or 2x12[28] on cement blocks and made a barbell out of milk jugs filled with sand hung on a stick. Kroc weighed 118 pounds as a high school freshman, and, after graduating from high school at Standish-Sterling Central.\nIn 2004, Kroc was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Kroc had three children with a woman named Patty; they split up in 2006. Kroc also married a woman named Lauren.[29]\nKroc says she was the \"Manliest of the Manly Men\",[7] known as an \"Ultimate Alpha Male\"[7] before transitioning. Kroc came out as transgender to friends and relatives (including three sons[7]) around 2005.[7] In April 2015, Kroc legally changed forenames from Matthew Raymond to Janae Marie, a name chosen by Kroc's mother.[1] In July of that year, Kroc came out as both transgender and genderfluid. She is living as both genders,[30] saying she often feels like two completely different people trying to share a body, fighting for control.[31] Kroc goes by female pronouns,[13][32] but uses male pronouns when referring to her life as Matt.[33] In December 2015, Kroc's was the first featured among the top 63 most powerful comings-out of 2015.[34]\nPeople described an Instagram post where Kroc described undergoing facial feminization surgery more than one year before she publicly came out.[35] Earlier articles[36][37][38][39] state similarly. After an August interview by Dave Palumbo,[40] in September Kroc announced the start of a full gender transition, starting both surgical and hormone treatments, and stopping career lifting.[41] In an interview from October 2015, Janae mentioned being four weeks into estrogen therapy and taking a testosterone blocker.[42] That same month, Kroc was mentioned on the cover of Muscle and Fitness[43] which featured an interview[9] and a photo shoot.[8] Kroc was formerly on the advisory board for the magazine. This was the longest (highest word-count) story published to date in Muscle & Fitness, and the first to feature a transgender athlete.[44] A 2017 facial feminization surgery was delayed due to an infection from a cat bite.[45]\nKroc is the subject of the 2017 documentary film Transformer.[46]\n\nAwards[edit]\n2006 Arnold Classic WPO Powerlifting Middle Weight Champion\n2009 All-Time World Record setter in the 220lb class (surpassed in 2010)\nSee also[edit]\nCaitlyn Marie Jenner, another transgender athlete.\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Tuthill, Matt (October 6, 2015). \"Transgender Powerlifter Janae Marie Kroc Shares Unbelievable Story\".

This is the main LGBT rights organisation in Finland.[1]\n\nBiography[edit]\nKupila was assigned female at birth but experienced gender dysphoria from an early age.  At the age of nineteen, he initiated the legal process of change of gender from female to male. As a condition for this, he first had to receive a psychiatric diagnosis of transsexuality which equates the condition to a mental disorder.[2]\nIn addition, Finland has a second legal requirement for gender change which is sterilization. Kupila refused this, and was denied a change in legal gender. In response, he began an international campaign involving Amnesty International to have the Finnish law changed as infringing his transgender rights. The latter he considered as an integral part of his overall human rights.[3][4]\nThis was despite LGBT rights in Finland being regarded as some of the most progressive in the world.\nThe campaign ended in August 2017, when the Finnish government decided not to amend the law on gender transitions.[5][6]\nKupila is married, under Finnish same-sex marriage law, to Jaana Tiiri who is a disability rights activist. They reside in Helsinki, where he is undertaking medical studies at the University of Helsinki.[7]\nIn 2019 he was listed as among the top ten most influential medical professionals in Finland.[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Setan uusi puheenjohtaja on Sakris Kupila\" [Seta's New Chairman is Sakris Kupila] (in Finnish). 25 November 2018.

In response, she was placed on paid leave for 18 months. With the aid of lawyers from Lambda Legal, Ladin returned to work at Yeshiva University in 2008.[5]\n\nPoetry[edit]\nAs of 2018, Ladin has published nine books of poetry. (Some of these works appear under her previous name.)\n\nThe Future is Trying to Tell Us Something. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2017.)[6]\nFireworks in the Graveyard. (Headmistress Press, 2017)[7]\nImpersonation. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2015.)\nThe Definition of Joy. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2012.)\nPsalms (Wipf & Stock, 2010)\nComing To Life. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2010.)\nTransmigrations. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2009.)\nThe Book of Anna. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2007.)\nAlternatives to History. (Sheep Meadow Press, 2003.)\nIn 2013, Ladin published a series of poems formed entirely from words and phrases found in popular women's magazines. These poems, such as \"Ready To Know,\" link both trans women and cis women's experiences of gender to the \"commodity capitalist engine of the production of femininity.\"[8] This work emerged when Ladin gave herself a \"writing assignment\" to creatively engage with the \"how-to\" rhetoric of mainstream femininity.[9] In 2016, Ladin won a $25,000 creative writing grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.[10]\n\nMemoir[edit]\nIn 2012, she published the memoir Through the Door of Life: A Jewish Journey Between Genders.[13] In the book, she asserts that she is \"old-fashioned \u2013 a garden-variety transsexual, rather than a post-modernist shape-shifter,\u201d a claim which led critics to contrast her memoir with Kate Bornstein's.[11] Her memoir describes her family life, her transition, and her religious faith, including her perception that her \"gender identity crisis had destroyed [her] marriage.\" In 2012, Through the Door of Life was a finalist in the \"Biography, Autobiography, Memoir\" category of the National Jewish Book Awards.[12]\n\nScholarship[edit]\nAlongside her creative output, Ladin has frequently commented on the fields of trans literature and poetics. Ladin takes a non-identitarian stance, in that she does not believe that trans literature is necessarily being about trans experiences, or written by trans people.[13]\nIn her \"Trans Poetics Manifesto,\" Ladin defines trans poetics as \"techniques that enable poetic language to reflect the kind of complex, unstable, contradictory relations between body and soul, social self and psyche, that those who see ourselves as transgender experience as acute, definitive, life-changing.\"[14] Ladin has argued that poetry, and lyric forms in particular, might be the best mode through which to represent the transgender experience.[13]\nIn 2018, Ladin published her first full-length academic monograph, The Soul of the Stranger: Reading God and Torah from a Transgender Perspective (Brandeis University Press).[15] Her book offers trans readings of the Torah in order to argue that, despite traditional readings of Genesis and other biblical stories as enforcing a strict dichotomy between men and women, \u201cGod is not particularly invested in gender\u201d or the gender binary per se.[16] Ladin's exegesis instead positions Jewish religious patriarchy as a function of social norms, not the sacred texts themselves. In a divergence from traditional scholarly reading methods, The Soul of Stranger includes autobiographical reflection as well as close readings.[17]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nLadin has three children from her previous marriage to the writer Christine Benvenuto.[18] She is now remarried.[4]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Faculty Directory: Joy Ladin\".

As a child, she recalls believing she was a girl until her mother started making her wear boy's clothing when she started school.[1] In 1978, Laine graduated high school from Bedford-North Lawrence High School and went to study business at Indiana University, Bloomington. She struggled with gender issues and felt that a major university setting was not for her. She dropped out to attend cosmetology school.[citation needed]\n\nCareer[edit]\nLaine started a career in female impersonation in 1980 at a nightclub called Bullwinkles in Bloomington, Indiana out of a need to pay the rent for her apartment.[1]\nWhile on cast at the 21 Club in Indianapolis, Indiana, she won several pageants in the drag world, with her first being Miss Gay Bloomington 1985,[2] and her last being Miss Gay Indiana USofA 1988[3] In April 2010, Laine was crowned the first Miss Imperial Goddess.[citation needed]\nLaine was show director at The Ten nightclub in Indianapolis, Indiana from 1989 until November 2008 when she left to head the cast at Uncle Elizabeth's in Bloomington, Indiana.[4][5]\nLaine evolved into a well-known celebrity impersonator, mimicking entertainment icons such as Cher, Dolly Parton, and Reba McEntire, Lucille Ball, and Joan Crawford. Laine was a contributor to Stoppingthehate.com as a columnist and co-host of Stopping the Hate Television.[citation needed]\n\nFundraising[edit]\nIn 2007, Laine noticed a lack of funding for HIV/AIDS service organizations (ASOs) and formed Change4Change (C4C) to encourage people to donate money to ASOs in their own communities.[4][6][7]\nC4C was a major private contributor to HIV/AIDS causes. C4C and Laine were recognized in 2008 with the Celia Busch Award, which \"recognizes the hard work and commitment of a community member who works for the benefit those living with HIV and AIDS. One who consistently shows compassion, concern, empathy and commitment in the care of individuals and families, displaying superior interpersonal skills, and compassion in care.\"[8]\n\nSex change[edit]\nIn 1991, Laine began the process for sex reassignment surgery. The surgery was completed in 1996 by surgeons in Montreal, Quebec. She once was engaged to be married but continued to live the remainder of her life as a single woman in her hometown.[citation needed]\n\nMusic[edit]\nLaine's first dance single \"It's A Good Look\" was released on March 26, 2009.[9]\n\nDeath[edit]\nLaine died on July 24, 2017.

She was a key figure in the East Village art scene of the 1980s in New York.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Work\n3 Personal life\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nGreer Lankton was born in Flint, Michigan, to a Presbyterian minister and his wife.[1] It was during her rough childhood as a \"feminine boy\" that she began creating dolls. \"It was when I was about ten years old ... I used to make dolls out of hollyhocks and all types of flowers. Pipe cleaner dolls and things like that. I started taking it seriously by the time I went to college when I was 17.\"[2] Lankton was often teased by peers, and on more than one occasion experienced physical harassment.\nLankton studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and later Pratt Institute in New York.[1] She changed her name and had gender affirmation surgery at the age of 21, while she was a student at Pratt.[3][4]  She had previously been the subject of a local newspaper article about people transitioning to a new gender.\n\nWork[edit]\nGender and sexuality are recurring themes in Lankton's art. Her dolls are created in the likeness of those society calls \"freaks\", and have often been compared to the surrealist works of Hans Bellmer, who made surreal dolls with interchangeable limbs. She created figures that were simultaneously distressing and glamorous, as if they were both victim and perpetrator of their existence.\nIn 1981, Lankton was featured in the seminal \"New York/New Wave\" exhibition at P.S.1 in Long Island City and began to show her work in the East Village at Civilian Warfare, where she had solo shows in 1983, 1984, and 1985.[1] She gained an almost cult following among East Village residents from her highly theatrical window displays she designed for Einstein's, the boutique run by her husband, Paul Monroe, at 96 East Seventh Street.[3]\nBesides her more emotionally charged dolls, Lankton also created commissioned portrait dolls. These include a 1989 doll of Diana Vreeland that was commissioned for a window display at Barney's[3] as well as shrines to her icons, such as Candy Darling.\nCritic Roberta Smith described her works in the New York Times as: \"Beautifully sewn, with extravagant clothes, make-up and hairstyles, they were at once glamorous and grotesque and exuded intense, Expressionistic personalities that reminded some observers of Egon Schiele. They presaged many of the concerns of '90s art, including the emphasis on the body, sexuality, fashion and, in their resemblance to puppets, performance.\"[1]\nPhotographer Nan Goldin said \"Greer was one of the pioneers who blurred the line between folk art and fine art.\"[5] She appeared in Goldin's 1995 film \"I'll Be Your Mirror.\"[1] She also had work in the prestigious Whitney Biennial and the Venice Biennale, both in 1995, where her busts of Candy Darling, circus fat ladies, and dismembered heads gained her notoriety.[6][7]\nIn November 2014, \"LOVE ME,\" a major exhibition of Lankton's work including more than 90 dolls, documentation, and ephemera was mounted at PARTICIPANT, INC in New York City. It was organized by Lia Gangitano in cooperation with the Greer Lankton Archives Museum (G.L.A.M.), which was founded by Paul Monroe after Lankton's death.[3]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nLankton was friends with photographer Nan Goldin and lived in Goldin's apartment in the early 1980s, often posing for her.[7][8] She also played muse to photographers including David Wojnarowicz and Peter Hujar.[4]\nLankton married designer Paul Monroe in 1987 in New York City. The marriage ended in divorce around 1993.[4]\nLankton struggled with drug addiction and anorexia for many years, eventually becoming sick.[4] She died on November 18, 1996, of a drug overdose in her Chicago apartment, just a month after completing her final and largest work. Titled It's All About Me, Not You, this last work has become a permanent installation at the Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh.[9][10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e Smith, Roberta (November 25, 1996). \"Obituaries: Greer Lankton, 38, a Sculptor Who Turned Dolls Into Fantasy\".

She was also a selectman in Ward 4 in Nashua.[4] (Selectmen in New Hampshire city wards are solely responsible for organizing, counting, and calling elections.)[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Political career\n2 Bomb threat\n3 Return to politics\n4 References\n\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nLaughton was the first out transgender elected official in New Hampshire, and is believed to be the first out transgender person elected to a state legislature anywhere in the United States.[6] Her only known predecessor, Althea Garrison, was outed as transgender by The Boston Herald only after she had already been elected, and does not self-identify as transgender.\nAfter the election, media outlets reported that in 2008 Laughton had been sentenced to 7 1/2 to 15 years in prison for conspiracy to commit credit card fraud and 3 1/2 to seven years for falsifying physical evidence. The sentences ran concurrently and were later reduced to one year in the Belknap County Department of Corrections. She served four months before being released under the condition of 10 years of \"good behavior.\"\nLaughton did not disclose the conviction during her campaign, nor was she legally required to under the law. In New Hampshire, convicted felons are ineligible to hold public office until their \"final discharge\" from prison. Republicans claimed that the good behavior condition meant that Laughton had not received a \"final release\"; however, prison officials consider the \"final discharge\" to be when the inmate exits incarceration. On November 27, 2012, Laughton issued a statement: \"After a lot of thought and after talking with the state party chair and my democratic caucus director, I\u2019ve decided to resign my position of state representative-elect.\"[7]\nIn December 2012, Laughton announced that she would run in the election to fill the seat she resigned from.[8]  However, later that month state Attorney General Michael Delaney (D) issued an opinion stating that since Laughton's sentence had been suspended on condition of \"good behavior,\" she had not received a \"final discharge\" because she was still under the sentencing court's control until 2019.  On January 2, 2013, Laughton abandoned her candidacy.  While she would have faced a hearing before the state ballot law commission the next day, Delaney's opinion alone convinced her that she had no chance of staying on the ballot.[9]    The opinion lead to her selectman's post being nullified.[10]\n\nBomb threat[edit]\nLaughton turned herself in to police on March 12, 2015 after a warrant for her arrest was issued stemming from a bomb threat phoned in to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center on February 27.[10] She was initially charged with making a false report of explosives but a judge reduced the charge to a misdemeanor and sentenced her to a six-month suspended jail term.[11]\n\nReturn to politics[edit]\nIn 2019, Laughton paid $2,000 in restitution to be cleared to run for public office again and formed an exploratory committee in hopes of returning to city government.[11] She ran for, and won, her former selectman seat in Nashua that year. In 2020, she once again ran for the New Hampshire House of Representatives,[12] ultimately winning the seat.[13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Meet the United State's (sic) first transgender elected state legislator\".

Her mother had schizophrenia and spent much time in mental institutions.[7][8] She has one sibling, an elder brother.\nLepore later wrote: \"Ever since I can first remember, I knew I was a girl. I couldn't understand why my parents were dressing me up in boys' clothing. I thought they were insane.\"[8] In her early teens, Lepore began making costumes for a transgender friend in exchange for female hormones.[9] She was already isolated from her peers. At this time, her parents withdrew her from public school and hired a private tutor. They took her to a psychologist, who helped her obtain a prescription to begin hormone therapy.[10]\nAt the age of 17, and through a legal loophole, Lepore married a male bookstore owner. She was granted permission for gender affirmation surgery,[10][11] which she had at age 19 in Yonkers, New York.[11] Lepore later left her husband. In 1989, she relocated to New York City.\nIn the early 1990s, Lepore tried to establish herself as a nightlife figure (including being a member in the Club Kids). She supported herself by working in a nail salon, as a dominatrix,[10] and later as a cosmetics salesgirl for Patricia Field. After meeting photographer David LaChapelle one evening while hosting at Bowery Bar, she began collaborating with him.[10]\n\nModeling and acting[edit]\nLepore has appeared in fashion magazines, including French Playboy, Ponytail, DAMn and TUSH.

It was co-written with Thomas Flannery Jr. and published through Regan Arts. Throughout the text, the book features numerous pictures of Amanda taken by different photographers such as David LaChapelle, Tina Paul, Josef Jasso, Rob Lebow (who photographed the cover), and Joey Falsetta.\n\nMusic[edit]\nHer first single, \"Deeper,\" was a 2003 trance dance song written by Wigstock drag queen Lady Bunny.[16]\nIn 2005, Lepore released her first album, Introducing... Amanda Lepore, which contained \"Champagne\" and \"My Hair Looks Fierce\". In 2007, she released two remix albums, Fierce Pussy and My Pussy E.P.

Luxuria was a Communist Refoundation Party MP, belonging to  The Union coalition led by Romano Prodi.\nShe was the first openly transgender member of Parliament in Europe, and the world's second openly transgender MP after New Zealander Georgina Beyer. She lost her seat in the election of April 2008.\nIn the 2006 general election, Luxuria was elected to the Chamber of Deputies by the Lazio 1 constituency in Rome. She lost her seat in the 2008 election. After the retirement of Beyer and Luxuria, there were no transgender MPs reported in the world, until 2011, when Anna Grodzka was elected to the Polish parliament.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Political life\n\n2.1 Election in 2006\n2.2 Service\n2.3 Gay rights\n\n\n3 Filmography\n4 Theater\n5 Television\n6 Bibliography\n7 Discography\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\n Luxuria at Roma Gay Pride 2008\nLuxuria moved to Rome in 1985 to study foreign languages and literature. She also began to act, notably in cabaret, and through this developed her gender ambiguity as a hallmark. Her assumed surname, Luxuria, means lust in Latin.[2] She earned her first acting credit in Cena alle nove by Paolo Breccia in 1991; and began organizing parties and gay pride events, becoming director of the Muccassassina, the self-financing party of the Circle of homosexual culture Mario Mieli. She organized Italy's first pride festival,[2] in Rome on 2 June 1994, which attracted some ten thousand people.\nFrom 2001 to 2003 she toured Italian theatres with the musical Emotions co-starring with Sabrina Salerno and Ambra Angiolini.\nHer career as performer was not restricted to stage shows, and in 2005 she hosted a television show about nostalgia for 1980s music and culture on All Music. She also became well known for participating in charity organizations before making the transition to politics.\nLuxuria identifies using the English word \"transgender\" and prefers feminine pronouns, titles, and adjectives. She has stated on occasion that she perceives herself as neither male nor female. Upon entering parliament, she made the decision to stop wearing her trademark drag clothing \u2013 an extravagant cocktail of sequins, feather boas and bouffant wigs \u2013 saying that the legislature was \"not a discoth\u00e8que\" and that, \"It wouldn't be useful to provoke [people] in such a stupid way.\"[3]\nAfter her bid for re-election failed in April 2008, Luxuria appeared on L'Isola dei Famosi, which has been described as \"Italy's celebrity answer to Survivor.\" The show, which saw her pip Argentine model and showgirl Belen Rodriguez (former girlfriend of Italy footballer Marco Borriello) to first place in a public poll, took place in Honduras. Luxuria said of her victory that \"The Italian public has shown itself to be more forward-looking than our politicians, who thought I would turn up in parliament dressed like (former porn-star politician) Cicciolina.\" Pledging to donate half of her \u20ac200,000 prize-money to charity, Luxuria chose UNICEF, saying \"I know that I won't have children and I want to help disadvantaged children in my own way.\"[4]\nShe was chosen to host the 2012 edition of the Italian TV program L'Isola dei Famosi, on RaiDue.\nIn 2017, in an interview with Mauro Leonardi for an Italian weekly (Novella 2000), told for the first time her conversion to Catholicism.[5] The interview has aroused media hype and, during a broadcast on Rai1, she reiterated the content of her statements.[6]\n\nPolitical life[edit]\n The Honourable Luxuria with President of the Chamber of Deputies Fausto Bertinotti in 2006.\nElection in 2006[edit]\nAlthough her Lazio 1 constituency was seen as a safe Communist seat, her election was not without difficulties, particularly after it was disclosed that she had been a sex worker for a time shortly after arriving in Rome due to the difficulty of finding a conventional job as a transgender individual. Clemente Mastella, the leader of the centrist UDEUR party (a fellow member of the coalition) called her \"a ridiculous Cicciolina.\" Alessandra Mussolini, said, referring to Luxuria, that it was \"better to be a fascist than a faggot\" (meglio fascista che frocio).[7] However, Luxuria's name was placed second on the list of Communist candidates for Lazio, after party leader Fausto Bertinotti, which increased her chances of being elected (Italy uses a system of proportional representation).[2]\nDuring the election, she and another candidate were attacked by a group of fifteen people, allegedly including National Alliance politicians; they pelted her with fennel (in Italian finocchio, a word also meaning \"faggot\"). The politicians in question were suspended by AN; Luxuria criticized the police for the time it took for them to respond to the incident.[8]\n\nService[edit]\nHer service in the Italian parliament got off to a rocky start, when in October 2006 Forza Italia MP Elisabetta Gardini insisted that she should not be allowed to use women's washrooms in the parliament building and called for the creation of a third washroom.[9] Gardini described finding Luxuria presence there as a \"sexual violence\"; and later faced condemnations from coalition deputies for displaying prejudice tantamount to racism. Luxuria declared that she had used the toilets for years and that using the male lavatory would engender even greater problems.[10]\nIn the 2008 election, the Refoundation Communist Party joined a coalition of left-wing parties known as the Rainbow Left. However this group gained only 3.2% of the vote and lost all of its seats in parliament. Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right coalition swept to victory. Luxuria was not re-elected. Paolo Ferrero, then leader of the Communist Refoundation Party, said that he would be open to the idea of her returning to politics as a nominee for the 2009 European Parliament election after her win on L'Isola dei Famosi, but Luxuria said that she had no plans to re-enter politics.[4]\n\nGay rights[edit]\nLuxuria has long been a strong advocate for gay rights and a participant in events promoting equality for homosexuals. She helped organize Italy's first gay pride festival in 1994 and continued her activism throughout her tenure as a politician; in May 2007, she took part in the second Muscovite gay pride parade.\nShe used her prominence in Italian politics once elected as a platform for advocating gay rights. In the lead-up to her election, Luxuria made gay rights an issue of her campaign and felt herself to be a representative of the LGBT community, saying, \"We don't want privileges \u2013 we want our rights.\" In addition, Luxuria called for civil unions to be enabled for gay couples and for Italy to accommodate political asylum for \"all gays who try to get into Italy from countries where homosexuality is punishable by death.\"[3]\nLuxuria also campaigned prior to the elections for gays to have cohabitation rights, and had helped campaign by winning the support of Italy's left. Furthermore, Luxuria outlined her long-term support for full gay marriage rights, comparable with Spain's implementation of the law.[11] In September 2006, she stated that the Vatican's ongoing influence in politics, specifically in regards to gay marriage, contravened clauses of the Italian Constitution.[11] Luxuria reacted to Pope Benedict XVI's end-of-year speech in 2008, when he compared protecting the environment with saving humanity from a \"blurring of gender\" (homosexual or transsexual behaviour), by saying that such comments were \"hurtful.\"[12]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nCena alle nove (1991)\nCome mi vuoi (1996)\nTutti gi\u00f9 per terra (1996)\nSono positivo (1998)\nLa vespa e la regina (1999)\nGuardami (1999)\nPonte Milvio (1999)\nOgni lasciato \u00e8 perso (2000)\nMater Natura (2005)\nTheater[edit]\nEmozioni (2001\u20132003)\nChe fine ha fatto Cenerentola?

Beginning around 1978, when he moved from the family estate \"Ricefields\" on Thacher Street in Westwood, Massachusetts, to a home in Rhode Island, Lyman began to wear men's clothing, cut his hair short, and reportedly took steroids and grew a mustache. By 1985, he had the typical appearance of a male and went by the name Cam. It was during this time that Lyman began to associate with a man named George O'Neil. O'Neil became caretaker of Lyman's estate, and fed, showed, and took care of his dogs.  \nIn 1987, Lyman's relatives failed to receive the customary Christmas card from him. They investigated his disappearance and discovered that no one had seen or heard from Lyman in months. Police questioned O'Neil, who claimed that in the summer of 1987, he and Lyman had a fight over the phone about the dogs, and Lyman hung up on him. The next day, O'Neil went over to Lyman's house and found the phone ripped out of the wall and the doors wide open. O'Neil claimed that he believed Lyman had gone to Europe to undergo sexual reassignment surgery. However, O'Neil failed to provide police any proof that Lyman had gone to Europe. O'Neil also failed to explain why he had not informed anyone of Lyman's disappearance for nearly six months.\nIn December 1997, Lyman's body was found in a septic tank on his estate in Hopkinton, Rhode Island, by owners who had recently purchased the house.[4][5] His final will named the American Kennel Club's Museum of the Dog as the sole beneficiary.[1] The story was featured on Unsolved Mysteries, but as of 2011 no one has ever been charged in the case.[6][7]\nIn 2003, George O'Neil was indicted for embezzling $15,000 from Cam Lyman's estate. He was sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to pay $450 in court costs.[citation needed] He died in 2011 without giving any more information on Cam Lyman's death.\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of transgender-related topics\nList of transgender people\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Transvestite's millions go to the dogs\".

Signatories included Labour MPs Rosie Duffield and Preet Gill.[15] These incidents led to Madigan receiving online abuse.[7]\nMadigan attended the University for the Creative Arts, at which she ran the LGBTQ+ liberation group, as well as the women's liberation group, and was Campus Executive Officer. The students' union put out a solidarity statement with Madigan, commenting on the attention she received in the media.[16] In 2018, Madigan was listed as one of Teen Vogue's \"21 Under 21\".[4]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Transgender Schoolgirl Threatened With Suspension For Wearing Female Clothes\".

Regional School Unit 26 regarding gender identity and bathroom use in schools.[7] Maines, who is transgender, was barred from using the female bathroom after a complaint; however, the court ruled denying a transgender student access to the bathroom consistent with their gender identity is unlawful.\nMaines has since worked as an actress; roles include a television series guest appearance in Royal Pains and a regular role in Supergirl.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n\n1.1 Doe v.

Regional School Unit 26[edit]\nMain article: Doe v. Regional School Unit 26\nMaines was Susan Doe in the landmark case Doe v. Regional School Unit 26, which is also referred to as Doe v. Clenchy. When Maines was in elementary school, the grandfather of a classmate complained about Maines using the girls' bathroom.[9] Following that incident, she was barred from using the female bathroom and forced to use the staff bathroom. Maines and her family sued the school district, claiming the school was discriminating against her. In June 2014, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the school district violated the Human Rights Act, and prohibited the district from barring transgender students access to bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Maines and her family were provided compensation of $75,000 following the discrimination lawsuit.[12][13][14]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2015, Maines and her family were the subject of Becoming Nicole: The Transformation of an American Family, a book by Washington Post writer Amy Ellis Nutt. It chronicles the family and their coming to terms with Maines' being transgender.[15] In June 2015, Maines appeared on the USA Network show Royal Pains as a transgender teen whose hormones might be endangering her health.[16] In 2016, Maines was one of 11 individuals featured in an HBO documentary titled The Trans List. In the documentary, Maines and several other people relate their personal stories of being transgender.[17]\nIn July 2018 it was announced that Maines would appear as a series regular in the fourth season of The CW series Supergirl. She appeared as Nia Nal, a distant relative of Legion member Dream Girl, and as such played the first transgender superhero on television.[7] Her character is described as a \"soulful woman with a fierce drive to protect others.\" The character is a new reporter whom Kara takes under her wing.[18]\nIn 2019 Maines starred in Bit, a horror movie about queer female vampires, winning the top acting prize at the Outfest Los Angeles LGBTQ Film Festival.[19]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2015\n\nRoyal Pains\n\nAnna\n\nEpisode: \"The Prince of Nucleotides\"\n\n\n2016\n\nThe Trans List\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2017\n\nNot Your Skin\n\n\n2018\u2013present\n\nSupergirl\n\nNia Nal / Dreamer\n\nMain cast (season 4\u2013present)\n\n\n2019\n\nBit\n\nLaurel\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nLegends of Tomorrow\n\nNia Nal\n\nEpisode: \"Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five\"\n\nAwards[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nAwarding Organization\n\nSource\n\n\n2011\n\nRoger Baldwin\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Maine\n\n[20][21]\n\n\n2012\n\nP.E.

She managed Lennox Lewis to the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world. In August 2014, Maloney announced that she wished to be known as \"Kellie\" and that she was undertaking gender reassignment.[3][4] She appeared in the fourteenth series of Celebrity Big Brother in 2014.\n\nContents\n\n1 Boxing promotion\n2 Politics\n3 Personal life\n4 References\n\n\nBoxing promotion[edit]\nAfter splitting with Warren in the 1980s, Maloney moved into management and began promoting professional fights, becoming Lennox Lewis's manager in 1989.\nWhile known as the promoter who took Lewis to the top, Maloney has also guided four other fighters to World Titles and has managed a string of British, European and Commonwealth Champions. In 2009, the 'Boxing Binman', Rendall Munroe, made his fifth successive defence of his European Super Bantamweight title and later thrice fought for a world title, twice on an interim basis, drawing once and losing twice.[5]\nOn 14 September 2009 Maloney suffered a heart attack while watching John McDermott lose a contentious decision to Tyson Fury; significant heart damage was discovered when Maloney was admitted to hospital with shock after finding the body of boxer friend Darren Sutherland. It was reported that Maloney was not welcome at Sutherland's funeral service, although reports circulated that her wife, Tracey, and mother, Maureen, attended.[6]\nMaloney announced the decision to retire from boxing in October 2013.\nIn April 2015 Maloney announced that, following the completion of her gender reassignment, she will be returning to boxing to promote again.[7]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nIn the London mayoral election in 2004, Maloney was the UKIP candidate and was criticised for comments about lesbian and gay people. These included the explanation that a failure to campaign in Camden was because there were \"too many gays\". \nMaloney later told the BBC: \"I don't want to campaign around gays...I don't think they do a lot for society...what I have a problem with is them openly flaunting their sexuality.\" James Davenport, chairman of Gay Conservatives, called for Maloney's resignation as a UKIP candidate, saying: \"Frank Maloney is a dangerous extremist and should resign or be sacked as UKIP's candidate for London mayor. UKIP must back or sack their homophobic candidate.\"[8][9]\nMaloney was accused of \"Griffin-like racism\"[10] during the 2004 London Mayoral Elections, and was described[by whom?] as a \"dangerous racist\".[11][failed verification]\nIn an interview with LGBTQ magazine EQView, Maloney addressed her previous statements, stating: \"I accept comments I made in the past were wrong. If you knew Frank Maloney, if you were there when I made those remarks \u2013 you would have seen the smirk on my face. I knew it was wrong but I was saying it in jest [...] it was a mistake.\"[12]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMaloney was married for over 15 years to second wife Tracey; they have two daughters. Maloney has a daughter from her first marriage and is a supporter of Millwall Football Club.[13]\nMaloney said in her first televised interview as an open trans woman that she and Tracey are now divorced, but that she has been \"very supportive\".[14]\nIn August 2014, Maloney announced that she is now known as Kellie, and is undergoing gender reassignment. Lennox Lewis was initially shocked at the news but expressed respect for Maloney's decision.[15] On a radio interview she discussed her family's reaction with her mother Maureen.[16]\nMaloney had already received counselling, hormone therapy, and voice coaching. In April 2015, Maloney announced that her gender reassignment was now complete.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Frank Maloney: Manager and promoter retires from boxing\".

In early 2010, she leaked classified information to WikiLeaks and confided this to Adrian Lamo, an online acquaintance.[10] Lamo indirectly informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command, and Manning was arrested in May that same year.[11] The material included videos of the July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike and the 2009 Granai airstrike in Afghanistan; 251,287 U.S. diplomatic cables;[12] and 482,832 Army reports that came to be known as the \"Iraq War Logs\"[13] and \"Afghan War Diary\".[14] The material was published by WikiLeaks and its media partners between April 2010 and April 2011.\nManning was charged with 22 offenses, including aiding the enemy, which was the most serious charge and could have resulted in a death sentence.[15] She was held at the Marine Corps Brig, Quantico in Virginia, from July 2010 to April 2011, under Prevention of Injury status\u2014which entailed de facto solitary confinement and other restrictions that caused domestic and international concern[16]\u2014before being transferred to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she could interact with other detainees.[17] She pleaded guilty in February 2013 to 10 of the charges.[18] The trial on the remaining charges began on June 3, 2013, and on July 30, she was convicted of 17 of the original charges and amended versions of four others, but was acquitted of aiding the enemy.[19] She was sentenced to 35 years at the maximum-security U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth.[20][21] On January 17, 2017, President Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence to nearly seven years of confinement dating from her arrest on May 27, 2010.[8][22] After release, Manning earned a living through speaking engagements.[23]\nIn 2018, Manning challenged incumbent Senator Ben Cardin for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate election in her home state of Maryland.[24] Manning received 5.7% of the votes; Cardin won renomination with 80.5% of the votes cast.[25]\nFrom March 8, 2019 to March 12, 2020, except for a week from May 9 to 16, Manning was jailed for contempt in a detention center in Alexandria, Virginia and accrued a civil fine of $256,000, for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.[26][27]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n\n1.1 Early life\n1.2 Parents' divorce, move to Wales\n1.3 Return to the United States\n\n\n2 Military service\n\n2.1 Enlisting\n2.2 Move to Fort Drum, deployment to Iraq\n2.3 Contact with gender counselor\n2.4 Release of material to WikiLeaks\n2.5 Email to supervisor, recommended discharge\n\n\n3 Publication of leaked material\n\n3.1 WikiLeaks\n3.2 Reykjavik13\n3.3 Baghdad airstrike\n3.4 Afghan War logs, Iraq War logs\n3.5 Diplomatic cables\n3.6 Guantanamo Bay files\n3.7 Granai airstrike\n\n\n4 Manning and Adrian Lamo\n\n4.1 First contact\n4.2 Chats\n4.3 Lamo approaches authorities, chat logs published\n\n\n5 Legal proceedings\n\n5.1 Arrest and charges\n5.2 Detention\n5.3 Evidence presented at Article 32 hearing\n5.4 Guilty plea, trial, sentence\n5.5 Requests for release\n5.6 Commutation\n5.7 Release\n5.8 Appeal\n5.9 2019 jailing for contempt\n\n\n6 Reaction to disclosures\n7 Awards and tributes\n8 Gender transition\n\n8.1 2010\n8.2 2013\n8.3 2014\n8.4 2015\n8.5 2016\n8.6 2017\n8.7 2018\n\n\n9 Prison life\n\n9.1 Writing\n9.2 Suicide attempts\n9.3 Hunger strike\n\n\n10 Post-prison life\n\n10.1 Harvard visiting fellowship and rescindment\n10.2 Denied entry to Canada\n10.3 Restriction on speech\n10.4 U.S. Senate candidacy\n10.5 Contacts with far-right social media figures\n10.6 Tour of Australia and New Zealand\n\n\n11 See also\n12 Notes\n13 References\n14 Bibliography\n15 Further reading\n16 External links\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nEarly life[edit]\nBorn Bradley Edward Manning in 1987 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,[28] she was the second child of Susan Fox, originally from Wales, and Brian Manning, an American. Brian had joined the United States Navy in 1974, at the age of 19, and served for five years as an intelligence analyst. Brian met Susan while stationed in Wales at RAF Brawdy.[29] Manning's older sister, Casey Manning, was born in 1976. The couple returned to the United States in 1979, settling first in California. After their move near Crescent, Oklahoma, they bought a house with 5 acres (2 hectares) of land, where they kept pigs and chickens.[30][31]\nManning's sister Casey told the court-martial that both their parents were alcoholics, and that their mother drank continually while pregnant with Chelsea. Captain David Moulton, a Navy psychiatrist, told the court that Manning's facial features showed signs of fetal alcohol syndrome.[32] Casey became Manning's principal caregiver, waking at night to prepare the baby's bottle. The court heard that Manning was fed only milk and baby food until the age of two. As an adult she reached 5\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.57\u00a0m) and weighed around 105 pounds (48\u00a0kg).[33][34]\nManning's father took a job as an information technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, The Hertz Corporation,[35] which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Lego or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.[36][37][38][39][40]\n\nParents' divorce, move to Wales[edit]\nAs a child, Manning was opinionated about the intersection of religion and politics.[41] For example, she invariably remained silent during the part of the Pledge of Allegiance that makes reference to God.[42][43]\nIn a 2011 interview, Manning's father said,  \"People need to understand that he's a young man that had a happy life growing up.\" He also said that Manning excelled at the saxophone, science, and computers, and created a website at the age of 10. Manning learned how to use PowerPoint, won the grand prize three years in a row at the local science fair, and in sixth grade, took top prize at a statewide quiz bowl.[37][38][44]\n\n Haverfordwest, Wales, where Manning went to secondary school\nA childhood friend of Manning's, speaking about a conversation they had when Manning was 13, said: \"he told me he was gay\". The friend also said that Manning's home life was not good and that her father was very controlling. Around this time, Manning's parents divorced. She and her mother Susan moved out of the house to a rented apartment in Crescent, Oklahoma.[45][46][47][48][49] Susan's instability continued, and in 1998 she attempted suicide; Manning's sister drove their mother to the hospital, with the 11-year-old Manning sitting in the back of the car trying to make sure their mother was still breathing.[33]\nManning's father remarried in 2000, the same year as his divorce. His new wife, also named Susan, had a son from a previous relationship. Manning apparently took it badly when the son had his surname changed to be Manning too; she started taking running jumps at walls and telling her mother, \"I'm nobody now.\"[37]\nIn November 2001, Manning and her mother left the United States and moved to Haverfordwest, Wales, where her mother had family. Manning attended the town's Tasker Milward secondary school. A school friend there told Ed Caesar for The Sunday Times that Manning's personality was \"unique, extremely unique. Very quirky, very opinionated, very political, very clever, very articulate.\"[50][51] Manning's interest in computers continued, and in 2003, she and a friend, James Kirkpatrick, set up an online message board, angeldyne.com,[52] that offered games and music downloads.[53][54]\nThe only American and viewed as effeminate, Manning became the target of bullying at school. Manning had come out to a few friends as gay back in Oklahoma, but was not open about it at school in Wales.[55][56] The students frequently mocked her accent.[55] One time, they even abandoned her during a camping trip; of which incident, her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty campsite one morning, after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her.[37][44]\n\nReturn to the United States[edit]\nAfter graduating from high school in 2005 at age 17[40][57] and fearing her mother was becoming too ill to cope, she returned to the United States.[58][59] She moved in with her father, then living in Oklahoma City  with his second wife and her child. Manning landed employment as a developer for the software company Zoto. While there, she was apparently happy; however, she was let go after four months. Her boss told The Washington Post that on a few occasions Manning had \"just locked up\" and would simply sit and stare, and in the end, communication became too difficult. The boss told the newspaper that \"nobody's been taking care of this kid for a really long time\".[60][61]\nBy then, Manning was living as an openly gay man. Her relationship with her father was apparently good, but there were problems between Manning and her stepmother. In March 2006, Manning reportedly threatened her stepmother with a knife during an argument about Manning's failure to get another job; the stepmother called the police, and Manning was asked to leave the house. Manning drove to Tulsa in a pickup truck her father had given her, at first slept in it, then moved in with a friend from school. The two gained jobs at Incredible Pizza in April. Manning moved on to Chicago before running out of money and again having nowhere to stay. Her mother arranged for Brian's sister, Debra, a lawyer in Potomac, Maryland, to take Manning in. American journalist and Manning biographer Denver Nicks wrote that the 15 months Manning spent with her aunt were among the most stable of her life. Manning had a boyfriend, took several low-paid jobs, and spent a semester studying history and English at Montgomery College but left after failing an exam.[62][63][64][65]\n\nMilitary service[edit]\nEnlisting[edit]\n Manning in 2012\nManning's father spent weeks in late 2007 asking her to consider joining the Army. Hoping to gain a college education through the G.I. Bill, and perhaps to study for a PhD in physics, she enlisted in September that year.[66][67][68] She told her Army supervisor later that she had also hoped joining such a masculine environment would resolve her gender identity disorder.[69]\nManning began basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, on October 2, 2007. She wrote that she soon realized she was neither physically nor mentally prepared for it.[70] Six weeks after enlisting, she was sent to the discharge unit. She was allegedly being bullied, and in the opinion of another soldier, was having a breakdown. The soldier told The Guardian: \"The kid was barely five foot ... He was a runt, so pick on him. He's crazy, pick on him. He's a faggot, pick on him. The guy took it from every side. He couldn't please anyone.\" Nicks writes that Manning, who was used to being bullied, fought back\u2014if the drill sergeants screamed at her, she would scream at them\u2014to the point where they started calling her \"General Manning\".[71][72][73][74]\nThe decision to discharge her was revoked, and she started basic training again in January 2008. After graduating in April, she moved to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, in order to attend Advanced Individual Training (AIT) for Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 35F, intelligence analyst, receiving a TS/SCI security clearance (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information). According to Nicks, this security clearance, combined with the digitization of classified information and the government's policy of sharing it widely, gave Manning access to an unprecedented amount of material. Nicks writes that Manning was reprimanded while at Fort Huachuca for posting three video messages to friends on YouTube, in which she described the inside of the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) where she worked.[75][76][77][78][79] Upon completion of her initial MOS course, Manning received the Army Service Ribbon and the National Defense Service Medal.[80]\n\nMove to Fort Drum, deployment to Iraq[edit]\n Manning in September 2009\nIn August 2008, Manning was sent to Fort Drum in Jefferson County, New York, where she joined the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, and trained for deployment to Iraq.[81] In late 2008 while stationed there, she met Tyler Watkins, who was studying neuroscience and psychology at Brandeis University, near Boston. Watkins was her first serious relationship, and she posted happily on Facebook about it, regularly traveling 300 miles (480\u00a0km) to Boston on visits.[82]\nWatkins introduced her to a network of friends and the university's hacker community. She also visited Boston University's \"hackerspace\" workshop, known as \"Builds\", and met its founder, David House, the MIT researcher who was later allowed to visit her in jail. In November 2008, she gave an anonymous interview to a high-school reporter during a rally in Syracuse in support of gay marriage:\n\nI was kicked out of my home and I once lost my job. The world is not moving fast enough for us at home, work, or the battlefield. I've been living a double life. ... I can't make a statement. I can't be caught in an act. I hope the public support changes. I do hope to do that before ETS [Expiration of Term of Service].[83][84][85][86]\nNicks writes that Manning would travel back to Washington, D.C., for visits. An ex-boyfriend helped her find her way around the city's gay community, introducing her to lobbyists, activists, and White House aides. Back at Fort Drum, she continued to display emotional problems and, by August 2009, had been referred to an Army mental-health counselor.[87][88] A friend told Nicks that Manning could be emotionally fraught, describing an evening they had watched two movies together\u2014The Last King of Scotland and Dancer in the Dark\u2014after which Manning cried for hours. By September 2009, her relationship with Watkins was in trouble; they reconciled for a short time, but it was effectively over.[89][90]\nAfter four weeks at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was deployed to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she had access to SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army\u2014but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her.[91][92] In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.[93]\n\nContact with gender counselor[edit]\nIn November 2009, Manning wrote to a gender counselor in the United States, said she felt female and discussed having surgery. The counselor told Steve Fishman of New York magazine in 2011 that it was clear Manning was in crisis, partly because of her gender concerns, but also because she was opposed to the kind of war in which she found herself involved.[94]\nShe was by all accounts unhappy and isolated. Because of the military's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" (DADT) policy (in effect until September 20, 2011), Manning was unable to live as an openly gay man without risk of being discharged. But she apparently made no secret of her orientation: her friends said she kept a fairy wand on her desk. When she told her roommate she was attracted to men, he responded by suggesting they not speak to each other.[95][96] Manning's working conditions included 14- to 15-hour night shifts in a tightly packed, dimly lit room.[97]\nOn December 20, 2009, during a counseling session with two colleagues to discuss her poor time-keeping, Manning was told she would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness. She responded by overturning a table, damaging a computer that was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged her out of the room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material ought to have been withdrawn at that point.[98][99][100][101] The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.[102]\n\nRelease of material to WikiLeaks[edit]\nManning said her first contact with WikiLeaks took place in January 2010, when she began to interact with them on IRC and Jabber. She had first noticed them toward the end of November 2009, when they posted 570,000 pager messages from the September 11 attacks.[103][104]\n\n\nItems of historic significance of two wars Iraq and Afghanistan Significant Activity, Sigacts, between 0001 January 2004 and 2359 31 December 2009 extracts from CSV documents from the Department of Defense and CDNE database.\nThese items have already been sanitized of any source identifying information.\nYou might need to sit on this information for 90 to 180 days to best send and distribute such a large amount of data to a large audience and protect the source.\nThis is one of the most significant documents of our time removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetric warfare.\n\nHave a good day.\nManning, January 9, 2010[105]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2010, Manning downloaded the 400,000 documents that became known as the Iraq War logs.[105] On January 8, she downloaded 91,000 documents from the Afghanistan database, known later as part of the Afghan War logs. She saved the material on CD-RW and smuggled it through security by labeling the CD-RW media \"Lady Gaga\".[106] She then copied it onto her personal computer.[107] The next day, she wrote a message in a readme.txt file, which she told the court was initially intended for The Washington Post.[108]\nManning copied the files from her laptop to an SD card for her camera so that she could take it with her to the United States while on R&R leave.[107] Army investigators later found the SD card in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland.[109] On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a wig and makeup.[110][111][112] After her arrest, Manning's friend Tyler Watkins told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.[113]\nManning contacted The Washington Post and The New York Times to ask if they were interested in the material; the Post reporter did not sound interested, and the Times did not return the call. Manning decided instead to pass it to WikiLeaks, and on February 3 sent them the Iraq and Afghan War logs via Tor. She returned to Iraq on February 11, with no acknowledgment from WikiLeaks that they had received the files.[114]\nOn or around February 18, she passed WikiLeaks a diplomatic cable, dated January 13, 2010, from the U.S. Embassy in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland.[115] They published it within hours, which suggested to Manning that they had received the other material, too.[116] She found the Baghdad helicopter attack (\"Collateral murder\") video in a Judge Advocate's directory and passed it to WikiLeaks on or around February 21.[117][118] In late March, she sent them a video of the May 2009 Granai airstrike in Afghanistan; this was the video later removed and apparently destroyed by Daniel Domscheit-Berg when he left the organization.[119][120][note 1] Between March 28 and April 9, she downloaded the 250,000 diplomatic cables and on April 10, uploaded them to a WikiLeaks dropbox.[121]\nManning told the court that, during her interaction with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself.[122] Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange.[109] She wrote in a statement that the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.[122]\n\nEmail to supervisor, recommended discharge[edit]\nOn April 24, 2010, Manning sent an email to her supervisor, Master Sergeant Paul Adkins\u2014with the subject line \"My Problem\"\u2014saying she was suffering from gender identity disorder. She attached a photograph of herself dressed as a woman and with the filename breanna.jpg.[123] She wrote:\n\nThis is my problem. I've had signs of it for a very long time. It's caused problems within my family. I thought a career in the military would get rid of it. It's not something I seek out for attention, and I've been trying very, very hard to get rid of it by placing myself in situations where it would be impossible. But, it's not going away; it's haunting me more and more as I get older. Now, the consequences of it are dire, at a time when it's causing me great pain in itself ...[69]\nAdkins discussed the situation with Manning's therapists, but did not pass the email to anybody above him in his chain of command; he told Manning's court-martial that he was concerned the photograph would be disseminated among other staff.[124] Captain Steven Lim, Manning's company commander, said he first saw the email after Manning's arrest, when information about hormone replacement therapy was found in Manning's room on base; at that point Lim learned that Manning had been calling herself Breanna.[99]\nManning told former \"grey hat\" hacker Adrian Lamo that she had set up Twitter and YouTube accounts as Breanna to give her female identity a digital presence, writing to Lamo: \"I wouldn't mind going to prison for the rest of my life [for leaking information], or being executed so much, if it wasn't for the possibility of having pictures of me ... plastered all over the world press ... as [a] boy ... the CPU is not made for this motherboard\".[125] On April 30 she posted on Facebook that she was utterly lost, and over the next few days wrote that she was \"not a piece of equipment\", and was \"beyond frustrated\" and \"livid\" after being \"lectured by ex-boyfriend despite months of relationship ambiguity\".[126]\nOn May 7, according to Army witnesses, Manning was found curled in a fetal position in a storage cupboard; she had a knife at her feet and had cut the words \"I want\" into a vinyl chair. A few hours later she had an altercation with a female intelligence analyst, Specialist Jihrleah Showman, during which she punched Showman in the face. The brigade psychiatrist recommended a discharge, referring to an \"occupational problem and adjustment disorder\". Manning's supervisor removed the bolt from her weapon, making it unable to fire, and she was sent to work in the supply office, although at this point her security clearance remained in place. As punishment for the altercation with Showman, she was demoted from Specialist (E-4) to Private First Class (E-3) three days before her arrest on May 27.[127][128][129][130][131]\nEllen Nakashima writes that, on May 9, Manning contacted Jonathan Odell, a gay American novelist in Minneapolis, via Facebook, leaving a message that she wanted to speak to him in confidence; she said she had been involved in some \"very high-profile events, albeit as a nameless individual thus far\".[64] On May 19, according to Army investigators, she emailed Eric Schmiedl, a mathematician she had met in Boston, and told him she had been the source of the Baghdad airstrike video. Two days later, she began the series of chats with Adrian Lamo that led to her arrest.[132]\n\nPublication of leaked material[edit]\nWikiLeaks[edit]\n Julian Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg at the Chaos Communication Congress, Berlin, December 2009[133]\nWikiLeaks was set up in late 2006 as a disclosure portal, initially using the Wikipedia model, where volunteers would write up restricted or legally threatened material submitted by whistleblowers. It was Julian Assange\u2014an Australian Internet activist and journalist, and the de facto editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks\u2014who had the idea of creating what Ben Laurie called an \"open-source, democratic intelligence agency\". The open-editing aspect was soon abandoned, but the site remained open for anonymous submissions.[133]\nAccording to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former WikiLeaks spokesperson, part of the WikiLeaks security concept was that they did not know who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source.[134][135][136] Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange.[109] Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.[137]\n\nReykjavik13[edit]\nFurther information: Information published by WikiLeaks\nOn February 18, 2010, WikiLeaks posted the first of the material from Manning, the diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Reykjav\u00edk, a document now known as \"Reykjavik13\".[115][138][139] On March 15, WikiLeaks posted a 32-page report written in 2008 by the U.S. Department of Defense about WikiLeaks itself, and on March 29 it posted U.S. State Department profiles of politicians in Iceland.[140][141][142]\n\nBaghdad airstrike[edit]\nFurther information: July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike\nPlay media Manning said she gave WikiLeaks the July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike video in early 2010.[143][144][145]\nWikiLeaks named the Baghdad airstrike video \"Collateral Murder\", and Assange released it on April 5, 2010, during a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.[146] The video showed two American helicopters firing on a group of 10 men in the Amin District of Baghdad. Two were Reuters employees there to photograph an American Humvee under attack by the Mahdi Army. Pilots mistook their cameras for weapons. The helicopters also fired on a van, targeted earlier by one helicopter, that had stopped to help wounded members of the first group. Two children in the van were wounded, and their father was killed. Pilots also engaged a building where retreating insurgents were holed up. The Washington Post wrote that it was this video, viewed by millions, that put WikiLeaks on the map. According to Nicks, Manning emailed a superior officer after the video aired and tried to persuade her that it was the same version as the one stored on SIPRNet. Nicks writes that it seemed as though Manning wanted to be caught.[146][147]\n\nAfghan War logs, Iraq War logs[edit]\nFurther information: Afghan War documents leak and Iraq War documents leak\nOn July 25, 2010, WikiLeaks and three media partners\u2014The New York Times, The Guardian, and Der Spiegel\u2014began publishing the 91,731 documents that, in their entirety, became known as the Afghan War Logs. (Around 77,000 of these had been published as of May 2012.) This was followed on October 22, 2010, by 391,832 classified military reports covering the period January 2004 to December 2009, which became known as the Iraq War Logs. Nicks writes that the publication of the former was a watershed moment, the \"beginning of the information age exploding upon itself\".[148][149]\n\nDiplomatic cables[edit]\nFurther information: United States diplomatic cables leak and Guantanamo Bay files leak\nManning was also responsible for the \"Cablegate\" leak of 251,287 State Department cables, written by 271 American embassies and consulates in 180 countries, dated December 1966 to February 2010. The cables were passed by Assange to his three media partners, plus El Pa\u00eds and others, and published in stages from November 28, 2010, with the names of sources removed. WikiLeaks said it was the largest set of confidential documents ever to be released into the public domain.[12][150][151] WikiLeaks published the remaining cables, unredacted, on September 1, 2011, after David Leigh and Luke Harding of The Guardian inadvertently published the passphrase for a file that was still online;[152][153][154] Nicks writes that, consequently, one Ethiopian journalist had to leave his country, and the U.S. government said it had to relocate several sources.[155]\n\nGuantanamo Bay files[edit]\nManning was also accused of being the source of the Guantanamo Bay files leak, obtained by WikiLeaks in 2010 and published by The New York Times and The Guardian in April 2011.[156][157][158][159]\n\nGranai airstrike[edit]\nFurther information: Granai airstrike\nManning said she gave WikiLeaks a video, in late March 2010, of the Granai airstrike in Afghanistan. The airstrike occurred on May 4, 2009, in the village of Granai, Afghanistan, killing 86 to 147 Afghan civilians. The video was never published; Julian Assange said in March 2013 that Daniel Domscheit-Berg had taken it with him when he left WikiLeaks and had apparently destroyed it.[119]\n\nManning and Adrian Lamo[edit]\nFirst contact[edit]\n Adrian Lamo (left) and Wired's Kevin Poulsen (right) in 2001. The person in the middle, Kevin Mitnick, had no involvement in the Manning case.[160]\nOn May 20, 2010, Manning contacted Adrian Lamo, a former \"grey hat\" hacker convicted in 2004 of having accessed The New York Times computer network two years earlier without permission. Lamo had been profiled that day by Kevin Poulsen in Wired magazine; the story said Lamo had been involuntarily hospitalized and diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.[161] Poulsen, by then a reporter, was himself a former hacker who had used Lamo as a source several times since 2000.[160] Indeed it was Poulsen who, in 2002, had told The New York Times that Lamo had gained unauthorized access to its network; Poulsen then wrote the story up for SecurityFocus. Lamo would hack into a system, tell the organization, then offer to fix their security, often using Poulsen as a go-between.[162]\nLamo said Manning sent him several encrypted emails on May 20. He said he was unable to decrypt them but replied anyway and invited the emailer to chat on AOL IM. Lamo said he later turned the emails over to the FBI without having read them.[163]\n\nChats[edit]\nIn a series of chats between May 21 and 25, Manning\u2014using the handle \"bradass87\"\u2014told Lamo that she had leaked classified material. She introduced herself as an Army intelligence analyst, and within 17 minutes, without waiting for a reply, alluded to the leaks.[125]\n\n\nMay 21, 2010:\n(1:41:12 PM) bradass87: hi\n(1:44:04 PM) bradass87: how are you?\n(1:47:01 PM) bradass87: im an army intelligence analyst, deployed to eastern baghdad, pending discharge for \"adjustment disorder\" in lieu of \"gender identity disorder\"\n(1:56:24 PM) bradass87: im sure you're pretty busy ...\n\n(1:58:31 PM) bradass87: if you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day 7 days a week for 8+ months, what would you do?[125]\n\nLamo replied several hours later. He said: \"I'm a journalist and a minister. You can pick either, and treat this as a confession or an interview (never to be published) & enjoy a modicum of legal protection.\" They talked about restricted material in general, then Manning made her first explicit reference to the leaks: \"This is what I do for friends.\" She linked to a section of the May 21, 2010, version of Wikipedia's article on WikiLeaks, which described the WikiLeaks release in March that year of a Department of Defense report on WikiLeaks itself. She added \"the one below that is mine too\"; the section below in the same article referred to the leak of the Baghdad airstrike (\"Collateral Murder\") video.[164] Manning said she felt isolated and fragile, and was reaching out to someone she hoped might understand.[125]\n\n\nMay 22, 2010:\n(11:49:02 AM) bradass87: im in the desert, with a bunch of hyper-masculine trigger happy ignorant rednecks as neighbors... and the only safe place i seem to have is this satellite internet connection\n(11:49:51 AM) bradass87: and i already got myself into minor trouble, revealing my uncertainty over my gender identity ... which is causing me to lose this job ... and putting me in an awkward limbo ...\n(11:52:23 AM) bradass87: at the very least, i managed to keep my security clearance [so far] ...\n(11:58:33 AM) bradass87: and little does anyone know, but among this \"visible\" mess, theres the mess i created that no-one knows about yet ...\n(12:15:11 PM) bradass87: hypothetical question: if you had free reign [sic] over classified networks for long periods of time ... say, 8\u20139 months ... and you saw incredible things, awful things ... things that belonged in the public domain, and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington DC ... what would you do? ...\n(12:21:24 PM) bradass87: say ... a database of half a million events during the iraq war ... from 2004 to 2009 ... with reports, date time groups, lat-lon locations, casualty figures ...? or 260,000 state department cables from embassies and consulates all over the world, explaining how the first world exploits the third, in detail, from an internal perspective? ...\n(12:26:09 PM) bradass87: lets just say *someone* i know intimately well, has been penetrating US classified networks, mining data like the ones described ... and been transferring that data from the classified networks over the \"air gap\" onto a commercial network computer ... sorting the data, compressing it, encrypting it, and uploading it to a crazy white haired aussie who can't seem to stay in one country very long ...\n(12:31:43 PM) bradass87: crazy white haired dude = Julian Assange\n\n(12:33:05 PM) bradass87: in other words ... ive made a huge mess\u00a0:'[125]\n\nManning said she had started to help WikiLeaks around Thanksgiving in November 2009\u2014which fell on November 26 that year\u2014after WikiLeaks had released the 9/11 pager messages; the messages were released on November 25. She told Lamo she had recognized that the messages came from an NSA database and that seeing them had made her feel comfortable about stepping forward. Lamo asked what kind of material Manning was dealing with; Manning replied: \"uhm\u00a0... crazy, almost criminal political backdealings\u00a0... the non-PR-versions of world events and crises\u00a0...\" Although she said she dealt with Assange directly, Manning also said Assange had adopted a deliberate policy of knowing very little about her, telling Manning: \"lie to me.\"[125]\n\n\nMay 22, 2010:\n(1:11:54 PM) bradass87: and ... its important that it gets out ... i feel, for some bizarre reason\n(1:12:02 PM) bradass87: it might actually change something\n(1:13:10 PM) bradass87: i just ... dont wish to be a part of it ... at least not now ... im not ready ... i wouldn't mind going to prison for the rest of my life, or being executed so much, if it wasn't for the possibility of having pictures of me ... plastered all over the world press ... as [a] boy ...\n(1:14:11 PM) bradass87: i've totally lost my mind ... i make no sense ... the CPU is not made for this motherboard ... [...]\n\n(1:39:03 PM) bradass87: i cant believe what im confessing to you\u00a0:'[125]\n\nLamo again assured her that she was speaking in confidence. Manning wrote: \"but im not a source for you ... im talking to you as someone who needs moral and emotional fucking support,\" and Lamo replied: \"i told you, none of this is for print.\"[125]\nManning said the incident that had affected her the most was when 15 detainees had been arrested by the Iraqi Federal Police for printing anti-Iraqi literature. She was asked by the Army to find out who the \"bad guys\" were, and discovered that the detainees had followed what Manning said was a corruption trail within the Iraqi cabinet. She reported this to her commanding officer, but said \"he didn't want to hear any of it\"; she said the officer told her to help the Iraqi police find more detainees. Manning said it made her realize, \"i was actively involved in something that i was completely against\u00a0...\"[125]\nShe explained that \"i cant separate myself from others ... i feel connected to everybody ... like they were distant family,\" and cited Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman and Elie Wiesel. She said she hoped the material would lead to \"hopefully worldwide discussion, debates, and reforms. if not ... than [sic] we're doomed as a species.\" She said she had downloaded the material onto music CD-RWs, erased the music and replaced it with a compressed split file. Part of the reason no one noticed, she said, was that staff were working 14 hours a day, seven days a week, and \"people stopped caring after 3 weeks.\"[125]\n\n\nMay 25, 2010:\n(02:12:23 PM) bradass87: so ... it was a massive data spillage ... facilitated by numerous factors ... both physically, technically, and culturally\n(02:13:02 PM) bradass87: perfect example of how not to do INFOSEC\n(02:14:21 PM) bradass87: listened and lip-synced to Lady Gaga's Telephone while exfiltratrating possibly the largest data spillage in american history [...]\n(02:17:56 PM) bradass87: weak servers, weak logging, weak physical security, weak counter-intelligence, inattentive signal analysis ... a perfect storm [...]\n(02:22:47 PM) bradass87: i mean what if i were someone more malicious\n(02:23:25 PM) bradass87: i could've sold to russia or china, and made bank?\n(02:23:36 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: why didn't you?\n(02:23:58 PM) bradass87: because it's public data [...]\n(02:24:46 PM) bradass87: it belongs in the public domain\n\n(02:25:15 PM) bradass87: Information should be free[125]\n\nLamo approaches authorities, chat logs published[edit]\nShortly after the first chat with Manning, Lamo discussed the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group Project Vigilant, which researches cybercrime, and with Timothy Webster, a friend who had worked in Army counterintelligence.[165] Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter.[11] He told them he believed Manning was endangering lives.[166] He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. Nicks argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.[167]\nLamo met with FBI and Army investigators on May 25 in California, and showed them the chat logs. On or around that date he also passed the story to Kevin Poulsen of Wired, and on May 27 gave him the chat logs and Manning's name under embargo. He met with the FBI again that day, at which point they told him Manning had been arrested in Iraq the day before. Poulsen and Kim Zetter broke the news of the arrest in Wired on June 6.[168] Wired published around 25 percent of the chat logs on June 6 and 10, and the full logs in July 2011.[169]\n\nLegal proceedings[edit]\nArrest and charges[edit]\nFurther information: List of charges in United States v. Manning\nManning was arrested by the Army's Criminal Investigation Command,[170] on May 27, 2010, and transferred four days later to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait.[171] She was charged with several offenses in July, replaced by 22 charges in March 2011, including violations of Articles 92 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and of the Espionage Act. The most serious charge was \"aiding the enemy\", a capital offense, although prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty.[172] Another charge, which Manning's defense called a \"made up offense\"[173] but of which she was found guilty, read that Manning \"wantonly [caused] to be published on the internet intelligence belonging to the US government, having knowledge that intelligence published on the internet is accessible to the enemy\".[174]\n\nDetention[edit]\n Manning\u2013WikiLeaks timeline\n2009\nOct: Manning sent to Iraq.\nNov: Manning finds Baghdad airstrike video.\nNov 25: WikiLeaks (WL) publishes 9/11 pager messages.\nNov: Manning allegedly contacts WL.\n\n2010\nFeb 18: WL releases Reykjavik 13 cable, purportedly from Manning.\nMar 15: WL releases Defense Dept report about WL, purportedly from Manning.\nMar 29: WL releases State Dept profiles, purportedly from Manning.\nApr 5: WL releases Baghdad airstrike video, purportedly from Manning.\n21\u201325 May: Manning and Adrian Lamo chat.\n27 May: Manning arrested in Iraq.\nJun 6: Wired publishes partial Manning- Lamo chat logs.\nJul 5: Manning charged.\nJul 25: WL releases Afghan War logs, purportedly from Manning.\nJul 29: Manning transferred to the US.\nOct 22: WL releases Iraq War logs, purportedly from Manning.\nNov 28: Newspapers publish US diplomatic cables from WL, purportedly from Manning.\n\n2011\nJan: UN Special Rapporteur submits inquiry to US about Manning.\nMar 1: Manning charged with more offenses.\nDec 16: Article 32 hearing begins.\n\n2012\nFeb: Manning ordered to stand trial.\n\n2013\nFeb 28: Manning pleads guilty to 10 of 22 charges.\nJun 3: Trial begins.\nJul 30: Manning convicted on most charges; acquitted of aiding the enemy.\nAug 21: Manning sentenced to 35 years.\nSep 4: Manning and her lawyers started seeking a presidential pardon.\n\nWhile in Kuwait, Manning was placed on suicide watch after her behavior caused concern.[175] She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is one stop short of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes. Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning was not allowed to sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded.[176] Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment.[177]\nHer cell was 6 \u00d7 12\u00a0ft (1.8 x 3.6\u00a0m) with no window, containing a bed, toilet, and sink. The jail had 30 cells built in a U shape, and although detainees could talk to one another, they were unable to see each other. Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day, meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits. There was access to television when it was placed in the corridor, and she was allowed to keep one magazine and one book.[176] Because she was in pretrial detention, she received full pay.[178]\nOn January 18, 2011, after Manning had an altercation with the guards, the commander of Quantico classified her as a suicide risk.[179] Manning said the guards had begun issuing conflicting commands, such as \"turn left, don't turn left,\" and upbraiding her for responding to commands with \"yes\" instead of \"aye\". Shortly afterward, she was placed on suicide watch, had her clothing and eyeglasses removed, and was required to remain in her cell 24 hours a day. The suicide watch was lifted on January 21 after a complaint from her lawyer, and the brig commander who ordered it was replaced.[180]\nOn March 2, she was told that her request for removal of POI status\u2014which entailed among other things sleeping wearing only boxer shorts\u2014had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, if she wanted to harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.[181]\nThe detention conditions prompted national and international concern. Juan E. M\u00e9ndez, United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, told The Guardian that the U.S. government's treatment of Manning was \"cruel, inhuman and degrading\".[182] In January 2011 Amnesty International asked the British government to intervene because of Manning's status as a British citizen by descent, although Manning's lawyer said Manning did not regard herself as a British citizen.[183] On March 10, State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley criticized Manning's treatment as \"ridiculous, counterproductive and stupid\".[184] The following day, President Obama responded to Crowley's comments, saying the Pentagon had assured him that Manning's treatment was \"appropriate and meet[s] our basic standards\". Under political pressure, Crowley resigned three days after his comments.[185] On March 15, 295 members of the academic legal community signed a statement arguing that Manning was being subjected to \"degrading and inhumane pretrial punishment\" and criticizing Obama's comments.[186] On April 20 the Pentagon transferred Manning to the medium-custody Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she was placed in an 80-square-foot cell with a window and a normal mattress, able to mix with other pretrial detainees and keep personal objects in her cell.[187]\n\nEvidence presented at Article 32 hearing[edit]\nIn April 2011, a panel of experts, having completed a medical and mental evaluation of Manning, ruled that she was fit to stand trial.[188] An Article 32 hearing, presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Almanza, was convened on December 16, 2011, at Fort Meade, Maryland; the hearing resulted in Almanza's recommending that Manning be referred to a general court-martial. She was arraigned on February 23, 2012, and declined to enter a plea.[189]\nDuring the Article 32 hearing, the prosecution, led by Captain Ashden Fein, presented 300,000 pages of documents in evidence, including chat logs and classified material.[190] The court heard from two Army investigators, Special Agent David Shaver, head of the digital forensics and research branch of the Army's Computer Crime Investigative Unit (CCIU); and Mark Johnson, a digital forensics contractor from ManTech International, who works for the CCIU. They testified that they had found 100,000 State Department cables on a workplace computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010; 400,000 military reports from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan on an SD card found in her basement room in her aunt's home in Potomac, Maryland; and 10,000 cables on her personal MacBook Pro and storage devices that they said had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted. They also recovered 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on Manning's MacBook hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club's domain (ccc.de), were associated with the names Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank.[109]\nJohnson said he found SSH logs on the MacBook that showed an SFTP connection, from an IP address that resolved to Manning's aunt's home, to a Swedish IP address with links to WikiLeaks.[109] Also found was a text file named \"Readme\", attached to the logs and apparently written by Manning to Assange, which called the Iraq and Afghan War logs \"possibly one of the most significant documents of our time, removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetric warfare\".[105] The investigators testified they had also recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric Schmiedl, a Boston mathematician, in which Manning said she was the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack (\"Collateral Murder\") video. Johnson said there had been two attempts to delete the material from the MacBook. The operating system had been re-installed in January 2010, and on or around January 31, 2010, an attempt had been made to erase the hard drive by doing a \"zero-fill\", which involves overwriting material with zeroes. The material was recovered after the overwrite attempts from unallocated space.[109]\nManning's lawyers argued that the government had overstated the harm the release of the documents had caused and had overcharged Manning to force her to give evidence against Assange. The defense also raised questions about whether Manning's confusion over her gender identity affected her behavior and decision making.[191]\n\nGuilty plea, trial, sentence[edit]\nMain article: United States v. Manning\nUnited States v. ManningCourtUnited States Army Military District of WashingtonFull case nameUnited States of America v. Manning, Bradley E., PFC DecidedJuly 30, 2013Case historyPrior action(s)Article 32 hearing, opened December 16, 2011Formally charged, February 23, 2012Article 39 (pretrial) hearing, opened April 24, 2012Court membershipJudge sittingColonel Denise Lind\nThe judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, ruled in January 2013 that any sentence would be reduced by 112 days because of the treatment Manning received at Quantico.[192] On February 28, Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges.[18] Reading for over an hour from a 35-page statement, she said she had leaked the cables \"to show the true cost of war\". Prosecutors pursued a court-martial on the remaining charges.[193]\nThe trial began on June 3, 2013. Manning was convicted on July 30, on 17 of the 22 charges in their entirety, including five counts of espionage and theft, and an amended version of four other charges; she was acquitted of aiding the enemy. The sentencing phase began the next day.[1]\nCaptain Michael Worsley, a military psychologist who had treated Manning before her arrest, testified that Manning had been left isolated in the Army, trying to deal with gender identity issues in a \"hyper-masculine environment\".[194] David Moulton, a Navy forensic psychiatrist who saw Manning after the arrest, said Manning had narcissistic traits, and showed signs of both fetal alcohol syndrome and Asperger syndrome. He said that, in leaking the material, Manning had been \"acting out [a] grandiose ideation\".[195]\n\nA defense psychiatrist, testifying to Manning's motives, suggested a different agenda:Well, Pfc Manning was under the impression that his leaked information was going to really change how the world views the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and future wars, actually. This was an attempt to crowdsource analysis of the war, and it was his opinion that if ... through crowdsourcing, enough analysis was done on these documents, which he felt to be very important, that it would lead to a greater good ... that society as a whole would come to the conclusion that the war wasn't worth it ... that really no wars are worth it.[196]\nOn August 14, Manning apologized to the court: \"I am sorry that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that they hurt the United States. I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions. When I made these decisions I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people. ... At the time of my decisions, I was dealing with a lot of issues.\"[194]\nManning's offenses carried a maximum sentence of 90 years.[197] The government asked for 60 years as a deterrent to others, while Manning's lawyer asked for no more than 25 years. She was sentenced on August 21 to 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private (private E-1 or PVT), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge.[2] She was given credit for 1,293 days of pretrial confinement, including 112 days for her treatment at Quantico, and would have been eligible for parole after serving one-third of the sentence.[2] She was confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.[21]\nThe sentence was criticized as \"unjust and unfair\"[198] by The Guardian, and as \"excessive\"[199] by The New York Times.\nOn April 14, 2014, Manning's request for clemency was denied; the case went to the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals for further review.[200]\n\nRequests for release[edit]\nOn September 3, 2013, Manning's lawyer filed a Petition for Commutation of Sentence to President Obama through the pardon attorney at the Department of Justice and Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh.[201][202] The petition contended that Manning's disclosures did not cause any \"real damage\", and that the documents in question did not merit protection as they were not sensitive. The request included a supporting letter from Amnesty International which said that Manning's leaks had exposed violations of human rights. David Coombs's cover letter touched on Manning's role as a whistleblower, asking that Manning be granted a full pardon or that her sentence be reduced to time served.[203][204]\nIn April 2015, Amnesty International posted online a letter from Manning in which she wrote: \"I am now preparing for my court-martial appeal before the first appeals court. The appeal team, with my attorneys Nancy Hollander and Vince Ward, are hoping to file our brief before the court in the next six months. We have already had success in getting the court to respect my gender identity by using feminine pronouns in the court filings (she, her, etc.).\"[205]\nIn November 2016, Manning made a formal petition to President Obama to reduce her 35-year sentence to the six years of time she had already served.[206] On December 10, 2016, a White House petition to commute her sentence reached the minimum 100,000 signatures required for an official response.[207] Lawyers familiar with clemency applications stated in December 2016 that the pardon was unlikely to happen; the request did not fit into the usual criteria.[208]\n\nCommutation[edit]\nIn January 2017, a Justice Department source said that Manning was on President Obama's short list for a possible commutation.[209] On January 17, 2017, President Obama commuted all but four months of Manning's remaining sentence.[8][210] In a press conference held on January 18, Obama stated that Manning's original 35-year prison sentence was \"very disproportionate relative to what other leakers have received\" and that \"it makes sense to commute\u2014and not pardon\u2014her sentence.\"[210][211] Notwithstanding her commutation, Manning's military appeal will continue, with her attorney saying, \"We fight in her appeal to clear her name.\"[212]\nOn January 26, 2017, in her first column for The Guardian since the commutation, Manning lamented that President Obama's political opponents consistently refused to compromise, resulting in \"very few permanent accomplishments\" during his time in office. As The Guardian summarized it, she saw Obama's legacy as \"a warning against not being bold enough\".[213] In response, President Donald Trump tweeted that Manning was an \"ungrateful traitor\" and should \"never have been released\".[214]\n\nRelease[edit]\nManning was released from Fort Leavenworth's detention center at approximately 2 a.m. Central Time on May 17, 2017.[215][216] Although sentenced during her court-martial to be dishonorably discharged, Manning was reportedly returned to active unpaid \"excess leave\" status while her appeal is pending.[217]\n\nAppeal[edit]\nOn May 31, 2018, the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals upheld Chelsea Manning's 2013 court-martial conviction of violating the Espionage Act. The court rejected Manning's contention that the statute is too vague to provide fair notice of the criminal nature of disclosing classified documents. \"The facts of this case,\" the three-judge panel ruled, \"leave no question as to what constituted national defense information. Appellant's training and experience indicate, without any doubt, she was on notice and understood the nature of the information she was disclosing and how its disclosure could negatively affect national defense.\" The court also rejected Manning's assertion that her actions in disclosing classified information related to national security are protected by the First Amendment. Manning, the court found, \"had no First Amendment right to make the disclosures\u2014doing so not only violated the nondisclosure agreements she signed but also jeopardized national security.\"[218][219]\n\n2019 jailing for contempt[edit]\n Manning (left) in Brooklyn during coronavirus pandemic in April 2020, forty days after her release from jail[220]In February 2019, Manning received a subpoena to testify in a US government case against WikiLeaks and Julian Assange (the existence of which had been accidentally revealed in November 2018), which was proceeding under prosecutors in Virginia.[221] Manning objected to the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings and announced she would refuse to testify,[222] saying \"we've seen this power abused countless times to target political speech. I have nothing to contribute to this case and I resent being forced to endanger myself by participating in this predatory practice.\"[223] Manning also said she had provided all the information she had in 2013 during her court martial and that she stood by her previous answers.[224]\nOn March 8, 2019, Manning was found in contempt of court and jailed in the women's wing of a detention center in Alexandria, Virginia, with the judge conditioning her release on her testifying or the grand jury concluding its work.[225][226][227] Manning was initially held in administrative segregation for 28 days until she was placed in the general population on April 5, 2019.[228] Her supporters described her period in administrative segregation as \"effective solitary confinement\" as it involved \"up to 22 hours each day spent in isolation\".[229]  Officials at the facility said that administrative segregation was used for safety reasons and that prisoners still had access to recreation and social visits during that time.[225]  On April 22, 2019, a federal appeals court upheld the trial court's decision holding Manning in contempt and denied a request by Manning that she be released on bail.[230]\nAfter the grand jury's term expired, Manning was released on May 9, 2019 and served with another subpoena to appear before a new grand jury on May 16.[231]  Manning again refused to testify, stating that she \"believe[d] this grand jury seeks to undermine the integrity of public discourse with the aim of punishing those who expose any serious, ongoing, and systemic abuses of power by this government\".  The court ordered her returned to jail and fined $500 for each day over 30 days and $1,000 for each day over 60 days.[232][233] In June 2019, she challenged the fines because of inability to pay.[234]  On December 30, 2019, United Nations special rapporteur Nils Melzer released a letter dated November 1, 2019 in which he accused the U.S. government of torturing Manning, called for her immediate release, and called for her court fines to be canceled or reimbursed.[235][236][237]\nOn March 11, 2020, Manning attempted suicide two days before she was scheduled to appear before a judge on a motion to terminate sanctions.[238][239]  Alexandria Sheriff Dana Lawhorne reported that Manning was safe and her lawyers said she was recovering in a hospital.[240][238]\nOn March 12, 2020, U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia found that the business of the grand jury had concluded.  Since Manning's testimony was no longer needed, the judge found that detention no longer served any coercive purpose, and ordered her released.[241]  He denied a request by Manning's lawyers to vacate her accrued fines of $256,000, which he ordered due and payable immediately.[242] That same day, a supporter launched an online crowdfunding campaign to defray Manning's fines. Within 48 hours, nearly 7,000 donations ranging from $5 to $10,000 were received, totaling $267,000.[243] A separate crowdfund by the same supporter raised an additional $50,000 to help pay Manning's post-incarceration living expenses.[244]\n\nReaction to disclosures[edit]\n Demonstration in support of Manning, San Francisco, June 2011\nThe publication of the leaked material, particularly the diplomatic cables, attracted in-depth coverage worldwide, with several governments blocking websites that contained embarrassing details. Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, said: \"I can't think of a time when there was ever a story generated by a news organization where the White House, the Kremlin, Ch\u00e1vez, India, China, everyone in the world was talking about these things. ... I've never known a story that created such mayhem that wasn't an event like a war or a terrorist attack.\"[245]\nUnited States Navy Admiral Michael Mullen, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the leaks had placed the lives of American soldiers and Afghan informants in danger.[246] Journalist Glenn Greenwald argued that Manning was the most important whistleblower since Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971.[247] In an impromptu questioning session after a fundraiser, captured on a cell phone video, President Barack Obama said that Manning \"broke the law\", which was later criticized as \"unlawful command influence\" on Manning's upcoming trial.[248][249]\nIn 2011, Manning and WikiLeaks were credited in part,[250][251] along with news reporters and political analysts,[252] as catalysts for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010, when waves of protesters rose up against rulers across the Middle East and North Africa, after the leaked cables exposed government corruption. In 2012, however, James L. Gelvin, an American scholar of Middle Eastern history, wrote: \"After the outbreak [January 2011] of the Egyptian uprising \u2026 journalists decided to abandon another term they had applied to the Tunisian uprising: the first 'WikiLeaks Revolution,' a title they had adopted that overemphasized the role played by the leaked American cables about corruption in provoking the protests.\"[253]\nA Washington Post editorial asked why an apparently unstable Army private had been able to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place.[254] According to her biographer, the American far right saw Manning's sexuality as evidence that gay people were unfit for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.[255]\nA report written by the Department of Defense a year after the breach found that Manning's document leaks had no significant strategic impact on U.S. war efforts. The heavily redacted final report was not published until June 2017, after a Freedom of Information request by investigative reporter Jason Leopold.[256]\n\nAwards and tributes[edit]\nIn 2011, Manning was awarded a \"Whistleblowerpreis\" by the German Section of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms and the Federation of German Scientists.[257] While still in detention in 2011, Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills and Nash released a song, \"Almost Gone (The Ballad of Bradley Manning)\", in reference to her deteriorated mental state.[258] In 2012, she was awarded \"People's Choice Award\" awarded by Global Exchange.[259] In 2013, she was awarded the US Peace Prize by the US Peace Memorial Foundation \"for conspicuous bravery, at the risk of his own freedom, above and beyond the call of duty.\"[260] In the same year, she was awarded the Sean MacBride Peace Prize by the International Peace Bureau.[261] In 2014, she was awarded the Sam Adams Award by Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence.[262][263]\nIcelandic and Swedish Pirate Party MPs nominated Manning and fellow whistleblower Edward Snowden for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize. In 2013, Roots Action launched a petition nominating Manning for the prize that received more than 100,000 supporting signatures.[264]\nIn May 2015, Anything to Say?, an art installation made of mobile bronze statues of Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange, was placed at Berlin's Alexanderplatz for a weekend, as a \"monument for courage\".[265] Germany's Green Party sponsored the sculpture created by Italian sculptor Davide Dormino.[266] Afterwards, the installation was moved and exhibited in different European cities.[267]\nIn 2015, Paper magazine commissioned artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg to create 2D DNA phenotype portraits of Chelsea Manning using DNA collected from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to the artist from the incarcerated soldier.[268] 3D printed versions of the portraits premiered at the World Economic Forum in 2016.[269] In the summer of 2017, Manning (by then released from prison) and Dewey-Hagborg presented their collaboration as part of an exhibition at the Fridman Gallery in New York City.[270][271]\nIn September 2017, Manning accepted the EFF Pioneer Award in recognition of her actions as a whistleblower and for her work as an advocate for government transparency and transgender rights.[272] In November, she was named 2017 Newsmaker of the Year by Out, which noted her \"whistle-in-the-wind tenacity that belies the trauma she's had to contend with\".[273] Later that month, Bitch listed her among the first-ever \"Bitch 50\" impactful creators, artists, and activists in pop culture, recognizing her as \"a leading voice for transgender and healthcare rights\".[274] In December, Foreign Policy honored Manning as one of its forty-eight 2017 Global Thinkers \"for forcing the United States to question who is a traitor and who is a hero\".[275]\nIn October 2020, Manning shared with the German nonprofit investigative journalism organization CORRECT!V and Greece's anonymous Novartis whistleblowers the third annual European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) prize for Journalists, Whistleblowers and Defenders of the Right to Information.[276] The GUE/NGL posted a video of her acceptance from her home in Brooklyn, New York.[277]\n\nGender transition[edit]\n2010[edit]\nIn an article written by Manning, she says her first public appearance as female was in February 2010 while on leave from her military duties; Manning was exhilarated to blend in as a woman.[278]\n\n2013[edit]\nOn August 22, 2013, the day after sentencing, Manning's attorney issued a press release to the Today show announcing that his client was a female, and asked that she be referred to by her new name of Chelsea and feminine pronouns. Manning's statement included the following:\n\nAs I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in this transition. I also request that, starting today, you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun (except in official mail to the confinement facility). I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and having the opportunity to write back.[279]\nThe news media split in its reaction to Manning's request; some organizations used the new name and pronouns, and others continued to use the former ones.[280][281] Advocacy groups such as GLAAD, the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association, and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) encouraged media outlets to refer to Manning by her self-identified name and pronoun.[282][283][284]\n\n2014[edit]\n How Chelsea Manning sees herself by Alicia Neal, in cooperation with Manning herself, commissioned by the Chelsea Manning Support Network, April 23, 2014[285][286]\nIn April 2014, the Kansas District Court granted a petition from Manning for a legal name change.[287] An Army spokesman stated that while the Army would update personnel records to acknowledge the name change, the military would continue to regard Manning as a male.[3] Manning sought hormone therapy and the right to live as a woman while confined, consistent with her gender dysphoria, which had been confirmed by two Army medical specialists. Such treatment is provided in civilian federal prisons when it is found to be medically necessary, but it is not available in military prisons. The Pentagon policy at the time considered transgender individuals ineligible to serve.[288][289]\nIn July, the Federal Bureau of Prisons rejected a request by the Army to transfer Manning from the USDB to a civilian facility for treatment of her gender dysphoria. Instead, the Army kept Manning in military custody and said it would begin rudimentary gender treatment, which could include allowing her to wear female undergarments and possibly receive hormone treatments.[290]\nOn August 12, 2014, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Manning's civilian attorney David Coombs said Manning was not receiving treatment for her gender identity condition as previously approved by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. They notified the USDB, Hagel and other Defense Department officials that a lawsuit would be filed if they did not confirm by September 4 that treatment would be provided.[291] On August 22, Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Alayne Conway told NBC News, \"The Department of Defense has approved a request by Army leadership to provide required medical treatment for an inmate diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\" Although Conway would not discuss \"the medical needs of an individual\", she did say, \"In general terms, the initial stages of treatment for individuals with gender dysphoria include psychotherapy and elements of the 'real life experience' therapy. Treatment for the condition is highly individualized and generally is sequential and graduated.\" The Army declined to say when treatment might begin.[292]\nIn September, Manning filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., against Secretary of Defense Hagel, claiming she had \"been denied access to medically necessary treatment\" for gender disorder. She sued to be allowed to grow her hair longer and use cosmetics, and to receive hormone treatments \"to express her female gender\".[293]\n\n2015[edit]\nOn February 12, 2015, USA Today reported that the commandant of the USDB wrote in a February 5 memo, \"After carefully considering the recommendation that (hormone treatment) is medically appropriate and necessary, and weighing all associated safety and security risks presented, I approve adding (hormone treatment) to Inmate Manning's treatment plan.\" According to USA Today, Manning remained a soldier, and the decision to administer hormone therapy was a first for the Army.[294] Manning was not allowed to grow her hair longer. Her ACLU attorney, Chase Strangio, said that the delay in approving her hormone treatment \"came with a significant cost to Chelsea and her mental health\".[295]\nOn March 5, in response to Manning's request for an order compelling the military to use pronouns that conform to her chosen gender identity, the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals ruled, \"Reference to appellant in all future formal papers filed before this court and all future orders and decisions issued by this court shall either be neutral, e.g., Private First Class Manning or appellant, or employ a feminine pronoun.\"[296]\nOn March 14, the digital library host Cryptome posted an unsigned public copy of a court document, filed March 10, wherein the parties to Manning's September 2014 lawsuit against Secretary of Defense Hagel agreed to stay proceedings for seven months, after which time they would address how the litigation should proceed in light of Manning's status at that time. The document revealed that the Army was then providing Manning with weekly psychotherapy, including psychotherapy specific to gender dysphoria; cross-sex hormone therapy; female undergarments; the ability to wear prescribed cosmetics in her daily life at the USDB; and speech therapy.[297]\nIn April 2015, Amnesty International posted online a letter from Manning in which she disclosed,\n\nI finally began my prescribed regime of hormones to continue my overdue gender transition in February. It's been such an amazing relief for my body and brain to finally come into alignment with each other. My stress and anxiety levels have tapered off quite considerably. Overall, things are beginning to move along nicely.[205]\n2016[edit]\nOn September 13, 2016, the ACLU announced that the army would be granting Manning's request for gender transition surgery, a first for a transgender inmate.[298] In December, Manning's attorneys reported that her military doctor refused Manning's request to change the gender on her military records to female.[299]\n\n2017[edit]\nIn January 2017, Manning wrote to The New York Times that although months had passed, she had still not seen a surgeon.[300] At the time of Manning's release from prison in May 2017, her attorney stressed that she would be pursuing her own medical care and \"building her life on her own terms, separate from the military\".[301] Manning subsequently stated via her verified Twitter account that her healthcare from the military had stopped on May 16, 2017,[302] and that she had secured a private health plan.[303] She said her gender transition while in prison had cost \"only $600 over 2 years\",[304] explaining that the Department of Defense \"got meds at a markdown\".[305] Although the Army had agreed in September 2016 to allow her to have gender transition surgery, the operation was not performed before her release.[306]\nOn May 22, 2017, Manning's 2014 lawsuit seeking a federal court to order the Defense Department to provide hormone therapy and other treatment for her gender identity condition was dismissed because, her ACLU attorney explained, \"she is free\".[307]\n\n2018[edit]\nOn October 20, 2018, Manning tweeted a photograph of herself in a hospital bed reportedly recovering from gender reassignment surgery.[308] \"After almost a decade of fighting,\" she wrote, \"thru prison, the courts, a hunger strike, and thru the insurance company\u2014I finally got surgery this week.\"[309] In March 2019, in the context of medical care provided during her re-incarceration, the news media continued to report that she had undergone gender reassignment surgery.[310][311] In a declaration to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia filed on May 6, 2019, Manning formally  attested that she underwent gender con\ufb01rmation surgery in October 2018.[312]\n\nPrison life[edit]\nIn March 2015, Bloomberg News reported that Manning could be visited by only those she had named before her imprisonment, and not by journalists. She could not be photographed or give interviews on camera. Manning was not allowed to browse the web, but could consult print news and have access to new gender theory texts.[313]\nIn April 2015, Amnesty International posted online a letter from Manning in which she described her daily life. \"My days here are busy and very routine,\" she wrote. \"I am taking college correspondence courses for a bachelor's degree. I also work out a lot to stay fit, and read newspapers, magazines and books to keep up-to-date on current events around the world and learn new things.\"[205]\nAlso that month, Cosmopolitan published the first interview with Manning in prison, conducted by mail. Cosmo reported that Manning was optimistic about recent progress but said that not being allowed to grow her hair long was \"painful and awkward \u2026 I am torn up. I get through each day okay, but at night, when I'm alone in my room, I finally burn out and crash.\" Manning said it was \"very much a relief\" to announce that she is a woman and did not fear the public response. \"Honestly, I'm not terribly worried about what people out there might think of me. I just try to be myself.\" According to Cosmo, Manning had her own cell with \"two tall vertical windows that face the sun\", and could see \"trees and hills and blue sky and all the things beyond the buildings and razor wire\". Manning denied being harassed by other inmates and claimed some had become confidantes.[314]\n\nWriting[edit]\nIn February 2015, Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief of Guardian US, announced that Manning had joined The Guardian as a contributing opinion writer on war, gender, and freedom of information.[315] In 2014, The Guardian had published two op-eds by Manning: \"How to make Isis fall on its own sword\" (September 16)[316] and, \"I am a transgender woman and the government is denying my civil rights\" (December 8).[317] Manning's debut under the new arrangement, \"The CIA's torturers and the leaders who approved their actions must face the law,\" appeared on March 9, 2015.[318]\nIn April 2015, Manning began communicating via Twitter, under the handle @xychelsea,[319] by using a voice phone to dictate to intermediaries, who tweeted on her behalf.[320]\n\nSuicide attempts[edit]\nOn July 5, 2016, Manning was taken to a hospital after what media sources characterized as a suicide attempt.[321] The following week, Manning confirmed through an attorney statement that she had attempted to end her own life.[322][323] On July 28, 2016, the ACLU announced that Manning was under investigation and facing several possible charges related to her suicide attempt.[324] She was not allowed to have legal representation at the disciplinary hearing for these charges.[325] At the hearing, held on September 22, she was sentenced to 14 days in solitary confinement, with seven of those days suspended indefinitely.[326] Manning emerged from solitary confinement on October 12, after serving seven days; she said that she was not given the opportunity to appeal the ruling before being placed in solitary.[327]\nIn an article following her recovery, entitled \"Moving On\", Chelsea reflected on her change in identity, wishing people to see her no longer as \"Chelsea Manning, formerly Bradley Manning, a US Army Soldier... convicted...\", but as a person. She used a selfie from 2008 to accompany the article.[328]\nIn November 2016, Manning disclosed that she made a second suicide attempt on October 4, 2016, on the first night of her solitary confinement.[329]\n\nHunger strike[edit]\nOn September 9, 2016, Manning began a hunger strike to protest what she described as her being bullied by prison authorities and the U.S. government.[330] On September 13, the ACLU announced that Manning had ended the five-day hunger strike after the Army agreed to provide gender transition surgery.[298] The operation, however, was not performed before her release from prison in May 2017.[306]\n\nPost-prison life[edit]\n Chelsea Manning interviewed at Wired Next Festival 2018 in Milan\nIn a June 9, 2017, appearance on Good Morning America, her first interview following her release, Manning said she \"accepted responsibility\" for her actions, and thanked former President Obama for giving her \"another chance\".[331] She now earns a living through speaking engagements.[23]\n\nHarvard visiting fellowship and rescindment[edit]\nOn September 13, 2017, Chelsea Manning was named a visiting fellow at Harvard University. Bill Delahunt, acting director of the Harvard Institute of Politics, said: \"Broadening the range and depth of opportunity for students to hear from and engage with experts, leaders and policy-shapers is a cornerstone of the Institute of Politics. We welcome the breadth of thought-provoking viewpoints on race, gender, politics and the media.\"[332] Harvard said Manning would visit for a limited number of events meant to spark campus discussion,[333] and in particular would engage students in discourse on \"issues of LGBTQ identity in the military\".[334] According to online newspaper PinkNews, this marked \"the only LGBT-related fellowship in Harvard history\".[335]\nThe next day Michael Morell, former deputy director and twice acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), resigned as a nonresident senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. \"Unfortunately,\" Morell wrote, \"I cannot be part of an organization\u2014The Kennedy School\u2014that honors a convicted felon and leaker of classified information ... the Kennedy School's decision will assist Ms. Manning in her long-standing effort to legitimize the criminal path that she took to prominence, an attempt that may encourage others to leak classified information as well.\"[336] Later that day, CIA director Mike Pompeo advised the university that he supported Morell's decision, and withdrew from his scheduled public appearance that evening at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.[337] Calling Manning an \"American traitor\",[338] Pompeo wrote: \"While I have served my country as a soldier in the United States Army and will continue to defend Ms. Manning's right to offer a defense of why she chose this path, I believe it is shameful for Harvard to place its stamp of approval upon her treasonous actions.\"[337]\nOn September 15, 2017, Douglas Elmendorf, dean of the Kennedy School, announced that Chelsea Manning had been invited to spend only a single day at the school and that her title of visiting fellow did not convey a special honor. \"We did not intend to honor her in any way,\" Elmendorf wrote, \"or to endorse any of her words or deeds ... However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. ... Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow\u2014and the perceived honor that it implies to some people\u2014while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation.\"[339] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title \"visiting fellow\". The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.[340]\nOn September 17, 2017, during a public appearance at The Nantucket Project in Massachusetts, Manning said: \"I'm not ashamed of being disinvited. I view that just as much of an honored distinction as the fellowship itself.\"[341] She added, \"This is a military intelligence and it is a police state in which we can no longer engage in actual political discourse in our institutions.\"[342]\n\nDenied entry to Canada[edit]\nOn September 22, 2017, Manning was denied entry to Canada from the United States because of her criminal record.[343] According to a letter from Canadian immigration officials, posted online by Manning,[344] she is inadmissible due to being convicted of offenses equivalent to treason in Canada.[343] Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency on the evening of September 21 and detained overnight. She said she would retain a Canadian lawyer to challenge the inadmissibility finding before a Canadian tribunal.[345]\n\nRestriction on speech[edit]\nDuring an October 8, 2017, appearance at The New Yorker Festival, Manning said she is legally unable to speak about certain details concerning her leaks,[346] confirming a July 2017 post from her verified Twitter account saying \"technically, i cant [sic] read, comment on, discuss, or even look at any leaked material, even if it was after 2010\".[347]\n\nU.S. Senate candidacy[edit]\nOn January 11, 2018, Manning filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for the U.S. Senate in Maryland.[24] On January 18, Manning filed with the Maryland State Board of Elections to challenge the state's senior senator, two-term incumbent Ben Cardin, as a Democrat in the June 26, 2018, primary election.[348]\nOn February 1, The Washington Post raised questions about Manning's eligibility to run. \"While her case is on appeal,\" reported The Post, \"she is on a technical form of unpaid active duty, putting her political campaign at odds with Department of Defense regulations that prohibit military personnel from seeking public office.\" Military law expert Eugene R. Fidell of Yale Law School considered it unlikely the Army would take action against her, saying, \"Services don't like to create martyrs.\"[349] On February 2, Manning commented: \"This is an issue that's cropped up mostly from the conservative blogosphere, and the campaign and we don't believe this is an issue at all. \u2026 I've been issued a dishonorable discharge, and I'm not sure where the issue lies in this case.\" She also confirmed that she was still appealing her court-martial sentence.[350]\nIn mid-February, she said she had no plans to run television ads, explaining, \"I can't stand watching campaign ads. We don't need to go to these old-media methods.\" Commenting on her opponent, 74-year-old incumbent Ben Cardin, she stated, \"He's old hat. He's kept this establishment going.\"[23]\nIn May, Manning told the Associated Press that she did not, in fact, consider herself a Democrat, but wanted to shake up establishment Democrats who were \"caving in\" to President Trump. The AP noted that, despite having raised $72,000 during the first quarter (compared to the incumbent's $336,000), \"The candidate has barely made an effort at tapping sources of grassroots enthusiasm outside of activism circles. And it's easy to find progressive Democrats who feel her candidacy is just a vehicle to boost her profile.\" Manning said she would not run as an independent should her primary bid fail.[351]\nOn June 26, 2018, Manning finished second among eight Democrats vying for their party's U.S. Senate nomination in Maryland's primary election. Manning received 5.7% of the votes. Incumbent Ben Cardin won renomination with 80.5% of the votes cast.[25]\nShortly after the polls closed, Manning posted a statement on her campaign website. \"Over the past several months,\" she wrote, \"it has become clear that my experiences have taken an enormous toll on my physical and emotional health. I stepped back from campaigning to prioritize my own well-being.\" She thanked \"the more than one thousand individual donors who generously contributed to our campaign,\" and \"our team of hundreds of volunteers.\" But, she added, \"after spending hours and hours knocking on doors and making phone calls, I'm convinced that the change people truly need goes beyond what our corrupt two-party system is willing to offer.\"[352]\n\nContacts with far-right social media figures[edit]\n Chelsea Manning outside \"A Night for Freedom\" in New York City 2018\nOn January 20, 2018, Manning attended \"A Night for Freedom\" hosted by far-right social media personality Mike Cernovich at the nightclub FREQ in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan. The party was billed, in Cernovich's words, as a \"gathering of patriots and political dissidents who are bored with mainstream political events\", and included right-wing figures such as Gavin McInnes, James O'Keefe, Lucian Wintrich,[353] and Jack Posobiec.[354] According to The Washington Post, Manning's attendance infuriated the far-left. \"What followed,\" The Post reported, \"was an overheated Internet tug-of-war between opposite sides of the political spectrum, each accusing the other of co-opting Manning, while her intentions were relentlessly picked apart.\"[353] Manning afterward stated that she was acting as a double agent, infiltrating the alt-right to gather information and insight about alt-right rally plans.[355]\nAfter first getting in touch with Cassandra Fairbanks\u2014an admirer and writer for the right-wing website The Gateway Pundit\u2014in September 2017, Manning tapped into Fairbanks's close ties to D.C. area alt-right media influencers. In December 2017, Manning participated with Fairbanks, Posobiec, Wintrich, and others in Escape the Room DC, and spent an evening drinking and playing Cards Against Humanity at Wintrich's apartment with him, Fairbanks, and others. \"I\u00a0viewed this as an opportunity to use the celebrity and fame I've gotten since getting out of prison,\" Manning told The Daily Beast in January 2018, \"to gather information and to ultimately find ways in which we who are against the alt-right can undermine the alt-right.\" She added, \"The thing in all this that I've learned is that they don't actually believe the things that they say. I just feel they're opportunists and that they exploit their Twitter followers' fears.\" Manning acknowledged, however, that these incidents left many of her own supporters feeling betrayed. \"People have every right to be confused and hurt by this,\" she said. \"Regardless of good intentions, I\u00a0leveraged my privilege to gain access to spaces others couldn't dream of entering safely. I never meant to hurt my supporters. No amount of information on the alt-right is worth losing the trust of my supporters.\"[356]\n\nTour of Australia and New Zealand[edit]\nIn August 2018, the Government of Australia refused to issue Manning a visa to enter the country, where she was scheduled to make a series of public appearances. The company arranging Manning's speaking tour said it would appeal the decision,[357] taken under s501(1) of the Migration Act, which authorizes a minister to refuse a visa on character grounds.[358] The Department of Home Affairs specified that Manning did not pass the character test because of her \"substantial criminal record\".[359] On September 2, Manning spoke as scheduled at the Sydney Opera House except that she appeared onscreen live via satellite from Los Angeles.[360]\nOn August 31, Immigration New Zealand granted Manning special direction to apply for a work visa to enter New Zealand, stating there was \"no reason to believe Ms Manning would not comply with the terms and conditions of any visa issued\". Due to her previous convictions for espionage and other offenses, Manning is subject to character provisions of the Immigration Act. Manning had plans to tour Auckland and Wellington on September 8 and 9.[361][362][363] Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern defended the New Zealand Government's decision to allow Manning entry, stating that \"we are a nation that allows free speech\".[364] By contrast, the center-right National Party had called for Manning to be banned from entering New Zealand on national security grounds due to her espionage and computer fraud convictions.[365][366]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nInformation security\nInformation sensitivity\nLGBT people in prison\nList of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States\nMcCarran Internal Security Act of 1950\nReception of WikiLeaks\nThe Source (oratorio)\n\nBiography portalLGBT portalTransgender portal\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ WikiLeaks tweeted on January 8, 2010, that they had obtained \"encrypted videos of US bomb strikes on civilians\", and linked to a story about the airstrike; see \"Have encrypted videos ...\", Twitter, January 8, 2010 (archived from the original, May 8, 2012).

McBeth (August 20, 1934 \u2013 September 24, 2014) was an American transgender teacher from Tuckerton, New Jersey.[1] She was born William B. McBeth and as part of her transition underwent sex reassignment surgery in 2005. Her actions were hailed as a model of tolerance and acceptance of transgender Americans.[2][3] She had three grown children from a previous marriage of 33 years.[4] She was a retired medical sales and marketing executive. She was an active surfer, sailor, skier and duck hunter. As a soldier, she served in the U.S. Army as a Senior Medical Corpsman with a tour duty in Alaska. She said that she had always perceived herself as female and identified with other women.[4] She said that for many years, she was afraid to address her gender identity and felt that her first priority was keeping her family together for the sake of her children.[citation needed].\nMcBeth worked as a substitute teacher at Little Egg Harbor Township School District, Pinelands Regional School District and Eagleswood Elementary School District for five years prior to her transition and returned after completing surgery to resume her teaching career.[5] Some in the community did not think she should have been allowed to return to teaching. One parent took out a full-page advertisement in a local newspaper alerting parents to what had happened. Parents expressed fear that some of her students would not understand transgender identity.[6] After listening to parents and citizens providing public input, the school district board decided to uphold their previous 4 to 1 vote for her reinstatement.[7] This decision was hailed and criticized by politicians, journalists, and activists around the world. While she continued working as a substitute in Eagleswood School District she reapplied and was put on the substitute teachers list in the Pinelands Regional School in Little Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, in fall 2006. The School Board appointed her to this position after a meeting at which they heard no negative comments; the vote to accept her was unanimous, with one member abstaining.[8]\nIn 2009, McBeth retired from substituting, claiming that she had received fewer substituting assignments, which she attributed to being a trans woman. She was involved in local theater productions, church choir, and volunteering to re-establish clam colonies in Barnegat Bay.[9]\nMcBeth died on September 24, 2014, at the age of 80.[10]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Community Divided Over Transgender Teacher\".

When she is sworn in, she will become the first transgender state senator in the country, making her the highest-ranking transgender official in United States history.[4][5][6]\nMcBride is largely credited with the passage of legislation in Delaware banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity in employment, housing, insurance, and public accommodations.[7] In July 2016, she was a speaker at the Democratic National Convention, becoming the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention in American history.[8][9][10][11]\nIn 2018, McBride released the book Tomorrow Will Be Different: Love, Loss, and the Fight for Trans Equality.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Activism\n2.2 Politics\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 Electoral history\n5 References\n6 Further reading\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nSarah McBride was born in Wilmington, Delaware, to David and Sally McBride.[12] Prior to coming out, McBride was a campaign staffer in Delaware, working on several campaigns including Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden's 2010 campaign and Governor Jack Markell's 2008 campaign. In 2011, McBride was elected student body president at American University. During her last week as student body president, McBride gained international attention when she came out as a transgender woman in her college's student newspaper, The Eagle.[13]\nMcBride's coming out was featured on NPR, The Huffington Post, and by Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation.[14][15][16]\nAfter coming out, McBride received a call from Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, saying, \"Sarah, I just wanted you to know, I'm so proud of you. I love you, and you're still a part of the Biden family.\" Vice President Joe Biden expressed similar sentiments, sharing that he was proud of her and happy for her. In 2012, McBride interned at The White House, becoming the first openly transgender woman to work there in any capacity. McBride worked in the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, where she worked on LGBT issues.[17][18] In a speech in May 2015, Second Lady Jill Biden told Sarah's story. She added, \"we believe young people should be valued for who they are, no matter what they look like, where they're from, the gender with which they identify, or who they love.\"[19]\n\nCareer[edit]\nActivism[edit]\n McBride in 2018\nIn January 2013, McBride joined the board of directors of Equality Delaware and quickly became the state's leading advocate for legal protections and hate crimes legislation for transgender Delawareans. McBride and her family led the lobbying effort for legislation protecting Delawareans from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression in employment, housing, insurance, and public accommodations.[20][21] In addition to serving as the primary spokesperson for the legislation, McBride's close relationship with Governor Jack Markell and Attorney General Beau Biden was credited with getting both elected officials vocally behind the bill. The legislation passed the state senate by a margin of one vote and the state house by a vote of 24-17. The amended bill was then re-passed by the state senate and immediately signed into law by Governor Jack Markell in June 2013.[22]\nUpon signing the legislation, Markell stated, \"I especially want to thank my friend Sarah McBride, an intelligent and talented Delawarean who happens to be transgender. She courageously stood before the General Assembly to describe her personal struggles with gender identity and communicate her desire to return home after her college graduation without fear. Her tireless advocacy for passage of this legislation has made a real difference for all transgender people in Delaware.\"[23]\nAfter the passage of Delaware's gender identity protections and hate crimes legislation, McBride worked on the LGBT Progress team at the Center for American Progress.[24] McBride has spoken at a number of colleges and LGBT events, including the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner,[18] the Human Rights Campaign Los Angeles Dinner,[25] the Victory Fund National Brunch,[26] the University of Pennsylvania,[27] and Gettysburg College.[28] McBride was ranked the Most Valuable Progressive in Delaware by DelawareLiberal.net[29] listed in the 2014 list of the Trans 100,[30] and named one of the fifty upcoming millennials poised to make a difference in the coming years by MIC.com.[31] A 2015 article in the NewStatesman on transgender representation in elective office predicted McBride would be the first transgender American elected to high public office.[32] McBride was a panelist at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's \"GLOBE Pride 2016\" on youth and workplace bullying. McBride has been featured in The New York Times, The Huffington Post, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Al Jazeera, PBS NewsHour, Teen Vogue, North Carolina Public Radio, The New Yorker, MSNBC, ThinkProgress, Buzzfeed, and NPR.\nIn April 2016, McBride delivered a TED Talk titled, \"Gender assigned to us at birth should not dictate who we are.\"[33] She also served on the steering committee of Trans United for Hillary, an effort to educate and mobilize transgender people and their allies in support of Hillary Clinton.[34]\nOn July 28, 2016, McBride became the first openly transgender person to speak at a national party convention when she spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In her speech, which lasted less than four minutes, McBride paid tribute to her late husband Andrew Cray and his commitment to LGBT rights.[35]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nOn July 9, 2019, McBride formally announced her candidacy for the Delaware Senate.[36] Sarah stated that her focus will be health care and paid family and medical leave.[37]\nMcBride is set to be sworn in as a member of the Delaware Senate in January 2021. She is set to be the first transgender state senator in United States history. She will replace Democrat Harris McDowell III, who plans to retire at the end of his term.[38]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn August 2014, McBride married Andrew Cray after he received a terminal cancer diagnosis. Episcopal Bishop Gene Robinson presided at their ceremony. Four days after their wedding, Cray died from cancer.[39]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\n\n2020 Delaware Senate election, District 1[40]\n\n\nPrimary election\n\n\nParty\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic \n\nSarah McBride \n\n7,902 \n\n91.3 \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nJoseph McCole\n\n752\n\n8.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n8,654 \n\n100 \n\n\nGeneral election\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\nSarah McBride\n\n16,861\n\n73.3\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\nSteve Washington\n\n6,143\n\n26.7\n\n\nTotal votes\n\n23,004 \n\n100 \n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Wilmington native to address DNC\".

She is also adjunct professor of Philosophy and Classics there, and for five years was a visiting Professor of philosophy at Erasmus University, Rotterdam. Since October 2007 she has received six honorary doctorates.[1] In 2013, she received the Julian L. Simon Memorial Award from the Competitive Enterprise Institute for her work examining factors in history that led to advancement in human achievement and prosperity.[2]  Her main research interests include the origins of the modern world, the misuse of statistical significance in economics and other sciences, and the study of capitalism, among many others.\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Bourgeois era\n3 Personal life\n4 Publications\n5 Articles\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\n McCloskey speaking in 2015 in Washington, D.C.\nMcCloskey earned her undergraduate and graduate degrees in Economics at Harvard University. Her dissertation, supervised by Alexander Gerschenkron,[3] on British iron and steel won in 1973 the David A. Wells Prize.[4]\nIn 1968, McCloskey became an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago, where she stayed for 12 years, gaining tenure as an associate professor in economics in 1975, and an associate professorship in history in 1979.  Her work at Chicago, under her birth name Donald McCloskey, is marked by her contribution to the cliometric revolution in economic history, and teaching generations of leading economists Chicago Price Theory, a course which culminated in her book The Applied Theory of Price.[5]  In 1979, at the suggestion of Wayne Booth in English at Chicago, she turned to the study of rhetoric in economics.  Later at the University of Iowa, McCloskey, the John Murray Professor of Economics and of History (1980\u20131999), published The Rhetoric of Economics (1985) and co-founded with John S. Nelson, Allan Megill, and others an institution and graduate program, the Project on Rhetoric of Inquiry.[6] McCloskey has authored 16 books and nearly 400 articles in her many fields.[7]\nHer major contributions have been to the economic history of Britain (19th-century trade, modern history, and medieval agriculture), the quantification of historical inquiry (Cliometrics), the rhetoric of economics, the rhetoric of the human sciences, economic methodology, virtue ethics, feminist economics, heterodox economics, the role of mathematics in economic analysis, and the use (and misuse) of significance testing in economics, and, in her trilogy \"The Bourgeois Era\",[8] and the origins of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nBourgeois era[edit]\nHer book The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce[9] was the first of a planned series of books about the world since the Industrial Revolution\u2014the Bourgeois Era\u2014and was published in 2006. McCloskey argued that the bourgeoisie, contrary to its self-advertised faith in prudence only, believes in all seven virtues.\nThe second, Bourgeois Dignity: Why Economics Can't Explain the Modern World, was published in 2010, and argued that the unprecedented increase in human welfare of the 19th and 20th centuries, from $3 per capita per day to over $100 per day, issued not from capitalist accumulation but from innovation.\nThe third, Bourgeois Equality: How Ideas, Not Capital or Institutions, Enriched the World, appeared in 2016.[8] McCloskey expanded her argument, coining the term \"Great Enrichment\" to describe the unprecedented gains in human welfare of the 19th and 20th centuries. She reiterated her argument that the enrichment came from innovation and not from accumulation as argued by many including Thomas Piketty.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMcCloskey is the eldest child of Robert McCloskey, a professor of government at Harvard University, and the former Helen Stueland, a poet. McCloskey was born Donald McCloskey and lived as a man until the age of 53. Married for thirty years, and the parent of two children, she made the decision to transition from male to female in 1995, writing about her experience in a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, Crossing: A Memoir (1999, University of Chicago Press).[10] It is an account of her growing recognition of her female identity, and her transition\u2014both surgical and social\u2014into a woman (including her reluctant divorce from her wife). The book describes how in her teenage years, McCloskey would commit gender burglaries of neighbors' homes, dressing up in the crinoline dresses favored by young women of that era, in addition to \"shoes, garter belts and all the equipment of a 1950s girl\". The memoir then goes on to describe her new life, following sex-reassignment surgery, in her career as a female academic economist and scholar of femininity.\nMcCloskey has advocated on behalf of the rights of persons and organizations in the LGBT community.[11] She was a vocal critic of J. Michael Bailey's 2003 book The Man Who Would Be Queen, which popularized the theory of autogynephilia as a motivation for sex reassignment, by the sexologist Ray Blanchard.[12]\nMcCloskey has described herself as a \"literary, quantitative, postmodern, free-market, progressive Episcopalian, Midwestern woman from Boston who was once a man. Not 'conservative'! I'm a Christian libertarian.\"[13]\nIn 2008, McCloskey was awarded an honorary doctorate by NUI Galway.\n\nPublications[edit]\nWhy liberalism works: how true liberal values produce a freer, more equal, prosperous world for all (2019), Yale University Press.

McDonald \"took a pair of scissors out of her purse and turned around to face [him]; he was stabbed in the chest and died from the wound.\"[10] McDonald said she saw how her case was progressing so took the plea bargain rather than face trial and risk a possible 20-year term.[11](p6) According to the Bay Area Reporter her conviction \"sparked outrage, and was viewed by many as an act of transphobia and racism against a woman who defended herself.\"[12] Although a woman, McDonald was housed in two men's prisons.[13] An online petition \"led to the state department of corrections administering the full regimen of hormones she needed.\"[13]\nHer story got international attention including in May 2013 when an Ebony.com article about the case won the GLAAD Media Award for \"Outstanding Digital Journalism Article\". She also received support from transgender activist and actress Laverne Cox, star of Orange Is the New Black, which includes story lines about trans women of color and hate crimes.[3][14] Cox says McDonald is the image she has of her OITNB character, Sophia Burset, and that she plays Burset as an homage to McDonald.[15] Cox also identifies with her experiences, \"So many times I've ... been harassed, any of them could have escalated ... I very easily could be CeCe.\"[15]\nMcDonald was released in January 2014 after serving 19 months. She was profiled in Rolling Stone among other publications and included as part of Advocate's annual \"40 Under 40\" list.[16][17] FREE CeCe, a documentary about McDonald's experiences told through interviews by Laverne Cox, started production in December 2013.[18] The film centers on the attack on McDonald and her friends including the stabbing, her imprisonment, and violence experienced by trans women of color.[19] In August 2014 she was awarded the Bayard Rustin Civil Rights Award by the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club.[12]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Assault\n\n2.1 Background\n2.2 Assault and attacks (June 2011)\n2.3 Pretrial period\n2.4 Media and public attention during pre-trial\n2.5 Plea bargain (May 2012)\n2.6 Imprisonment\n2.7 Flaherty assault case\n2.8 Release (January 2014)\n\n\n3 Post-incarceration\n4 FREE CeCe!\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMcDonald, who was born in 1989[2] and is originally from South Chicago,[11](p6) studied fashion at Minneapolis Community and Technical College.[11](p1)\n\nAssault[edit]\nBackground[edit]\nAt around 11:30pm on June 5, 2011,[11](pp1\u20132) McDonald, her roommate Latavia Taylor, and their friends Larry Tyaries Thomas, Zavawn Smith, and Roneal Harris, all of whom are African-American,[20](p1) walked the half-mile from McDonald and Taylor's apartment in Minneapolis to a Cub Foods to buy groceries. On the way, a police officer briefly stopped and questioned the group without provocation; he then followed them for a short time and departed.[11](pp1\u20132)\n\nAssault and attacks (June 2011)[edit]\nMcDonald said she and her friends were confronted outside the Schooner Tavern by Dean Schmitz and others.[4] According to the charges against McDonald, this occurred shortly after midnight.[21] Schmitz, his girlfriend Jenny Thoreson, and his ex-girlfriend Molly Flaherty had stepped out of the bar for a cigarette.[11](p2) McDonald said they shouted racist and transphobic slurs,[4] while Thoreson, in interviews with police, characterized the remarks as derogatory and sarcastic. Thomas recalled Schmitz, Thoreson, and Flaherty saying \"oh you faggots, you nigger lovers, and whoop-de-woo, you ain't nothing but a bunch of nigger babies,\" and that in response he went over to talk to Schmitz. According to Thomas, Schmitz then walked off and \"started talking this stuff, like, 'Oh, look at the tranny over there, look at that tranny.'\"[11](p2) McDonald said in a letter from Hennepin County jail that Schmitz called everyone in McDonald's group the n-word.[21]\nMcDonald testified that she and her friends tried to walk away,[22] but that Flaherty started a fight[23] by smashing a glass of alcohol against her face, cutting her[22] and requiring 11 stitches.[24] McDonald was asked in court whether Flaherty then said \"I can take on all of you bitches\", to which she replied in the affirmative;[2] Thoreson recalled that at this point Flaherty threw the first punch.[11](p2) According to McDonald's testimony, at one point Schmitz said \"look at that boy dressed like a girl and tucking her dick in\".[2] David Crandell, Flaherty's boyfriend, then stepped out of the bar to find multiple members of McDonald's group attacking Flaherty, and tried to pull them away from her.[11](p2)\nGary Gilbert, a security worker at the Schooner Tavern, recalled seeing Schmitz pull McDonald away from Flaherty, and that Schmitz and McDonald then moved into the street.[11](p2) McDonald's defense characterized this move as McDonald having \"attempted to leave the scene, attempted to get out of harm's way\", and added that she was followed by Schmitz.[2] Gilbert recalled that McDonald appeared to be holding a blade, while Schmitz had his fists clenched and said to McDonald \"you gonna stab me, you bitch?\" Schmitz then hunched over, put his hand to his shirt and said \"you stabbed me,\" to which McDonald replied, according to a witness, \"Yes I did.\"[11](p2)[22] Schmitz was stabbed in the chest with a pair of scissors.[22] McDonald told police that Schmitz charged at her, running into scissors she was holding.[21]\nAfter those present saw Schmitz bleeding, the fighting stopped; McDonald and Thomas ran towards Cub Foods while some of their friends boarded a Metro Transit bus.[11](p2) Schmitz's wound was more than three inches deep and pierced his heart in the right ventricle. Anthony Stoneburg, who was in the neighborhood visiting his aunt, tried to plug the wound, but Schmitz died in the ambulance. In the parking lot of the grocery store, McDonald saw the police car searching for her and flagged the officers down.[11](p1) She was arrested and confessed to the stabbing, but in her letter from Hennepin County jail wrote that confessing was \"a big mistake [for] trying to cover up for one of my friends who actually did it. I didn't know exactly who, but I knew someone was defending me.\"[21] Larry Thomas and Zavawn Smith also said that another friend, who they saw running away from the scene at the time, had admitted stabbing Schmitz.[25]\n\nPretrial period[edit]\nIn the days following the stabbing, the office of Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman reviewed evidence including a taped confession from McDonald before charging her with two counts of second-degree murder.[11](pp1, 3) McDonald's case was picked up by Hersch Izek of the Legal Rights Center, a nonprofit organization offering legal representation and help for its clients. Izek did not dispute that McDonald stabbed Schmitz in the heart or that the wound was responsible for Schmitz's death; however he argued that McDonald acted in self-defense and was not to blame for Schmitz's death: \"she stabbed him, but her actions were reasonable when confronted with the reasonable possibility of bodily harm or death to herself. That's what the jury instruction calls for in this kind of case.\" Izek cited the fact that McDonald was bleeding profusely from her facial wound as a reason for her to believe she was in danger.[11](p3) Freeman argued there was no evidence that Schmitz posed a threat to McDonald's life and that McDonald had failed to exercise her duty to retreat, saying \"the evidence here does not reflect self-defense. She stepped forward to thrust a weapon into a person that had not assaulted her. That, to me, just doesn't fit.\" Freeman also said \"there is no evidence that I'm aware of that [Schmitz] had any weapon in his hand, or that he had done anything to McDonald, other than to be part of this group, where there were shouts from virtually everyone around.\" Freeman also alleged that McDonald's story changed between the incident and her trial: though on the night of June 5 she confessed to stabbing Schmitz, she later claimed someone else had stabbed him.[11](p4)\nThe defense also intended to bring before the jury details about Schmitz, including that he had faced more than two dozen criminal cases since turning 18; his past convictions for fifth-degree assault and domestic assault; that methamphetamine and benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite), which when combined can lead to unpredictable and unwarranted violence, were found in his system; and that he had a tattoo of a swastika on his chest.[11](p3) Schmitz's brother said Schmitz was not a racist, but that he had become a part of a group of white supremacists while in prison when he was younger. Freeman dismissed the tattoo as irrelevant, saying McDonald \"couldn't see it, nor could anyone else ... It adds a little bit of sensationalism to the case, obviously.\"[11](p4)\nOn the first day of pretrial hearings, the prosecution disputed the admittance of Schmitz's tattoo, arguing it was not relevant and was unfairly prejudicial.[11](p4) Judge Daniel Moreno ruled that Schmitz's tattoo and his three previous convictions for assault were not admissible as evidence of his alleged violent disposition, that McDonald's supporters could not wear \"Free CeCe\" T-shirts in court,[23] and that the defense's toxicology expert could testify to the effects of methamphetamine and benzoylecgonine in general but not their effects on Schmitz on the night in question. Moreno also prevented experts from testifying about the atmosphere of transphobia and how it might have made McDonald fear for her life.[26] Moreno also permitted the admittance of McDonald's prior statements on blogs and Facebook and a motion to impeach McDonald's testimony due to her previous conviction for writing a bad check.[11](p5)\n\nMedia and public attention during pre-trial[edit]\nIn the aftermath of the stabbing, Schmitz's family spoke to FOX 9 News. Schmitz's son, Jeremy Williams, said his father \"always used to go out of his way to help people... He would give the shirt off his back to help people. He was, overall, a great person.\"[27] In her letter from Hennepin County jail, McDonald said \"none of this mess wouldn't be happening if it weren't for the victim and his group being rude and disrespectful to people they never knew.\"[21]\nIn April 2012, author Kate Bornstein spoke about McDonald on MSNBC cable television program Melissa Harris-Perry, comparing McDonald's situation with George Zimmerman's in the aftermath of the shooting of Trayvon Martin regarding self-defense issues and how the case is viewed through the media focus.[20](p2) The case also attracted national attention from LGBT activists including author Leslie Feinberg, who wrote that \"the right of self-defense against all forms of oppressions\u2014the spirit of Stonewall\u2014is at the heart of the demand to free [McDonald]\".[4] Cam Gordon, a member of the Minneapolis City Council, announced his support for McDonald and called the incident \"another example [of] transgender women of color being targeted for hate- and bias-related violence\",[11](p1) and Susan Allen, a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, called on Freeman to consider the \"extenuating circumstances\" of McDonald's case.[20](p2) In May 2013, an article by Marc Lamont Hill for Ebony.com entitled \"Why Aren't We Fighting for CeCe McDonald?\" won the GLAAD Media Award for \"Outstanding Digital Journalism Article\".[14] McDonald also received the support of transgender activist and actress Laverne Cox, who stars in the television series Orange Is the New Black.[3]\nA May 2012 press release by McDonald's support committee said the sentencing proceedings included statements from community leaders, clergy, and members of McDonald's family.[20](p1) McDonald's supporters held dance parties and rallies outside the Hennepin County jail in her honor,[11](p2) and over 18,000 people signed a Change.org petition calling for Freeman to drop the charges against McDonald.[20](p2)\nIn June 2012, a group calling itself the \"Queer Attack Squadron\" claimed responsibility for a Portland, Oregon incident throwing an unlit molotov cocktail through the window of a Wells Fargo bank as a gesture of solidarity with McDonald. Katie Burgess, executive director of the Trans Youth Support Network, said the group had no connection to McDonald's supporters in Minneapolis.[28][29] Burgess said the growth in support for McDonald and her self-defense argument was due to the perception McDonald was \"on trial for surviving a hate crime.\"[20](p1)\n\nPlea bargain (May 2012)[edit]\nDays before the trial was to begin, Moreno offered a plea bargain under which McDonald's charges of second-degree murder would be reduced to second-degree manslaughter, and under which she would have to admit only to criminal negligence rather than murder.[11](p4) On May 2, 2012, the defense and prosecution agreed on a 41-month sentence, the minimum sentence for second-degree manslaughter, as a compromise.[11](p6) In accepting the plea deal, McDonald had to relinquish her argument that she killed Schmitz in self-defense or by accident, and had to forego a trial by jury.[20](p1) McDonald said she accepted the plea deal for her loved ones: instead of risking decades in prison, the deal was expected to result in her being freed in a fraction of the time.[11](p6) On June 4, 2012, Moreno sentenced McDonald to 41 months in prison.[4] At her sentencing hearing McDonald told the court \"I'm sure that to Dean's family, he was a loving, caring person, but that is not what I saw that night. I saw a racist, transphobic, narcissistic bigot who did not have any regard for my friends and I.\"[3] McDonald was given credit for 245 days' jail time, and required to pay $6,410 in restitution for Schmitz's funeral expenses.[30]\n\nImprisonment[edit]\nWhile awaiting trial, McDonald was held in segregated custody and spent time under house arrest. In May 2012, Michael Friedman of the Legal Rights Center said there was \"no way\" McDonald would be \"sent to a women's prison.\"[20](pp1\u20132) Burgess said \"People tend to think about how CeCe identifies as a woman and say she should be able to go to a women's facility ... But there's really no history of transgender people being placed according to their gender identity. So once CeCe is placed in a permanent facility, she'll look around and decide if she feels safe there. If she doesn't, she'll move forward with a civil suit against the Department of Corrections to be relocated to a safer place. That may or may not be a women's prison.\"[22] After she was sentenced, McDonald expressed resignation, saying \"I've faced worse things in my life than prison.\"[11](p2)\nFollowing her conviction, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Corrections said officials had decided to place McDonald in the Minnesota Correctional Facility \u2013 St. Cloud, an adult male facility, though her final destination had yet to be determined;[31] and that the state would make its own determination of McDonald's gender.[32] The state's gender assessment concluded that McDonald would be held in a men's facility.[33] During her imprisonment a petition caused the Department of Corrections to administer the correct regimen of hormones. Despite being transferred to a second facility McDonald remained quartered with men throughout her imprisonment.[3]\n\nFlaherty assault case[edit]\nFlaherty, Schmitz's ex-girlfriend who was among those verbally assaulting McDonald and her friends outside the bar, was charged in May 2012 with second-degree assault with a deadly weapon and third-degree assault causing substantial bodily harm for attacking McDonald with \"an alcoholic drink\" glass causing a bleeding gash to her face needing eleven stitches.[24][34] Her case was referred to the Washington County Attorney's Office in order to avoid a conflict of interest.[11](p4) In April 2013, Flaherty was sentenced to six months' jail time and probation after pleading guilty to third-degree assault, and was given credit for 135 days served in jail.[35]\n\nRelease (January 2014)[edit]\nMcDonald was released on January 13, 2014, after serving 19 months and will remain under the supervision of the Minnesota Department of Corrections through her 41-month sentence.[36] Laverne Cox was among those who greeted her.[37] Roxanne Anderson, the program director for the Trans Youth Support Network, said \"CeCe is doing great. She looks good and she is good spirits,\" and that McDonald was not ready to comment publicly.[3] Chase Strangio, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said \"This is a day to celebrate, and to honor CeCe for all she's done from the day of her arrest to draw attention to the systemic violence women of color, and particularly LGBT women of color face everyday. Her message from the start was not to sensationalize the story, but to bring attention to the issue.\"[38]\nMcDonald gave her first televised interview six days later on Melissa Harris-Perry on MSNBC. McDonald spoke about her incarceration and those of other incarcerated transgender people, saying \"I felt like they wanted me to hate myself as a trans woman,\" and added \"prisons aren't safe for anyone, and that's the key issue.\" The segment also featured Katie Burgess, who said \"the only way that trans folks are going to be safe in prisons is for incarceration of people to end.\"[39]\n\nPost-incarceration[edit]\n McDonald with activist Joshua Allen on their Black Excellence Tour.\nIn 2014, McDonald was profiled by the Rolling Stone and included as part of the Advocate's annual \"40 Under 40\" list.[16][17] In August 2014 she was awarded the Bayard Rustin Civil Rights Award by the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club.[12]\nIn 2016, McDonald teamed up with gender non-conforming activist and prison abolitionist Joshua Allen for a Black Excellence Tour.[40][41]\n\nFREE CeCe![edit]\nFREE CeCe, a documentary about McDonald by Laverne Cox and Jac Gares, started production in August 2013.[18] The film is told through an interview with McDonald conducted by Cox, and deals with the events in 2011, McDonald's imprisonment and violence experienced by trans women of color.[19] FREE CeCe was the kick-off film at the 2016 San Francisco Transgender Film Festival, the world's first and longest-running transgender film festival.[41] Jac Gares, a New York City filmmaker, directed the film with Cox as executive producer.[41] Gares had previously produced the LGBT PBS series In The Life and raised $300,000 to fund FREE CeCe.[41]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nTransgender portal\nHistory of violence against LGBT people in the United States\nLGBT people in prison\nSignificant acts of violence against LGBT people\nTrans bashing\nViolence against LGBT people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"CeCe McDonald\".

A group of at least four white people outside the bar began harassing McDonald and her friends, calling the group, all of whom were African American, \"niggers\" and \"faggots.\" One of the men in the group, who would later be identified as Dean Schmitz, said \"look at that boy dressed like a girl tucking her dick in.\" As McDonald and her friends tried to walk away, Schmitz's ex-girlfriend Molly Flaherty hit McDonald in the face with a glass of alcohol and sliced open her cheek, causing an injury that would later require stitches. The groups began fighting, and when McDonald attempted to leave the scene, Schmitz followed. McDonald took a pair of scissors out of her purse and turned around to face Schmitz; he was stabbed in the chest and died from the wound.\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa Mannix, Andy (May 9, 2012). \"CeCe McDonald murder trial\".

[her] birth sex\".[1] While McGregor's father died, aged 42, in 1964 from a brain tumour, her mother survived him until 1992 and McGregor considered that transition would have \"appalled\" them and therefore chose not to transition until just after her 56th birthday, following a crisis point McGregor says she reached in November 2011 where she felt she had to commit to this path of transformation if she wanted to survive.[4] Even after transition, McGregor stated her brother (now deceased) refused to recognise her as female, and that her pre-transition 2001 marriage to her wife ultimately broke down (they divorced in 2016) as a result of her decision to transition.[4]\nMcGregor completed gender reassignment surgery in her early 60s and takes oestrogen. She has stated she is not attracted to men.[4]\n\nMilitary[edit]\nMcGregor joined the Australian Army as an Officer Cadet at the Royal Military College Duntroon on 14 January 1974, where she spent the next four years, before graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) at the end of 1977.[5] McGregor went on to serve in a number of junior command appointments in the 8th/9th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment at Enoggera Barracks in Brisbane, and in an Instructor appointment at the Army's Jungle Training Centre in Canungra.[3]\nIn the early 80s, not long after being promoted to Captain, McGregor resigned from the Army (later working for law firms McClellands and Sparke Helmore as an articled clerk, and for the Labor Party and Liberals as a speechwriter), before deciding to return to the Australian Army in 2001 after wanting to seek an operational deployment to East Timor (Timor-Leste).[3][4][6][7][8]\nAfter re-joining the Army, and having deployed to East Timor, McGregor went on to serve in a number of staff appointments at Army Headquarters, including acting as speechwriter to the Chief of Army between 2001 and 2014.[3] It was in this role that she worked for Lieutenant General David Morrison who served as Chief of Army between June 2011 and May 2015. McGregor wrote the script for the famous 12 June 2013 call-out message on YouTube in which Morrison told Army personnel that if they weren't willing to respect, and work with, women in the Army they should \"get out\". This message was prompted by repeated high-profile incidents of unacceptable behaviour towards women by serving Army members.[9][10]\nOn Australia Day in 2012, then Lieutenant Colonel McGregor was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the Military Division for \"exceptional service to the Australian Army as the Director of the Land Warfare Studies Centre\".[11]\nWhen McGregor advised David Morrison of her intent to transition and offered her resignation, Morrison \"refused to accept her resignation\".[12]\nMcGregor went public with her transition in November 2013 and as a result became the highest ranking transgender person in the Australian Defence Force at that time.[13]\nFollowing her public revelation in 2013, there followed a number of acrimonious social media exchanges about McGregor, in which McGregor took an active part, that led to her being formally counselled by the Australian Defence Force for conduct that reflected poorly on her judgment[14] and for which the Department of Defence made a payment in compensation to a complainant.[15]\nThen Lieutenant Colonel McGregor subsequently decided to leave the Army, transferring to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Reserve on 20 June 2014 as a Group Captain, to work on projects for the Chief of Air Force.[16] McGregor is no longer employed by the Air Force.[4]\n\nMilitary Honours and Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember of the Order of Australia (AM)[11]\n26 January 2012\n\n\n\nAustralian Service Medal[1]\n\n\n\n\nDefence Long Service Medal[1]\n(25\u201329 years of service)\n\n\n\nAustralian Defence Medal[1]\n\n\nCricket[edit]\nFrom 2011 McGregor has been a cricket writer for The Spectator,[17] a cricket commentator for The Australian,[18] and the Australian Financial Review,[19] and the author of a book, An Indian Summer of Cricket, published on 24 November 2012.[20] In a 2012 review, Tony Abbott, then federal Leader of the Opposition, described the book as \"the best sort of book about sport\" for \"those who think that sport can be a metaphor for life\". Abbott called the Chief of Army's launch of the book \"a fitting salute to [moral] courage\"[21]\nIn late 2016, McGregor resumed her cricket career playing for a Canberra women's cricket team, and stated she wished to play in the Women's Big Bash League.[22][23]  It is reported that she uses drug therapy, has high levels of oestrogen and no longer produces testosterone.[23]\nIn December 2018, McGregor was dumped as an ABC cricket commentator, something which she described as having \"unravelled\" her life.[1]\n\nQueenslander of the Year[edit]\nIn 2015 McGregor was named as Queenslander of the Year, despite not living in Queensland,[24] and as such became a finalist for 2016 Australian of the Year,[25] which was subsequently awarded to her previous commanding officer, David Morrison. She described the selection of Morrison as a \"weak, conventional choice\",[26] a comment for which she subsequently apologised.[27]\nIn December 2016 McGregor was removed from the Australian of the Year honour roll at her request. She has stated that the awards are a \"farce\" and that she regrets having accepted one.[28] McGregor has also argued that the awards are being used by activists.[29]\n\nPost-military career[edit]\nMcGregor is a regular commentator on Sky News and in The Australian.[30][31]\nMcGregor was also, for a time, patron of Kaleidoscope Australia, a not-for-profit organisation focused on promoting and protecting the rights of LGBTI people in the Asia Pacific region.[32] In September 2016, however, McGregor was dropped as patron by Kaleidoscope Australia because of her criticism of the Safe Schools program.[33][34][35] In May 2018, McGregor declared she had been wrong to oppose the Safe Schools program. \"It's an excellent program, and it saves lives... I should have been a supporter from the start... I regret that I wasn't... Young trans people need an ally... I could have helped, and I didn't, and I regret that\".[36]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nCricket portal\nLGBT portal\nTransgender portal\nMilitary of Australia portal\nTransgender people in sports\nWomen's National Cricket League\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i McGregor, Catherine (15 November 2019). \"Return of the prodigal daughter\".

She underwent gender confirming surgery in Thailand at the age of 18 in the middle of her first year in college.[12] Mock earned a Bachelor of Arts in Fashion Merchandising from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2004 and a Master of Arts in Journalism from New York University in 2006.[16][17]\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter graduating from New York University, Mock started working at People magazine, where she was a staff editor for more than five years.[17] Her career in journalism shifted from editor to media advocate when she came out publicly as a trans woman in a 2011 Marie Claire article, written by Kierna Mayo in Mock's voice. Mock took issue with how the magazine represented her by stating that she was born and raised as a boy; she says she was always a girl.[18][19] Mock said, \"I was born in what doctors proclaim is a boy's body. I had no choice in the assignment of my sex at birth.... My genital reconstructive surgery did not make me a girl. I was always a girl.\"[20] In 2014, while promoting her book Redefining Realness, she reiterated that she did not choose the Marie Claire article title, and found it to have many problems.[14][21] The editor of that piece, Lea Goldman, would later tweet in support of Mock: \"To be fair, I do recall @janetmock & @kiernamayo taking issue with our @marieclaire hed, \"I Was Born a Boy.\" I went with it anyway. #regrets\"[22] Mock became a contributing editor at Marie Claire, where she has written articles about racial representation in film and television[23] as well as trans women's presence in the global beauty industry.[24][25]\nMock submitted a video about her experiences as a transgender woman to the \"It Gets Better\" project in 2011, and has written on a variety of topics for Marie Claire, Elle, The Advocate, Huffington Post and XoJane.[26][27][28]\nIn 2012, Atria Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, signed Mock to her first book deal for a memoir about her teenage years,[29] which was released as Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love & So Much More in February 2014. It is the first book written by a trans person who transitioned as a young person. Redefining Realness made The New York Times bestseller list for hardcover nonfiction, and contains her personal memories often alongside statistics or social theory.[14][8] Mock writes her book is about her personal experience as a trans woman of color.[30] In the author's note, she writes she is aware of her privilege in writing this book and telling her story.[30] She states in the author's note, \"There is no universal women's experience\".[30] Feminist critic bell hooks referred to Janet's memoir as, \"Courageous! This book is a life map for transformation\" while Melissa Harris-Perry said, \"Janet does what only great writers of autobiography accomplish\u2014she tells a story of the self, which turns out to be a reflection of all humanity.\"[31]\nShortly after signing her book deal, Mock left her position as an editor at People.com where she had worked for more than five years.[32] Mock went on to host TakePart Live and her own culture show, So POPular!, on Shift.[33] Mock has stated, in a Q&A with Tribune Business News, that her heroes and influences have been women writers such as Zora Neale Hurston, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, and Toni Morrison.[34] While taping So POPular!, she continued to work with MSNBC as a guest host for the Melissa Harris-Perry show, host of the Global Citizen Festival, and covered the White House Correspondence Dinner's red carpet for Shift. She is also a special correspondent for Entertainment Tonight.[35]\nIn April 2015, Oprah Winfrey invited Mock to be a guest on Super Soul Sunday for a segment titled, \"Becoming Your Most Authentic Self\" where she discussed \"proudly and unapologetically\" claiming her identities. In September 2015, Mock was invited back to join Winfrey's Super Soul Sessions where Mock discussed, \"Embracing The Otherness.\" In 2016, Mock was named to Oprah's SuperSoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders.[36]\nIn addition to Super Soul Sunday, Mock has appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher, Melissa Harris-Perry, The Colbert Report, and The Nightly Show.[37][38][2][39][40] She is featured in an LGBT documentary, The OUT List, which screened on HBO on June 27, 2013.[41] She is also featured in a 2011 documentary called Dressed.[42]\nIn 2012, Mock started a Twitter hashtag to empower transgender women, called #GirlsLikeUs, which received attention from several queer-media sites.[43][44][45][46] Also in 2012, she gave the Lavender Commencement keynote speech honoring LGBT students at the University of Southern California and delivered the commencement address for Pitzer College in 2015. She also served as co-chair, nominee and presenter at the 2012 GLAAD Media Awards.[16]\nIn June 2013, Mock joined the board of directors of the Arcus Foundation, a charitable foundation focused on great ape conservation and LGBT rights.[47]\nIn 2014, following the conviction of activist (and transgender woman of color) Monica Jones,[48] Mock joined a campaign against a Phoenix law which allows police to arrest anyone suspected of \"manifesting prostitution\", which targets transgender women of color. Mock tweeted, \"Speak against the profiling of #TWOC [trans woman of color], like Monica Jones. Tweet #StandWithMonica + follow @SWOPPhx [Sex Workers Outreach Project \u2013 Phoenix Chapter] now!\"[48]\nAlso in 2014, Mock was featured on the fifth anniversary cover of C\u2606NDY magazine along with 13 other transgender women \u2013 Laverne Cox, Carmen Carrera, Geena Rocero, Isis King, Gisele Alicea, Leyna Ramous, Dina Marie, Nina Poon, Juliana Huxtable, Niki M'nray, P\u00eache Di, Carmen Xtravaganza and Yasmine Petty.[49]\nHer book publisher, Atria, announced in March 2016 that Mock was working on her second memoir with them.[50] Surpassing Certainty, published in 2017, promised to \"pick up where Redefining Realness left off \u2013 chronicling 'the journey of finding her way, her voice, and her purpose in her 20s through a series of first experiences.'\"\nMock wrote a cover story for The Advocate on DeRay Mckesson, titled \"Why DeRay Mckesson Matters\",[51] as well as Marie Claire's November 2016 feature on Nicki Minaj, titled \"Nicki Minaj Is Here To Slay.\"[52]\nOn December 5, 2016, \"The Trans List\" aired on HBO.[53] The film was produced by Mock along with director Timothy Greenfield-Sanders. Mock also interviewed the cast, which features eleven prominent transgender figures: Laverne Cox, Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, Buck Angel, Kylar Broadus, Caroline Cossey, Shane Ortega, Alok Vaid-Menon, Nicole Maines, Bamby Salcedo, Amos Mac and Caitlyn Jenner.\nIn 2016, Mock wrote the foreword for On Christopher Street: Transgender Stories, a book of photos and stories by famed photographer, Mark Seliger.[54]\nIn 2017, Surpassing Certainty, Mock's second memoir, was published.[55] The book's title is an allusion to Audre Lorde, who wrote, \"And at last you'll know with surpassing certainty that only one thing is more frightening than speaking your truth. And that is not speaking.\"[56]\nThe television show Pose premiered on June 3, 2018, on FX. Mock is a writer, director, and producer on the show, and is the first trans woman of color hired as a writer for a TV series in history.[57] It follows the lives of five trans women in the New York ballroom scene in 1987. Pose \"looks at the juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in New York: the rise of the luxury Trump-era universe, the downtown social and literary scene, and the ball culture world.\"[58] The series has been congratulated for casting actual trans women in trans roles and for accurately depicting a unique queer subculture. In 2018 Mock directed the episode of Pose titled \"Love Is the Message\", thus making her the first transgender woman of color to write and direct any television episode.[59]\nIn 2019, Mock signed a three-year deal with Netflix giving them exclusive rights to her TV series and a first-look option on feature film projects; this made her the first openly transgender woman of color to secure a deal with a major content company.[60][61]\n\n\nFilmography[edit]\nTelevision[edit]\nThe numbers in directing and writing credits refer to the number of episodes.\n\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nCredited as\n\nNetwork\n\nNotes\n\n\nCreator\n\nDirector\n\nWriter\n\nExecutiveProducer\n\n\nPose\n\n2018\u2013present\n\nNo\n\nYes (3)\n\nYes (7)\n\nonly producer\n\nFX\n\n\n\n\nThe Politician\n\n2019\n\nNo\n\nYes (1)\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNetflix\n\n\n\n\nHollywood\n\n2020\n\nNo\n\nYes (2)\n\nYes (2)\n\nYes\n\nNetflix\n\nMiniseries\n\nHonors and awards[edit]\nIn November 2012, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project gave Mock their Sylvia Rivera Activist Award.[62]\nMock was included in the Trans 100, the first annual list recognizing 100 transgender advocates in the United States, and gave the keynote speech at the launch event on March 29, 2013, in Chicago.[63][64][65]\nOn November 14, 2013, Mock was honored as a member of the OUT100, Out's 100 \"most compelling people of the year\" and introduced Laverne Cox as the recipient of the Reader's Choice Award at the event. She was also named one of Good's GOOD 100 for \"Building An Online Army to Defend #GirlsLikeUs.\"[66]\nMock was included in the video accompanying the Google Doodle for International Women's Day 2014.[67]\nIn April 2014, GLSEN presented Mock with the Inspiration Award at the GLSEN Respect Awards[68] and in October, the Feminist Press honored her activism at the Women & Power Gala.[69]\nIn 2014, Mock also was included as part of The Advocate's annual \"40 Under 40\" list, as well as their list of 50 Most Influential LGBT People in Media.[70][71] That year, she was also included in the annual Root 100; this list honors \"standout black leaders, innovators and culture shapers\" aged 45 and younger,[72] and Planned Parenthood presented the Maggie Award for Media Excellence in \"Social Media Campaign\" to Mock for her work in creating a powerful and safe space for trans voices online and beyond through her #RedefiningRealness Tumblr page.[73]\nIn 2015, Time named her one of \"the 30 Most Influential People on the Internet\" and one of \"12 New Faces of Black Leadership\"[74][75] and Fast Company included Mock as one of 2015's \"Most Creative People in Business.\"\nIn February 2015, the American Library Association honored Redefining Realness with the Stonewall Book Award.[76] Later that year, Mock's book was nominated as a Lambda Literary Award finalist in the category of transgender non-fiction[77] and The Women's Way awarded Mock with their Book Prize.\nIn June 2015, Mock received the inaugural Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz award from CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies \u2013 an award that is given to an individual who promotes Queer Studies in their work or activism.[78]\nAlong with Tiq Milan and Candis Cayne, Mock accepted an award in honor of Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera's lives and work at the 2016 LOGO Trailblazer Honors. She referred to Johnson and Rivera as her \"fairy godmothers because they created the blueprint for our liberation.\"[79]\nMock was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.[80]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMock lives in New York City. She married photographer Aaron Tredwell in 2015. The couple filed for divorce in February 2019.[81]\n\nControversies[edit]\nIn February 2014, Mock joined Piers Morgan Live on CNN, for a face-to-face interview.[82] After the show aired, the interview resulted in a Twitter feud between the Piers Morgan Live team and Mock. She accused them of \"sensationalizing her life\"[83] by focusing on her personal and physical life instead of her new book, Redefining Realness. Mock told BuzzFeed that Morgan did not \"really want to talk about trans issues, he wants to sensationalize my life and not really talk about the work that I do and what the purpose of me writing this book was about.\"[83] Morgan received criticism from the LGBTQ community, resulting in Mock's second invitation onto the show.[84] Morgan attempted to understand the root of the criticism as Mock explained the problem with the way trans bodies and their lives are represented in mainstream media.[85]\nTo address the controversy, Mock appeared on The Colbert Report on February 18, 2014, where the host skewered Morgan and gave Mock space to speak about her book, advocacy and the need to listen to trans people when they declare who they are.[39] In an interview with Fusion's Alicia Menendez, Mock and Menendez \"flipped the script\" and used the Morgan interview as a teaching lesson by putting Mock on the questioning end of the interview to flip the conversation around gender.[86] Mock as the interviewer asked Menendez to prove her gender with questions like \"do you have a vagina\" to prove that she is cisgender, interrogating the ways in which trans people are questioned by the media.[87]\nIn March 2016, Mock canceled a speech at Brown University after students protested the invitation by Hillel, an organization with explicitly pro-Zionist views.[88][89]\n\nBooks[edit]\n2014: Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love & So Much More.

She attributed her entry into composing and arranging largely to the influence and encouragement of the Canadian light music composer Robert Farnon. Morley transitioned in 1972 and thereafter lived openly as a transgender woman.[3] Later in life, she lived in Scottsdale, Arizona.[4]\nMorley won three Emmy Awards for her work in music arrangement. These were in the category of Outstanding Music Direction, in 1985, 1988 and 1990, for Christmas in Washington and two television specials starring Julie Andrews. Morley also received eight Emmy nominations for composing music for television series such as Dynasty and Dallas. She was twice nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Original Song Score: first for The Little Prince (1974), a nomination shared with Alan Jay Lerner, Frederick Loewe, and Douglas Gamley; and second for The Slipper and the Rose (1976), which Morley shared with Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. She was the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an Academy Award.[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Pre-transition work\n2.2 Work as Angela Morley\n2.3 Work in the United States\n\n\n3 Personal life\n\n3.1 Death\n\n\n4 Legacy\n\n4.1 Genre\n4.2 Characteristics of her compositions\n\n\n5 Selected discography\n\n5.1 credited as Wally Stott\n5.2 credited as Angela Morley\n\n\n6 Selected filmography\n7 Awards and honours\n\n7.1 Awards\n7.2 Nominations\n\n\n8 See also\n9 Footnotes\n10 References\n11 Further reading\n12 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nMorley was born in Leeds, Yorkshire[6] on 10 March 1924 under the name of Walter \"Wally\" Stott.[1][2][4][3] Morley's father was a watchmaker who played the ukulele-banjo, and the family lived above their jewellery shop.[6] Morley's mother also sang.[6] Morley was a fan of dance music before being able to read the labels on the records, listening notably to Jack Payne and Henry Hall as a child,[6] and began learning the piano at the age of eight on a Challen upright piano.[6] Morley's father died of angina[3] in 1933[4] at the age of 39, after which the family moved to Swinton and Morley ceased piano lessons.[6][3] Morley then tried playing violin at age 10 and the accordion at age 11, including in competitions, before choosing the clarinet and alto saxophone as primary instruments, taking clarinet lessons and playing in the school orchestra.[6] Morley then played in the semi-professional band led by Bert Clegg in Mexborough.[6]\nAs a mostly self-taught musician able to sight-read, Morley left school at age 15 to tour with Archie's Juvenile Band, earning a weekly wage of 10 shillings,[6] and also worked as a projectionist.[3] Morley's mentor at this time was the pianist Eddie Taylor.[6] Morley continued to play saxophone in British dance bands during the period of World War II, joining the Oscar Rabin Band as lead alto in 1941, at age 17.[6] With this band, Morley began writing arrangements for pay[6] and made a recording debut with the tracks \"Waiting for Sally\" and \"Love in Bloom\".[4] Morley later joined Geraldo's band, which performed for BBC Radio several times a week,[6] in 1942[1][7] or 1944[2].[6][4] With Geraldo's band Morley gained experience arranging for bands of many sizes and styles.[6] Morley studied harmony and musical composition in London with the British-Hungarian composer M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber and conducting with the German conductor Walter Goehr.[6] Morley's early work was also influenced by Robert Farnon and Bill Finegan.[2]\n\nCareer[edit]\nPre-transition work[edit]\nAt the age of 26, Morley stopped playing in bands to instead work solely as a writer, composer, and arranger,[6] and would go on to work in recording, radio, television, and film.[1] Morley was originally a composer of light music[2] or easy listening,[3] best known for pieces such as the jaunty \"Rotten Row\" and \"A Canadian in Mayfair\", the latter dedicated to Robert Farnon.[4] Morley also worked with the Chappell Recorded Music Library and Reader's Digest.[4][6]\nMorley is known for writing the theme tune, with its iconic tuba partition, and incidental music for Hancock's Half Hour in both its radio and television incarnations,[1][2][8] and was also the musical director for The Goon Show from the third series in 1952 to the last show in 1960, conducting the BBC Dance Orchestra.[2] At this time, Morley was known to work quickly and would sometimes write music for The Goon Show the same day of recording,[1] which consisted of two full-band arrangements per week and incidental music.[7] Another short but remembered theme composed by Morley was the 12-note-long \"Ident Zoom-2\", written for Lew Grade's Associated TeleVision (ATV), in use from the introduction of colour television in 1969, until the demise of ATV in 1981. By 1953, Morley was also scoring films for the Associated British Picture Corporation under music director Louis Levy.[6]\nIn 1953, Morley became musical director for the British section of Philips Records,[1][2][3] arranging for and accompanying the company's artists alongside producer Johnny Franz. Morley notably worked with Frankie Vaughan on \"The Garden of Eden\" in 1957.[4] In 1958, Morley began an association with Welsh singer Shirley Bassey, including work for Bassey's recordings of \"The Banana Boat Song\" (1957), \"As I Love You\" (1958), which reached no. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1959,[3] and \"Kiss Me Honey Kiss Me\" (1958).[4] Morley was the head of an orchestra and a chorale at this team, releasing records as \"Wally Stott and His Orchestra\" and \"The Wally Stott Chorale\" respectively.[3] Morley also worked with artists such as No\u00ebl Coward and Dusty Springfield[7] and on the first four solo albums by Scott Walker.[2][9] The next hits Morley worked on were Robert Earl's \"I May Never Pass this Way Again\" and Gene McDaniels' \"Tower of Strength\",[4] which peaked at no. 5 on the USA charts.[10]\nIn 1962 and 1963, Morley arranged the United Kingdom entries for the Eurovision Song Contest, \"Ring-A-Ding Girl\" and \"Say Wonderful Things\", both sung by Ronnie Carroll.[4] The former was conducted on the Eurovision stage in Luxembourg. Morley was also credited with a rhythmic drum solo in the 1960 horror film Peeping Tom, which a dancer plays on a tape recorder.[2][11]\nIn 1961, Morley provided the orchestral accompaniments for a selection of choral arrangements made by Norman Luboff for an RCA album that was recorded in London's Walthamstow Town Hall. The New Symphony Orchestra (an ad hoc recording ensemble) was conducted by Leopold Stokowski, and the choir of professional British singers, as rehearsed by Luboff, performed such favourites as \"Deep River\", Handel's \"Largo\", Bach's \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\", Rachmaninoff's \"Vocalise\", under the album's title Inspiration (also later reissued on a BMG Classics CD). In 1962, Morley arranged and conducted the RCA Red Seal debut album Romantic Italian Songs for Italian-born tenor Sergio Franchi, and later did the arrangements and conducting for Franchi's 1963 RCA album, Women in My Life.\nSome of Morley's other notable works in the years before transitioning include the composition and arrangement for the films The Looking Glass War, released in 1970,[1][11] and When Eight Bells Toll, released in 1971.[1][11] Morley stepped back from the music and film industry between 1970 and 1972[3] in order privately to undergo gender transition.[7] During this time, Morley studied clarinet chamber music at the Watford School of Music for eighteen months.[3]\n\nWork as Angela Morley[edit]\nAfter transitioning to living publicly as a woman in 1972,[3] Morley continued to work in music, now using the name Angela Morley professionally. Due to worries about how she would be received publicly as a transgender woman, she declined opportunities to appear on television, such as on The Last Goon Show of All in 1972, though she continued to work with many of her previous colleagues.[1] She had to be persuaded by Franz to continue conducting because of the scrutiny she might face.[3] One of her first projects upon her return to public life was as an orchestrator on Jesus Christ Superstar. She then orchestrated, arranged, and aided in the composition of the music for the final musical film collaboration of Lerner and Loewe, The Little Prince, released in 1974.[1][11] Her contribution to the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Music, Scoring Original Song Score and/or Adaptation[2][12] and she travelled to California for the award ceremony.[6]\nMorley was also the composer, conductor, arranger and orchestrator for the Sherman Brothers' musical film adaptation of the Cinderella story, The Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella in 1976, however she was only credited as conductor and arranger.[13] She was again nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Music, Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Best Adaptation Score for this film along with the Sherman Brothers[2][14] and again was present at the award ceremony.[6] Though initially reluctant, citing lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with the novel, Morley wrote most of the score for the animated Watership Down film, released in 1978.[1] She had to work quickly based on work drafted by Malcolm Williamson, then Master of the Queen's Music, who left the project.[1][2][15] At this time, she was a regular guest conductor of the BBC Radio Orchestra[2] and BBC Big Band.\n\nWork in the United States[edit]\nFollowing the success of Watership Down, Morley lived for a time in Brentwood, Los Angeles, where she began working for Warner Bros.[6] She permanently relocated to Los Angeles in 1979[3] and began working primarily on American television soundtracks, including those of Dynasty, Dallas, Cagney & Lacey, Wonder Woman[1], and Falcon Crest,[2] working with the music departments of major production companies, including Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox Television.[6]\nThanks to a mutual friend, Herbert W. Spencer, Morley collaborated with John Williams throughout the 1970s and 1980s, arranging for the Boston Pops Orchestra under Williams' direction and working on films such as Star Wars, Superman, The Empire Strikes Back, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Hook, Home Alone, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, and Schindler's List,[6][16] though in an uncredited capacity.[11] She also collaborated with Andr\u00e9 Previn,[7] Lionel Newman,[7] Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa,[2][7] and Richard Rodney Bennett.[2] Later, she would work with soloists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman.[7] She was nominated six times for Emmy Awards for composing[2] and won three times for music direction,[2] notably of two Julie Andrews television specials.[17]\nMorley continued to work in television until 1990.[2] She relocated again to Scottsdale, Arizona in 1994, where she recorded two CDs with the John Wilson Orchestra.[4] She also lectured at the University of Southern California on film scoring[4] and founded the Chorale of the Alliance fran\u00e7aise of Greater Phoenix.[6] Her last film credit was for the Disney film The Hunchback of Notre Dame II in 2002, where she worked as an additional orchestrator and composer of additional music.[11]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMorley was a transgender woman and began transitioning to live openly as a woman in 1970, at the age of 46.[1] According to her friend and colleague Max Geldray, she struggled with her gender identity throughout her life,[1][3] and according to her wife, Christine Parker, Morley probably tried hormone replacement therapy at some point before they met.[3] Morley underwent sex reassignment surgery in Casablanca in June 1970 and publicly came out as a woman in 1972.[3][Footnotes 1] She chose the new surname Morley as it was her mother's maiden name.[2][3]\nMorley was twice married.[2] Her first wife, Beryl Stott, was a singer and choral arranger who founded the Beryl Stott Singers, also known as the Beryl Stott Chorus or Beryl Stott Group.[2][3] Beryl Stott died prior to Morley's gender transition.[1][7] Morley met Christine Parker, also a singer, in London,[3] and they married on 1 June 1970.[2] Parker was a major support to Morley through her transition. Morley stated that: \"It was only because of her love and support that I then was able to deal with the trauma, and begin to think about crossing over that terrifying gender border.\"[1][2][3]\nThe couple moved to Los Angeles in 1979 following the success of Watership Down, and owned a house in the San Fernando Valley.[3] They moved to Scottsdale, Arizona in 1994.[4] Morley died in Scottsdale on 14 January 2009 at the age of 84,[3] as a result of complications of a fall and a heart attack.[18] As of November\u00a02015[update], Parker was still living in Scottsdale.[1]\nMorley had two children with her first wife Beryl Stott: a daughter, Helen, who predeceased her in 1967, and a son, Bryan,[3] who was living as of January\u00a02009[update].[2][7][18] She also had grandchildren and great-grandchildren at the time of her passing.[18]\nMorley had many friendships with fellow musicians and industry colleagues. While working on The Goon Show, she made the acquaintance of Peter Sellers, and would eventually share fond memories of him to his biographer Ed Sikov.[2] She and Max Geldray continued to be good friends following her transition.[2] She also noted that she was lifelong friends with Herbert W. Spencer from 1955, while working on Gentlemen Marry Brunettes, until his death in 1992.[3]\n\nDeath[edit]\nMorley died in Scottsdale, Arizona[4] on 14 January 2009 at the age of 84.[1][2][3][18] Her death was a result of complications of a fall and a heart attack.[18] Her death was almost exactly 50 years since her no. 1 hit with Shirley Bassey, \"As I Love You\".[3]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nMorley's talent was noted by many of her peers. Arranger Tony Osborne said that she was \"at the top of the range [...] second only to Robert Farnon, and it was a pretty close run thing at that\", while Scott Walker compared working with Morley to working with Frederick Delius.[4]\nMorley was interviewed for the biography of her Goon Show colleague Peter Sellers by his biographer Ed Sikov prior to the book's publication in 2002.[3] When asked by Sikov how she should be identified in the book, she told him: \"It\u2019s a judgment you\u2019ll have to make and I\u2019ll have to accept\".[3] Sikov chose to refer to her as Wally Stott in the context of her past work but as Angela Morley in the present;[3] most posthumous writing about her follows a similar pattern.[1][2][4][3][7]\nIn 2015, BBC Radio 4 produced a radio drama about Morley, 1977, which was written by Sarah Wooley.[19][20] 1977 is a semi-fictional account of the year in which Morley was enlisted to complete composition of the musical soundtrack to the film Watership Down in three weeks, after Master of the Queen's Music Malcolm Williamson left the project.[1] The radio drama, starring Rebecca Root, was rebroadcast in 2018.[19]\nMorley's work has been compared to that of Wendy Carlos, given that they were both transgender women composing film scores in the same time period, though they never met; notably, the composer and researcher Jack Curtis Dubowsky analysed and compared their careers and styles in a chapter of his book Intersecting Film, Music, and Queerness.[3] As a prominent and early transgender woman working in film, Morley has also been compared to trans women in the film industry who came out in later years, such as Lana Wachowski.[3] In this vein, the film scholar Laura Horak promotes a broader view of the term \"filmmaker\" when it comes to transgender and gender variant individuals in film history,[21] noting that:\n\nMost of the time, making films and videos is a collaborative endeavour. Despite the many creative contributions of writers, cinematographers, producers, editors, actors, and others, we too often credit films to the director alone. This habit fundamentally misrepresents the filmmaking process, as film scholars Berys Gaut and C. Paul Sellors have argued. If we want to trace a history of trans and gender variant people\u2019s audiovisual creativity, we should look for them both in and beyond the director\u2019s chair.\u2014\u2009Laura Horak, Tracing the History of Trans and Gender Variant Filmmakers, p. 10\nHorak includes Morley among her selected list of trans and gender variant filmmakers as a composer, noting in particular her work on The Little Prince and Watership Down alongside the film works of other transgender and gender variant people in Classical Hollywood cinema such as Dorothy Arzner and Christine Jorgensen.[21]\nMorley is commemorated by a Rainbow Plaque placed by Leeds Pride at the entrance to the BBC Leeds building.[22]\n\nGenre[edit]\nMorley's work was influenced by a number of genres and styles. She initially played in British dance bands, and spent much of her career composing music that was labelled as light and easy listening, as well as film scores and television soundtracks. Light music and easy listening were generally not taken seriously or given much respect at the time that Morley was composing,[3] which Dubowsky credits partially to misogyny, due to the genre's association with femininity.[3] Dubowsky acknowledges that the genre has been seen as derivative, bourgeois, and (in America) racially exclusionary, but calls for the genre and Morley's work to be reconsidered for its influence on film music and the technical skill required in its production.[3] He also, in the conclusion to his chapter on Morley and Wendy Carlos, questions whether Morley was drawn to light music for its perceived feminine qualities.[3]\nBeyond her light and easy listening work, Morley collaborated with many kinds of artists at Philips Records, from folk music to rock and roll, produced her own recordings of music from Christmas music to show tunes,[3] and later focused her attention on orchestral, classical and choral arrangements that went beyond the scope of light music and easy listening.[6]\nMorley credited her eventual turn away from film scores to technological changes: tape recording, new types of microphones, and the advent of stereophonic sound had reached the wider music industry, but not film.[6] She wrote that \"to go to a cinema to hear one\u2019s latest score was absolute torture.\"[6] Nevertheless, she continued to work intermittently in film until 2002.[11]\n\nCharacteristics of her compositions[edit]\nHer music for The Goon Show stood out as having \"a jazz flavour, rather than the standard comedy-show music of that time.\"[2] From some of her earliest composition works, Morley used instruments to represent characters, such as the tuba notes in the theme to Hancock's Half Hour which represented Tony Hancock.[2] While Morley was working with Johnny Franz at Philips Records, Robert Earl noted that Morley and Franz \"didn't believe in fade-out endings so all those ballads end on big notes\".[4]\nHer work on film scores is noted for her \"mastery of orchestration and gift for evoking moods and atmospheres\" (in reference to The Slipper and the Rose and Watership Down)[7] and \"her strengths in swing, classical, and romantic period styles\" (in reference to Watership Down).[3] For Watership Down, Morley created a character theme for Kehaar, voiced by Zero Mostel.[3] On \"Kehaar's Theme\", Dubowsky notes the influence of Claude Debussy and comments that:\n\nFor this theme, Morley takes a fragment of the opening flute motive of Debussy\u2019s 'Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l\u2019apr\u00e8s midi d\u2019un faune' [...] and spins it into a majestic, soaring, romantic swing waltz, an amalgamation of her work in French romantic style orchestral scoring and big band swing. Alto sax takes the tune; the surrounding orchestration has a rich, symphonic, romantic, classical Hollywood sound, not unlike the orchestrations Morley did for John Williams. In addition to this mastery of style and technique, the opening I\u2013bVI progression is fresh and contemporary; the 'borrowed' bVI chord had been used in earlier psych rock but would become prominently featured in the 'new wave' popular music of the time.\n[...] Morley\u2019s handling of 'Kehaar\u2019s Theme' and its orchestral accompaniment shows a technique well honed not just from film work, but from years of working in 'light music' where romantic accompaniments and swing tunes were frequently employed. While not an 'easy listening' version of Debussy, 'Kehaar\u2019s Theme' nevertheless suggests how one might conceive of such a thing and execute it with finesse.\u2014\u2009Jack Curtis Dubowsky, Intersecting Film, Music, and Queerness, p. 125-126\nHe also notes that \"Kehaar's Theme\" incorporates polyrhythms and has an emphasis on string instruments, and that it draws from many of the genres Morley worked in: \"classical, swing, jazz, light music, concert music, and film scoring\".[3] Speaking more broadly about the Watership Down score, Dubowsky also notes the effectiveness of \"Violet's Gone\" and \"Venturing Forth\".[3]\n\nSelected discography[edit]\ncredited as Wally Stott[edit]\nNo\u00ebl Coward, I'll See You Again (1954), Philips (as arranger)\nLondon Pride (1958), Philips\nChristmas by the Fireside (1959), Marble Arch Records\nDiana Dors, Swingin Dors (1960), Pye (as arranger)\nRoy Castle, Castlewise (1961), Philips (as arranger)\nSusan Maughan, Sentimental Susan (1964), Philips (as arranger)\nHarry Secombe, Film Favourites (1964), Philips (as arranger)\nHarry Secombe, Italian Serenade (1966), Philips (as arranger)\nScott Walker, Scott (1967), Philips (as arranger)\nShirley Bassey, Love For Sale (1968), Philips (as arranger)\nScott Walker, Scott 2 (1969), Philips (as arranger)\nScott Walker, Scott 3 (1969), Philips (as arranger)\nSpellbound (2008), Vocalion Records (reissue)\ncredited as Angela Morley[edit]\nThe Slipper and the Rose (1976), MCA Records/EMI Records\nWatership Down (1978), CBS Records\nSoft Lights and Sweet Music: the Scores of Angela Morley (2001), Vocalion Records\nThe Film and Television Music of Angela Morley (2003), Vocalion Records\nSelected filmography[edit]\nThe Heart of a Man (1959)\nThe Lady Is a Square (1959)\nPeeping Tom (film) (1960).

They are known for playing the role of Angel Evangelista in the FX television series Pose.[3] Time magazine named the actor one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019.[4] Moore is transgender and non-binary,[5][6] and uses they/them pronouns.[7][8][6]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Early work\n2.2 Pose television series\n2.3 Present projects\n2.4 Upcoming projects\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 Filmography\n\n4.1 Film\n4.2 Television\n4.3 Music videos\n\n\n5 Awards and Nominations\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nA Bronx native, Indya Moore is of Haitian, Puerto Rican, and Dominican ancestry.[9] At the age of 14, they left their parents' home due to their parents' transphobia, and entered into foster care.[10] They moved around frequently during this time, eventually living in all five boroughs of New York City. After being frequently bullied, Moore dropped out of high school during their sophomore year.[11] They began working as a model at the age of 15, and eventually earned their General Equivalency Diploma (GED).[11][12]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly work[edit]\nMoore became a model at the age of 15, and began working shoots for Dior and Gucci, despite the fashion industry's initial treatment of them as a risky choice.[11]\nAlthough Moore was booking modeling gigs, they became increasingly disenchanted with the fashion industry and its emphasis on body image. Moore met legendary dancer and ballroom veteran Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza while doing background for the television series The Get Down. He encouraged them to pursue acting and sent Moore to an audition for the independent film Saturday Church.[11] Moore landed the role of Dijon, and the film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival.[13] The Hollywood Reporter called it \"sweet and soulful\".[14] The film was later released on January 12, 2018 by Samuel Goldwyn Films.[15]\nIn early 2017, Moore walked in New York Fashion Week and was photographed for Vogue Espa\u00f1a. That year, Moore appeared in Katy Perry\u2019s music video for the single \u201cSwish Swish\u201d, and performed live with Perry on the May 20, 2017 episode of Saturday Night Live,[16][17][18] where they were credited as a member of the House of Xtravaganza.[19]\n\nPose television series[edit]\nIn late 2017, Moore was cast in Pose, Ryan Murphy's FX television series about New York City ball culture in the late 1980s.[20][13] Moore portrays Angel Evangelista, a transgender sex worker who joins the House of Evangelista after leaving the House of Abundance with her friend Blanca. While working at the piers, she meets Stan, a yuppie played by Evan Peters, and becomes his mistress.[21]\nThe series premiered on June 3, 2018, and attracted critical acclaim.[22][23] The first season boasted the largest cast of transgender actors ever for a scripted network series with over 50 transgender characters.[20][24] On July 12, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 11, 2019.[25]\n\nPresent projects[edit]\nIn 2018, Moore signed a contract with IMG Models and William Morris Endeavor (WME). Moore was WME's first signed contract with a trans actor.[26] Moore also started the production company Beetlefruit Media, which provides a platform for stories about disenfranchised groups.[27]\nMoore has appeared in J.View's 2017 \"Don't Pull Away\" music video, and in Blood Orange's 2018 \"Saint\" video.[28]\nIn May 2019, Moore became the first transgender person to be featured on the cover of the U.S. version of Elle magazine.[29]\nIn December 2019, Moore debuted as the voice of Shep on the animated limited series Steven Universe Future. The character is also non-binary.[30]\n\nUpcoming projects[edit]\nMoore will appear in the upcoming horror television series, Magic Hour, a gender-bending recreation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, directed by Che Grayson and filmed in Tokyo, on which they also serve as an executive producer.[21][31] Moore is set to appear in the short film Spot.[32] Moore has been cast in the sequel to the 2019 psychological thriller film Escape Room which is scheduled to be released on January 1, 2021.[33]\nIn June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, Queerty named them among the fifty heroes \u201cleading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people\u201d.[34][35]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMoore is transgender[36] and non-binary[5][6] and goes by they/them pronouns.[7][8][6] Moore has spoken openly about their lifelong struggles with the bullying and transphobia that caused them to leave home at 14 and drop out of school in the 10th grade.[10]\nIn an interview with Pose co-star, Mj Rodriguez, Moore discussed how, despite identifying as non-binary, being seen as a woman means they are still subjected to the same  \"surveillance and scrutiny\" as women, and to a desire to use fashion to take back that power:[5]\n\nMOORE: I feel like that about fashion. I feel like that about us having the autonomy to express ourselves. I'm non-binary but I don't really talk about it that much. I don't feel like people really are there yet for understanding it, which I don't mind, but I also acknowledge the way people see me as a woman. And because I'm seen as a woman, a cis woman or binary presenting, people are  going to hold me up to those same standards that women are held up to.\nRODRIGUEZ: Which you're saying you shouldn't be, right?\n\nMOORE: Which I'm saying women should not be.[5]\nIn December 2018, Moore came out as polyamorous.[37][38]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2017\n\nSaturday Church\n\nDijon\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nSpot\n\nBusinesswoman\n\nShort film\n\n\n2019\n\nQueen & Slim\n\nGoddess\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nThe One\n\nDr. Watkins\n\nShort film\n\n\n2020\n\nMagic Hour\n\nBella\n\nShort film; also executive producer\n\n\n2020\n\nA Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting\n\nPeggy Drood\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\nEscape Room 2\n\nTBA\n\nPost-production\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2018\u2013present\n\nPose\n\nAngel Evangelista\n\n18 episodes\n\n\n2019\n\nSteven Universe Future\n\nShep\n\nEpisode: \"Little Graduation\" (voice acting role)\n\n\nMusic videos[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nArtist\n\n\n2017\n\n\"Don't Pull Away\"\n\nLead Girl\n\nJ.Views (ft.

She was known particularly for the Pax Britannica trilogy (1968\u20131978), a history of the British Empire, and for portraits of cities, including Oxford, Venice, Trieste, Hong Kong, and New York City. She published under her birth name, James, until 1972, when she had gender reassignment surgery after transitioning from male to female.\nAs James Morris, she was a member of the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition, which made the first ascent of the mountain.[3] She was the only journalist to accompany the expedition, climbing with the team to a camp at 22,000 feet on the mountain and famously having the successful ascent announced in The Times on 2 June 1953, the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 Awards\n5 Works\n6 References\n\n6.1 Notes\n6.2 Citations\n\n\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nBorn in Clevedon, Somerset, England, to an English mother and Welsh father, Morris was a chorister in the choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, while boarding at Christ Church Cathedral School.[5] Morris then went on to be educated at Lancing College, returning to Christ Church, Oxford, as an undergraduate. Despite being born and largely raised in England, Morris always identified as Welsh.[6] In the closing stages of the Second World War, Morris served in the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, and in 1945 was posted to the Free Territory of Trieste, during the joint British\u2013American occupation.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter the war Morris wrote for The Times, and in 1953 was its correspondent accompanying Edmund Hillary, whose expedition was the first to scale Mount Everest. Morris reported the success of Tenzing Norgay and Hillary in a coded message to the newspaper, \"Snow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement\",[7] and by happy coincidence the scoop was published in The Times on the morning of the coronation of Elizabeth II.[8] The message was initially interpreted to mean that Tom Bourdillon and Tenzing had reached the summit, but the first name was corrected before the story was broken. Claims that the news was held back ignore the communication problems of the time; it was quite an achievement to get the news to London by Coronation Day, as it had to be sent to Namche Bazaar by runner.[9]\nReporting from Cyprus on the Suez Crisis for the Manchester Guardian in 1956, Morris produced the first \"irrefutable proof\" of collusion between France and Israel in the invasion of Egyptian territory, interviewing French Air Force pilots who confirmed that they had been in action in support of Israeli forces.[10] Morris reported on the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann.[11] Later Morris opposed the Falklands War.[12]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1949, Morris married Elizabeth Tuckniss, the daughter of a tea planter; they had five children together, including the poet and musician Twm Morys. One of their children died in infancy. They lived together in the village of Llanystumdwy, in North Wales, for over 50 years until Morris' death in November 2020, first at her ancestral home Plas Trefan, and latterly in a converted stable block, Trefan Morys, in the grounds.[13][14]\nMorris began transitioning to life as a woman in 1964, one of the first high-profile people to do so.[1]:105[15] In 1972, Morris travelled to Morocco to undergo sex reassignment surgery, performed by surgeon Georges Burou,[1]:135\u2013144 because doctors in Britain refused to allow the procedure unless Morris and Tuckniss divorced, something Morris was not prepared to do at the time.[1]:127 They divorced later, but remained together and on 14 May 2008 were legally reunited when they formally entered into a civil partnership.[3][16] After James became Jan, she detailed her transition in Conundrum (1974), her first book under her new name, and one of the first autobiographies to discuss a personal gender reassignment.[17][note 1]\nMorris died on 20 November 2020 at Ysbyty Bryn Beryl (Bryn Beryl Hospital) in Pwllheli in North Wales, at the age of 94.[2] Her death was announced by her son Twm.[2]\n\nAwards[edit]\nMorris received honorary doctorates from the University of Wales and the University of Glamorgan, was an honorary fellow of Christ Church, Oxford, and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She received the Glynd\u0175r Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Wales in 1996.[18] She accepted her CBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours \"out of polite respect\", but Morris was a Welsh nationalist republican at heart.[19] In 2005, she was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for \"a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature\".[20][21] In January 2008, The Times named her the 15th greatest British writer since the War.[16] She has featured in the Pinc List of leading Welsh LGBT figures.[22] She won the 2018 Edward Stanford Outstanding Contribution to Travel Writing Award.[23]\nIn an interview with BBC in 2016 she told Michael Palin that she does not like to be described as a travel writer, as her books are not about movement and journeys; they are about places and people.[24]\n\nWorks[edit]\nSee also: Jan Morris bibliography\nMorris' 1974 best-selling memoir Conundrum documented her transition and was compared to that of transgender pioneer Christine Jorgensen (A Personal Autobiography).  Later memoirs included Herstory and Pleasures of a Tangled Life.  She also wrote many essays on travel and her life and published a collection of her diary entries as In My Mind's Eye in 2019.[25]\nMorris wrote many books on travel particularly to Venice and Trieste.  Her Pax Britannica trilogy, on the history of the British Empire, received praise.[26]  Morris' 1985 novel Last Letters from Hav, an \"imagined travelogue and political thriller\" was shortlisted for that year's Booker Prize.[27] A second volume of diary entries is due to be published in January 2021. Allegorizings, a book of personal reflections written in and before the 2000s and that she stipulated not be published in her lifetime, is also due to be issued in 2021.[26]\n\nReferences[edit]\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ The opening lines of Conundrum: \"I was three or perhaps four years old when I realized that I had been born into the wrong body, and should really be a girl. I remember the moment well, and it is the earliest memory of my life.\"\n\n\nCitations[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d Morris, Jan (2006). Conundrum. New York Review of Books.

He started his athletic career before transitioning, started his transition in 2010, and in 2015 earned a spot on the Team USA sprint duathlon men's team for the 2016 World Championship, making him the first known out trans athlete to join a U.S. national team different from his sex at birth.[5][6]\nWhile he qualified, Mosier was uncertain about his eligibility to compete in the Duathlon Age Group World Championship Race in Spain in June 2016 due to the International Olympic Committee policy around the participation of transgender athletes,[7]  with specific provisions from the Stockholm Consensus in 2004.[8] In 2015, Mosier challenged the policy,[9] resulting in the creation and adoption of new IOC guidelines for the participation of transgender athletes.[10] Mosier was considered the catalyst for change in the policy in January 2016,[11] after he successfully advocated for change in the policy[12] to allow his participation in the World Championship and future races. Following the policy change, in 2016 Mosier raced in the International Triathlon Union Sprint Duathlon World Championship race in Aviles, Spain, becoming the first known transgender athlete to compete in the World Championship race.[13]\nIn 2020 Mosier became the first openly transgender male athlete to ever compete in an Olympic trial alongside other men; however, he was unable to finish the race due to injury.[14]\nMosier began competing in triathlon in 2009 as female. In 2010, Mosier publicly self-identified as a transgender man[15] in The Advocate, an American LGBTQ+ magazine, after competing in his first race as male. In 2011 Mosier was featured in The New York Times[1] prior to competing in the Nautica New York City Triathlon, a race he competed in two years prior as female.\nIn 2016 Mosier was chosen as the first openly transgender athlete to be featured in the \"Body Issue\" of ESPN The Magazine.[16]\n\nContents\n\n1 Activism\n2 Gender transition\n3 Coaching activity\n4 Athletic achievements\n5 Awards\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nActivism[edit]\nMosier is the founder[17] of transathlete.com, a resource for students, athletes, coaches, and administrators to find information about trans inclusion in athletics at various levels of play. He also works with LGBTQ sports leagues to improve transgender inclusion. Mosier has spoken across the world about inclusion in sports, his experience as a transgender athlete, athlete activism, and creating more inclusive spaces.[18]\nIn 2019, Mosier joined the Board of Directors of Point of Pride, a non-profit which works to benefit trans people in need through gender-affirming support programs that empower them to live more authentically.[19]\nMosier was previously the Vice President of Program Development and Community Relations for You Can Play,[20] an organization that works to ensure the safety and inclusion of all in sports - including LGBTQ athletes, coaches, and fans.[21]\nPreviously, Mosier was the Executive Director of GO! Athletes, a national non-profit network of current and former LGBTQ high school and college student-athletes which creates safer spaces in athletics through visibility, education, and advocacy.[22]\n\nGender transition[edit]\nMosier struggled with gender identity at a young age. He knew at the age of four years that his gender identity (male) and biological sex (female) did not match. He began his transition in 2010 when he legally changed his name, and then began to receive testosterone injections. By making this transition, Mosier gave up his top ranking in the women's category.[23]\nMosier spoke about his experience with Chicago GoPride, saying, \"Competing as a woman, I thought about gender all the time, to a point where it interfered with my ability to be successful because I didn't feel comfortable at races. Now, I feel more able to focus and gender doesn't come up as much.\"[24]\n\nCoaching activity[edit]\nMosier is a USA Triathlon certified coach. He has also been a coach and ambassador for the Empire Triathlon Club in NYC since 2012,[25] and in 2017 began coaching at EDGE Athlete Lounge in Chicago, Illinois.[26] In 2014, he was named 2014's Best Personal Trainer of the Northeast[27] by Competitor Magazine.\n\nAthletic achievements[edit]\nMosier made Team USA for the first time in sprint duathlon in 2015.[28] He made the long course duathlon team in 2016 at a race in Cary, North Carolina.[29] Mosier made his fourth Team USA team in long course duathlon in the 2017 National Championship, where he placed 2nd in his age group.[30]\nIn 2016, Mosier earned All-American honors in duathlon.[31]\nIn 2019, Mosier won two National Championships in Race Walking.[32]\nIn 2020, Mosier competed in the US Olympic Team Trials for the 50k Racewalk event; however, he was unable to finish the race due to injury.[33] As such, he became the first known transgender athlete to compete in the Olympic Trials in the gender with which they identify.[34]\n\nAwards[edit]\nIn 2011, Mosier was one of three finalists for the Compete Magazine Athlete of the Year award in 2011.\nIn 2011, Mosier was given an honorable mention by USA Triathlon for the 2011 USAT Spirit of Multisport Awards.[35] Mosier was honored for his work in promoting trans visibility and LGBT inclusion in multisport and his commitment to advocating for all people to have the opportunity to feel safe, compete, and thrive in sports. \nIn 2013, Mosier was named Athlete of the Year[36] at the Compete Sports Diversity Awards in Los Angeles, California.\nMosier was named to the 2014 Trans 100 list. The \"Trans 100\" is an annual list of some of the most prominent and influential individuals who identify as trans and are actively working towards creating a better world for the transgender community.[37]\nIn 2014, Mosier was named as an inductee into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame, thus making him the first openly transgender man inducted.[38][39]\nIn 2014 Mosier was also included as part of The Advocate's annual \"40 Under 40\" list.[38]\nIn 2014, he was named 2014's Best Personal Trainer of the Northeast[27] by Competitor Magazine.\nIn 2015, Mosier was honored by USA Triathlon as the 2014 Jeff Jewell Spirit of Multisport award winner.[40]\nIn 2015, Mosier was awarded the Sports Pillar Award from the World OutGames Miami 2017 at the organization's Bronze Bash event.[41]\nIn 2016, Mosier was named Outsports Person of the Year.[42]\nIn 2016, Mosier was named to the Out Magazine OUT100 list.[43]\nIn 2016, Mosier earned All-American honors in duathlon.[31]\nIn 2018, Mosier was named as a Beyond Sport Ambassador.[44]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Dreier, Frederick (August 6, 2011). \"For Transgender Triathlete, a Top Finish in New York Is Secondary\".

After signing with Avex Trax, Nakamura released her debut single, \"Yogoreta Shitagi\" in 2006. She attracted public attention after coming out as transgender woman publicly via her official website on 11 September 2006.\nNakamura's second single \"Tomodachi no Uta\", which details her struggling with the sexuality and unrequited love for her friend, became her breakthrough hit, reaching number nine in Japan. Her debut studio album, Ten Made Todoke, was released in January 2007 and certificated Gold by Recording Industry Association of Japan. Her fourth studio album Sh\u014dnen Sh\u014djo (2010) won the 52nd Japan Record Awards for Excellence Album Award. In May 2011, Nakamura released her first compilation album, Wakage no Itari.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Music career\n\n2.1 2004\u20132005: Switch to Avex Trax and Ten Made Todoke era\n2.2 Late 2007\u20132008: Watashi wo Daite Kudasai era\n2.3 2009: Ashita wa Haremasu You Ni era\n2.4 2010: Sh\u014dnen Sh\u014djo era\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 Musical style\n5 Discography\n\n5.1 Singles\n5.2 Studio albums\n5.3 Compilation Albums\n5.4 Cover Albums\n\n\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nAtaru Nakamura was born on 28 June 1985, in Sumida, Tokyo. Her parents divorced when she was little, and she was raised by her mother. Nakamura began studying music early in her life, teaching herself to play the piano at the age of ten, and beginning to write her own songs at fifteen.\n\nMusic career[edit]\n2004\u20132005: Switch to Avex Trax and Ten Made Todoke era[edit]\nIn 2006, she switched to a major label, the popular Avex Trax. Her first major label single, \"Yogoreta Shitagi\", was released on her birthday, and received minor attention.  \"Yogoreta Shitagi\" was written about an ex-boyfriend who was cheating on her and is written from the former boyfriend's point of view. Nakamura called this individual on the telephone to explain that the song she had written about him was to be her debut single.\nHer second single, \"Tomodachi no Uta\", received greater attention, and placed at number 150 on the Oricon charts. However, it was not until Nakamura came out as a transgender female that she received major attention. Her explanation garnered a lot of media attention, and her single rose to number 9 on the Oricon charts.  \"Tomodachi no Uta\" became the theme song for the popular television drama Watashi ga Watashi de Aru Tame ni, a primetime television drama about a young transsexual woman. Nakamura even received a small cameo appearance on the program.\nNakamura wrote \"Tomodachi no Uta\" when she was fourteen years old; notably, it was the first song she ever wrote.[citation needed] She wrote the song to say goodbye to the friends in junior high she would never see again. \"Tomodachi no Uta\" was featured in an Avex Trax musical titled \"Kokoro no Kakera\". The soundtrack featured 21 songs chosen from the company's hits over the past two decades.\nHer third single, \"Watashi no Naka no Ii Onna\", entered the Oricon charts at number 39. On the same day \"Watashi no Naka no Ii Onna\" was released, the song \"Chewing Gum\" written by Nakamura for the band AAA, debuted on the Oricon chart. Her two songs competed with one another for four weeks.\nHer first album, Ten Made Todoke, was released on 1 January 2007. A month later, she released \"Kaze ni Naru\", her fourth single. \"Kaze ni Naru\" was the theme song for the film Sakebi.\nHer song \"Kakeashi no Ikizama\" was used as the closing theme for the anime series Reideen.\n\nLate 2007\u20132008: Watashi wo Daite Kudasai era[edit]\nNakamura's fifth single marked the promotion of her second album titled Watashi wo Daite Kudasai. The album was released on 5 December 2007. \"Ringo Uri\", the album's first single, premiered on 27 June 2007, and peaked at number 30 on the Oricon charts. The album's second single, \"Hadaka Denky\u016b\", premiered on 21 November. \"Tori no Mure\", the album's third single and her seventh overall, received minor airplay.\n\n2009: Ashita wa Haremasu You Ni era[edit]\n\"Kaze Tachinu\" debuted on 9 July 2008. The song was used as the theme song for the live-action film GeGeGe no Kitaro Sennen Noroi Uta. The single did well and was received much like \"Tomodachi no Uta\". Nakamura appeared at AP Bank Fes' 08, a musical festival, on 20 July 2008, to promote the single.\nNakamura released \"Kotonakare Shugi\", a rock song produced by Kameda Seiji, on 17 December 2008.[1]\nShe wrote a song called \"Hare-butai\" for Jero, Japan's first black enka singer.[2]\nAshita wa Haremasu You Ni was Nakamura's third studio album, released on 25 February 2009 in both standard and deluxe editions, the latter containing a DVD containing various performances and music videos.[1]\n\n2010: Sh\u014dnen Sh\u014djo era[edit]\nIn 2010 Ataru Nakamura switched her management from Avex Trax to Yamaha Music Communications. She released the single \"Iede Shoujo,\" which debuted at No. 90 on the Oricon charts and sold 796 copies the first week. On 9/22 her album came out titled Sh\u014dnen Sh\u014djo it debuted at No. 65 on the Oricon and sold 2,103 copies the first week. The album was later awarded a Japan Record Award, despite its lack of commercial success.[3]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nNakamura was assigned male at birth but transitioned after struggling with issues of gender identity.[4] This was mentioned in her official biography short during her appearance at the 2007 Kouhaku Uta Gassen.[5]\n\nMusical style[edit]\nNakamura is notable for the two different styles in which she sings. Her first style is a modern rock/pop sound. Her second style is an enka-inspired sound; thus far her enka-styled ballads have been her largest successes. Her singles have thus far alternated between these two styles.\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSingles[edit]\nYogoreta Shitagi (\u6c5a\u308c\u305f\u4e0b\u7740, Dirty Underwear) (2006) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak \u2013 No. 155\nTomodachi no Uta (\u53cb\u9054\u306e\u8a69, Poem of Friends) (2006) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak \u2013 No. 9\nWatashi no Naka no \"Ii Onna\" (\u79c1\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u300c\u3044\u3044\u5973\u300d, The Good Woman in Me) (2006) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak \u2013 No. 39\nKaze ni Naru (\u98a8\u306b\u306a\u308b, Become the Wind) (2007) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #103\nRingo Uri (\u30ea\u30f3\u30b4\u58f2\u308a, Apple Seller) (2007) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #30\nHadaka Denky\u016b (\u88f8\u96fb\u7403, Naked Light Bulb) (2007) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #87\nKaze Tachinu (\u98a8\u7acb\u3061\u306c, Not Standing Up to the Wind) (2008) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak \u2013 No. 27\nKotonakare Shugi (\u4e8b\u52ff\u308c\u4e3b\u7fa9, Peace at Any Price) (2008) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak \u2013 No. 65\nIede Shoujo (\u5bb6\u51fa\u5c11\u5973, Runaway Girl) (2010) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak \u2013 No. 90\nIkutoshituki (\u5e7e\u6b73\u6708, How Many Years and Months) (2014) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak \u2013 No. 103\nKoko ni Iruyo (\u3053\u3053\u306b\u3044\u308b\u3088, I am Here) (2015) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak \u2013 No. 103\nStudio albums[edit]\nTen Made Todoke (\u5929\u307e\u3067\u3068\u3069\u3051, Reach Heaven) (2007) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #29\nWatashi o Daite Kudasai (\u79c1\u3092\u62b1\u3044\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044, Please Embrace Me) (2007) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #38\nAshita wa Haremasu Y\u014d Ni (\u3042\u3057\u305f\u306f\u6674\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3046\u306b, May Tomorrow Be a Clear Day) (2009) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #59\nShounen Shoujo (\u5c11\u5e74\u5c11\u5973\u306b, Boy-Girl) (2010) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #65\nKikoeru (\u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b, I Can Hear It) (2012) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #76\nSekai no Mikata (\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u307f\u304b\u305f, The Way We Look the World) (2014) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #67\nKyonen mo, Kotoshi mo, Rainen mo (\u53bb\u5e74\u3082\u3001\u4eca\u5e74\u3082\u3001\u6765\u5e74\u3082\u3001, Last Year, This Year, and Next Year Too) (2015) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #106\nBet\u0101 h\u0101fu (\u30d9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30cf\u30fc\u30d5, Better Half) (2017)\nRutsu bo (\u308b\u3064\u307c, Crucible) (2018)\nMijuku mono (\u672a\u719f\u3082\u306e, Immature) (2020)\nCompilation Albums[edit]\nWakage no Itari (\u82e5\u6c17\u306e\u81f3\u308a, Youthful Mistakes) (2011) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #101\nCover Albums[edit]\nNiban-senji (\u4e8c\u756a\u714e\u3058, Rehashes) (2011) \u2013 Oricon Weekly Charts Peak: #102\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Ataru Nakamura Discography Archived 16 December 2008 at the Wayback Machine Retrieved on 16 July 2009.

She is of mixed maternal Indian, Ceylonese and paternal Malay descent.[3] Nisha has memories of when she was a child and used to wear a \u201cselendang\u201d (shawl) while dancing to Bollywood songs. Nisha was raised by her mother Christian family after her father's death when she was six years old. Her mother is a Muslim convert. At nine years old, Nisha participated in a fancy dress competition, as a ballerina wearing a black dress and a wig. At the time, she realized that was the real Nisha.[3]\n\nBiography[edit]\nAs a transgender woman, Nisha has faced law enforcement where Islamic sharia laws are enforced. Under a provision of Sharia (Islamic law) a male person is prohibited from dressing or behaving like a woman and appearing in public that way. Violation of this is punishable by a fine of 1,000 ringgit (approximately US$257) and a jail term for period of six months to a year. Sharia law is enforced by the state Islamic religious departments. Under this law, Ayub was imprisoned for three months in 2000.[4][5][6][7] While Nisha was imprisoned in a male prison, the warden and other prisoners sexually assaulted her.[5] Ayub said of her time in the prison: \"They asked me to strip naked in front of everyone.

In the proclamation, San Diego mayor Kevin L. Faulconer said: \"Nisha Ayub continues to fight for the equality and protection of all people in her country and beyond its borders.\"[9]\nIn 2018, a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Agriculture of University Putra Malaysia, Leena Wong alongside lead study author Patrick Krug from California State University, Los Angeles, discovered a new species of sea slug  that camouflages itself as seaweed, and upon confirmation that it was indeed a new species, named it Sacoproteus nishae after Nisha.[10] The sea slug was named so due to its ability to camouflage itself after seaweed[11] calling \"it the best example of an animal masquerading as a plant\".\nIn 2019, Nisha became the only Malaysian on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) 100 Women of 2019 list. She was recognised by BBC for her work in assisting the local transgender community.[12]\n\nAwards and accolades[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nOrganization\n\nAward\n\nReference\n\n\n2015\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch\n\nAlison Des Forges Award for Extraordinary Activism\n\n[5]\n\n\n2016\n\nUnited States Department of State\n\nInternational Women of Courage Award\n\n[2]\n\n\n2019\n\nBBC\n\nBBC 100 Women of 2019\n\n[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Nisha Ayub's tough fight for transgender rights is ongoing\".

Due to the outrage and because it was not socially acceptable, her photos were not published and no company would work with her any longer. It was at this point when she knew that her modeling career had ended. After the difficult time, she decided to move to Paris. There she was able to sign a 6-month contract with Balenciaga. Once that contract ended, Norman found a lack of work in Milan and moved back to New York where she signed with Grace del Marco Agency. This agency didn't give her much work and Norman had accepted that her modeling career was basically over. She ended up taking a job at Show Center, where she performed in a burlesque peep show for trans women. Ever since she has been active in the drag ball community.\n\nCareer revitalization[edit]\nAfter a biographical piece was written about Norman in December 2015 by New York Magazine's digital fashion site \"The Cut\", Clairol reached out to Norman and in 2016 announced that Norman would become the face of their 'Nice 'n Easy Color As Real As You Are' campaign. Clairol global associate brand director Heather Carruthers stated that the company was \"honored to bring back Tracey Norman as a woman who no longer has to hide her truth.\" The campaign focused on the \"confidence that comes from embracing what makes you unique and using natural color to express yourself freely.\"[4] In 2016 Norman and Geena Rocero became the first two openly transgender models to appear on the cover of an edition of Harper\u2019s Bazaar.[5]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nNorman says the feeling of being different goes back as far as she can remember. In a cover story for New York Magazine she said \"it just seemed like I was living in the wrong body. I always felt female.\"[6] For Norman her life at home as well as school was not easy. She had a father who was battling cancer and a family to whom she was afraid to come out.\nNorman was able to keep her gender identity a secret for a long time. It wasn't until the day that she graduated high school that she gathered the courage to come out to her family\u2014including her mom, which was the hardest according to Norman. Although she was nervous to tell her family, she was relieved when her mother extended her arms for a big hug\u2014she felt safe and at home.[1] Her mother admitted that she had always known.[6]\nAfter coming out to her family, she wanted to start to transition but that wasn't an easy process.[6] She ran into an old classmate who had gone through the same transition.[6] This is when she learned that she could take birth control pills, without the placebo, to become the woman she always was.[6] A little after, she started going to trans clubs and this is where she found a doctor who did under-the-table hormone shots.[6] These shots are what gave her a feminine body, her breasts grew and she started to lose weight.[6] Realizing her feminine identity took slightly longer than it did to come out. It took her a few months after graduation to finally find herself wandering into S. Klein, a department store in Newark where she grew up, and buying her first dress. It wasn't until a full year after her graduation that she felt like she could pass as a woman in broad daylight in public.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ a b c d e Yuan, Jada; Wong, Aaron (December 14, 2015). \"The First Black Trans Model Had Her Face on a Box of Clairol\".

O'Connell amassed over 500 career victories throughout her career.\nO'Connell never psychologically felt like a man.  She had sex reassignment surgery in 1994 following a near-fatal 1991 motor accident. \"I was trapped upside down, engine throttle stuck, fuel running all over the racetrack and me. The accident didn't scare me, but the thought that I hadn't lived life to its full potential just ran chill bumps up and down my body.\" She legally changed her name from J. T. Hayes to Terri O'Connell.\nO'Connell, a former model, also created the first apparel company for the female race fan called \"Speedsters\" in 1995. She also owns an Apparel/Art Company, \"Dangerous Curves Society\".

Hayes to Terri O'Connell.\nO'Connell, a former model, also created the first apparel company for the female race fan called \"Speedsters\" in 1995.

Before her transition in 1999,[1] she served in the cold war intercepting Soviet bomber planes, and was involved in the Gulf War and Bosnia Conflict.[2] She switched to Battlefield Helicopters in 1992 and flew several operational tours post-transition, including, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, before her retirement from the military in November 2014.\n\nMilitary career[edit]\nCaroline developed an interest in aviation as a teenager and achieved an RAF Flying Scholarship leading to a Private Pilots Licence when she was 17. She joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1980 and after completing Navigator Training at RAF Finningley she was posted to Phantom F4s in the Air Defence role at RAF Leuchars. Caroline flew 1500 hours on F4s and intercepted 34 Soviet long-range bomber aircraft when on Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) during the Cold War, she also completed tours providing Air Defence in the Falkland Islands. In 1989 she was posted to 63 Squadron RAF Chivenor flying Hawk T Mk1A on the Tactical Weapons Unit as an instructor/training officer for navigators undergoing Fast Jet conversion training and introducing student pilots to two-seat crew operations. In 1990 she was deployed with just one hours notice to Saudi Arabia, to help set-up and run a tactical air operations centre following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and in the buildup to the Gulf War.[2] After completing her tour at Chivenor she accepted a request for fast jet navigators to re-role to Support Helicopters, to provide fast jet experience of operating a pilot/navigator cockpit on tactical operations.\nUpon completing helicopter training at RAF Shawbury she was posted to 60 Squadron at RAF Benson flying the Westland Wessex HC2. The following year Caroline completed a Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course, the beginning of a very active role in the training and preparation of crews for operational tactical flying. In 1995 she joined a UN Anglo-French Rapid Reaction Force (RRFOR) team operating from Kiseljak, Bosnia, where she became responsible for the co-ordination and safe routing of UN helicopter operations within Bosnia. She remained in Bosnia with NATO forces when they took on responsibility following the cease-fire.\nIn 1997 Caroline helped set up the newly created Rotary Wing Operational Evaluation and Training Unit (RWOETU) at RAF Benson where she was responsible for the initial operational development and introduction of the new AW101 Merlin HC Mk3 helicopter into RAF service. In 1998 Caroline finally accepted she needed to resolve her lifelong battle with her gender identity and after informing the RAF of her need to transition she was accepted in service as a female officer. Eighteen months later she was publicly 'outed' on the front page of The Sun newspaper (10 August 2000). After a short tour at RAF Innsworth on the Recruiting Policy desk, working on the implementation of ethnic minority recruiting policy, she successfully agreed her return to RAF Benson, to join No 28 (AC) Squadron ready for its reformation as the first Squadron to receive the Merlin HC Mk3 Battlefield Helicopter. On completion of No.1 Merlin Operational Conversion Course Caroline worked to prepare and develop crew tactical readiness for the Squadron's deployment to Bosnia in 2003, in support of SFOR, and for Iraq in 2005. This experience saw her returning to RWOETU where she worked hard to evolve the aircraft platform protection systems and tactical training for crews, helping to improve survivability for crews and troops flying in hostile environments.  Over a five-year period this work was recognised with two Commander Joint Helicopter Command Commendations for 'Exceptional Service' with a 3rd Commendation from the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force in the Queen's New Year Honours List of 2012.  During this period Caroline also completed a further three tours in Iraq, operating Merlin helicopters with 1419 Flt, and formed part of an Operational Evaluation team deploying to Afghanistan for the first Merlin deployment in 2009 and again in 2010. In 2011 she returned to 28 (AC) Sqn and completed a further two tours flying in Afghanistan. In her final two years of service she also helped RWOETU with the development and running of the European Defence Agency (EDA) Helicopter Tactics Course, instructed crews on the first two of these courses and advised EDA Project teams on future platform protection requirements for rotary wing aircraft. Her final role was to lead an EDA Mentor Team to Portugal in 2014 to train, evaluate and advise European helicopter crews participating in EXERCISE HOTBLADE 14, a multinational flying exercise involving military helicopters from six European nations. Caroline served in the RAF for thirty-five years and remained flying in thirty-four of them, she completed seventeen operational tours.\n\nTransitioning gender in the military[edit]\nFollowing her transition in early 1999 Caroline was influential in promoting transgender equality and inclusion in the UK Armed Forces. Her 2000 public 'outing' by The Sun newspaper led to much criticism of the decision to allow her to remain in the military. Critical, though unofficial and unqualified, voices declared transgender people would be a liability, especially if they were allowed to serve with front-line forces.  UK Policy now permitted transgender individuals to serve in the military but, whilst the majority of personnel accepted the change in policy, very few understood what it meant to be transgender or how inclusion could succeed, they needed assurance that it was the correct decision.  Caroline realised being a trailblazer and role model bore enormous responsibility; she had to succeed if she was going to prove her opponents wrong and to do that she would have to earn respect and be valued, not just as a member of the military but as someone who wasn't 'a liability on the front-line', in fact someone who was needed.  In proving her own worth she also determined to help make the military a more inclusive environment for those following in her footsteps. She became an Equality and Diversity Adviser for the military in 2000, trained as a Mentor, became a member of the RAF LGBT Forum and Proud2Serve support groups, and participated as a key note speaker at several military conferences and training events throughout the UK.  Her role as a trailblazer, positive role-model and champion of diversity in the UK Armed Forces earned her a Permanent-Under-Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Peoples Award in 2011.\nCaroline quickly saw the benefit of her open and honest approach as attitudes became more positive and understanding grew into support. Trailblazing in the military as a trans woman provided many difficult challenges but the unconditional support and friendship of so many of her colleagues, including those from all three services who had never met or worked with her directly, was a major factor in making the UK military the permissive and inclusive workplace it became, for her, for transgender individuals following, for people with other diverse challenges, for anyone.\nIn 2014 Caroline advised the Palm Center, San Francisco State University, regarding a national commission offering implementation guidance seeking the inclusion of openly serving transgender personnel in the US military.  Caroline was invited as a key panel member at a conference on 'Perspectives on Transgender Military Service From Around the Globe', held in Washington DC, co-sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Palm Center. She also co-authored an Op-ed with Petty Officer Landon Wilson for CNN, entitled 'Both Transgender, but Unequal Paths in Military Service' http://cnn.it/12ka78t; and was interviewed on BBC The World Radio http://bit.ly/126yshT. Caroline has enrolled with Stonewall on their School Role Models Programme where she contributes her story to support, educate and inspire people and to illustrate the positive values of respect, diversity and inclusion.  Caroline contributes to the Huffington Post at http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/caroline-paige/\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Paterson, Michael (14 August 2000). \"RAF navigator has sex swap\".

There, she studied at Kneller Hall, the Royal Military School of Music.[1]\nShe later studied composition at the Royal Academy of Music with Richard Rodney Bennett, winning the Eric Coates Prize and The Boosey and Hawkes Prize and during her studentship taught clarinet to second study students. She was appointed a Fellow of The Royal Academy of Music in 1994.[4]\n\nJethro Tull[edit]\nMain article: Jethro Tull (band)\nGoing about her early career as a jobbing arranger and conductor of recording sessions, Palmer recorded her first album project, Nicola, in 1967 with Bert Jansch. She was then referred to Terry Ellis, then manager of the early Jethro Tull, which was making its first album at Sound Techniques Studio in Chelsea, London. At short notice, Palmer came up with arrangements for the horns and strings on the Mick Abrahams composition, \"Move on Alone\" from the This Was album. This work and professional performance endeared her to the band[5] and she was soon to visit them again, with a string quartet arrangement to \"A Christmas Song\". Palmer arranged string, brass, and woodwind parts for Jethro Tull songs in the late 1960s and early 1970s, before formally joining the group in 1976 and primarily playing electronic keyboard instruments.\nIn 1980, leader Ian Anderson intended to release the album A with other musicians as a solo project, but was persuaded by his record label to release it instead under the Jethro Tull name. This resulted in every member of the group, including Palmer, leaving except guitarist Martin Barre and Anderson himself. Palmer formed a new group, Tallis, with former Jethro Tull pianist and organist John Evan. The new group was not commercially successful, and Palmer returned to film scoring and sessions.[citation needed]\n\nSolo work[edit]\nBeginning in the 1980s, Palmer produced several albums of orchestral arrangements of the music of various rock groups, including Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, the Beatles and Queen.[6]\nIn 2017 Palmer announced the release of her first solo album, Through Darkened Glass, which was released in January 2018 and has the guest appearance of former band-mate Martin Barre.[7][8][9]\nIn August 2019 Palmer appeared, alongside Barre, at Fairport's Cropredy Convention.[10]\n\nGender transition[edit]\nIn 1998, Palmer came out as transgender and intersex, changing her name to Dee. Palmer was born with genital ambiguity, assigned male at birth, and underwent several surgeries, the last in her late twenties. Palmer said her gender dysphoria had been a part of her life since she had been young, and that the dysphoria \"started to reassert itself again\" in the year following the death of her wife Maggie in 1995.[11][12][13]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSolo[edit]\nThrough Darkened Glass (2018)\nWith Jethro Tull[edit]\nProviding orchestral arrangements\n\nThis Was (1968)\nStand Up (1969)\nBenefit (1970)\nAqualung (1971)\nThick as a Brick (1972)\nA Passion Play (1973)\nWar Child (1974)\nMinstrel in the Gallery (1975)\nToo Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!

As a child, she attended public schools in Milwaukee. Park received a B.A. in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, an M.Sc. in European studies from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a Ph.D. in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nActivism[edit]\nIn 1997, Park co-founded Queens Pride House, a center for the LGBT communities of Queens, and Iban/Queer Koreans of New York.  In 1998, Park co-founded the New York Association for Gender Rights Advocacy (NYAGRA), the first statewide transgender advocacy organization in New York.\nPark served as coordinator of the work group which led the campaign for the transgender rights law enacted by the New York City Council (Int. No. 24, enacted as Local Law 3 of 2002).[1]  She served on the working group that helped to draft guidelines\u2014adopted by the Commission on Human Rights in December 2004\u2014for implementation of the new statute.[2]\nPark negotiated inclusion of gender identity and expression in the Dignity For All Students Act (DASA), a safe schools bill enacted by the New York State Legislature in 2010,[3] and the first fully transgender-inclusive legislation introduced in that body.[4]  She also served on the steering committee of the coalition that secured enactment of the Dignity in All Schools Act by the New York City Council in  September 2004. In 2005, Park became the first openly transgender person chosen to be grand marshal of the New York City Pride March, the oldest and largest pride event in the United States.\nIn January 2012, Park participated in the first US LGBTQ delegation tour of Palestine. In June 2015, she was the keynote speaker at the Queer Korea Festival/Seoul Pride Parade, the largest event in the history of the LGBT community Korea up to that date, with a crowd estimated at more than 35,000. In 2009, Park was named 'a leading advocate for transgender rights in New York' on Idealist in NYC's 'New York 40.' In December 2011, she was designated one of the 'official top 25 significant queer women of 2011' by Velvetpark. In October 2012, Park was one of 54 individuals named to a list of 'The Most Influential LGBT Asian Icons' by the Huffington post. In November 2012, she was named to a list of '50 Transgender Icons' for Transgender Day of Remembrance 2012.[5]\n\n Pauline Park's Visibility Project portrait\nOther[edit]\nShe is the subject of Envisioning Justice: The Journey of a Transgendered Woman, a 32-minute documentary about her life and work by documentarian Larry Tung that premiered at the New York LGBT Film Festival (NewFest) in 2008.[6]\nIn 2010, Park recorded \"Barricades Myst\u00e9rieuses\", which includes keyboard music by Couperin, Bach, Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, and Debussy.[7]\nIn 2015, Park joined a group of Korean adoptees returning to Korea in search of information about their birth parents and relatives. Park's trip, which also coincided with the Queer Korea Festival that preceded the Seoul Pride Parade of that year, was the subject of a biographical documentary short film, Coming Full Circle: The Journey of a Transgendered Korean Adoptee, also directed by Tung.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ KEVIN ALLISON (2003-07-18). \"Parking rights Pauline Park is fighting for transgender rights\".

For the 1973 Western film, see Charley One-Eye.\nCharley Darkey ParkhurstBorn1812Sharon, VermontDiedDecember 18, 1879Watsonville, CaliforniaResting placePioneer Cemetery, Watsonville, CaliforniaOccupationStagecoach driver, farmer, rancher\n Headstone at Pioneer Cemetery, Watsonville, California\n Tombstone of Mary Parkhurst, mother of Charley Parkhurst, and wife of Ebenezer Parkhurst. Location, Broad Brook Cemetery in Sharon, Vermont.\nCharley Darkey Parkhurst, born Charlotte Darkey Parkhurst (1812\u20131879),[1] also known as \"One-Eyed Charley\" or \"Six-Horse Charley\", was an American stagecoach driver, farmer and rancher in California. Born and raised a girl in New England, Parkhurst ran away as a youth, taking the name Charley and began living as a man. He started work as a stable hand and learned to handle horses, including to drive coaches drawn by multiple horses. He worked in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, traveling to Georgia for associated work.\nIn his late 30s, Parkhurst sailed to California following the Gold Rush in 1849; there he became a noted stagecoach driver. In 1868, he may have been the first female to vote in a presidential election in California.[1][2] After his death was it was discovered that his sex was female and he had given birth at an earlier time.[3] Given the lack of autobiographical account, it has never been settled for certain whether Charley was a transgender man, or a woman who used a persona to be able to do work and have freedoms that would not have been allowed for women during that time. Both feminists and transgender rights advocates have equal reason to find Charley's story inspiring.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n2 Posthumous revelation\n3 1868 vote\n4 Legacy and honors\n5 Representation in popular culture\n6 References\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nCharley Parkhurst was born Charlotte Darkey Parkhurst[1][2] in 1812 in Sharon, Vermont, to Mary (Morehouse) Parkhurst and Ebenezer Parkhurst.[4] Parkhurst had two siblings, Charles D. (1811\u20131813) and Maria. The mother, Mary, died in 1812. Some time after Charles D. died,  Charley and Maria were taken to an orphanage in Lebanon, New Hampshire. (Some sources say Charley was born there.[1]) They were raised under the care of Mr. Millshark.\nParkhurst ran away from the orphanage at age 12, adopted the name Charley, and assumed a masculine presentation. According to one account, Parkhurst soon met Ebenezer Balch, who had a livery stable in Providence, Rhode Island. He took what he thought was an orphaned boy under his care and returned to Rhode Island.[1] Treating Parkhurst like a son, Balch taught him to work as a stable hand and gradually with the horses. He developed an aptitude with horses, and Balch taught him to drive a coach, first with one, then four, and eventually six horses. Parkhurst worked for Balch for several years. He may have gotten to know James E. Birch, who was a younger stagecoach driver in Providence.\nIn 1848, the 21-year-old Birch and his close friend Frank Stevens went to California during the Gold Rush to seek their fortunes. Birch soon began a stagecoach service, starting as a driver with one wagon. He gradually consolidated several small stage lines into the California Stage Company.\nSeeking other opportunities as well, Parkhurst, in his late 30s, also left for California, sailing on the R.B. Forbes from Boston to Panama;[5] travelers had to cross the isthmus overland and pick up other ships on the west coast. In Panama, Parkhurst met John Morton, returning to San Francisco where he owned a drayage business; Morton recruited the driver to work for him.[6] Shortly after reaching California, Parkhurst lost the use of one eye after a kick from a horse, leading to his nickname of One Eyed Charley or Cockeyed Charley.\nLater Parkhurst went to work for Birch, where he developed a reputation as one of the finest stage coach drivers (a \"whip\") on the West Coast. This inspired another nickname for him, Six-Horse Charley. He was ranked with \"Foss, Hank Monk and George Gordon\" as one of the top drivers of the time.[7] Stagecoach drivers were also nicknamed \"Jehus,\" after a Biblical passage in Kings 9:20: \"\u2026and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.\"[1][8]\nAmong Parkhurst's routes in northern California were Stockton to Mariposa, \"the great stage route\" from San Jose to Oakland, and San Juan to Santa Cruz.[7] Stagecoach drivers carried mail as well as passengers, and had to deal with hold-up attempts, bad weather, and perilous, primitive trails. As historian Charles Outland described the era, \"It was a dangerous era in a dangerous country, where dangerous conditions were the norm.\"[9]\nSeeing that railroads were cutting into the stagecoach business, Parkhurst retired from driving some years later to Watsonville, California. For fifteen years he worked at farming and lumbering in the winter. He also raised chickens in Aptos.[7]\nHe later moved into a small cabin about six miles from Watsonville, and suffered from rheumatism in his later years. Parkhurst died there on December 18, 1879, due to tongue cancer.[7]\n\nPosthumous revelation[edit]\nAfter Parkhurst died in 1879, neighbors came to the cabin to lay out the body for burial and discovered that his body appeared to be female. Rheumatism and cancer of the tongue were listed as causes of death. In addition, the examining doctor established that Parkhurst had given birth at some time. A trunk in the house contained a baby's dress.[3] The LA Times reported, \"The discovery of her true sex became a local sensation,\"[2] and was soon carried by national newspapers.\nThe obituary about Parkhurst from the San Francisco Call was reprinted in The New York Times on January 9, 1880, so the extraordinary driving career and the post-mortem discovery of Parkhurst's sex received national coverage. The headline was: \"Thirty Years in Disguise: A Noted Old Californian Stage-Driver Discovered. After Death. To be a Woman.\"[7]\n\nHe was in his day one of the most dexterous and celebrated of the famous California drivers ranking with Foss, Hank Monk, and George Gordon, and it was an honor to be striven for to occupy the spare end of the driver's seat when the fearless Charley Parkhurst held the reins of a four-or six-in hand...\nLast Sunday [December 28, 1879], in a little cabin on the Moss Ranch, about six miles from Watsonville, Charley Parkhurst, the famous coachman, the fearless fighter, the industrious farmer and expert woodman died of the cancer on her tongue. She knew that death was approaching, but she did not relax the reticence of her later years other than to express a few wishes as to certain things to be done at her death. Then, when the hands of the kind friends who had ministered to her dying wants came to lay out the dead body of the adventurous Argonaut, a discovery was made that was literally astounding. Charley Parkhurst was a woman.[7]\nThe article noted how unusual it was that Parkhurst could have lived so long with no one discovering his biological sex, and to \"achieve distinction in an occupation above all professions calling for the best physical qualities of nerve, courage, coolness and endurance, and that she should add to them the almost romantic personal bravery that enables one to fight one's way through the ambush of an enemy...\" was seen to be almost beyond believing, but there was ample evidence to prove the case.[7]\n\n1868 vote[edit]\n A plaque on the fire station in Soquel, California, marks the site where Parkhurst might have voted.\nThe Santa Cruz Sentinel of October 17, 1868, lists Charles Darkey Parkhurst on the official poll list for the election of 1868. There is no record that Parkhurst actually cast a vote.[10] If he had voted, Parkhurst may have been the first female to vote in a presidential election in California. Local legend and Parkhurst's gravestone claims that Parkhurst was \"the first woman to vote in the U.S.\"[11]\n\nLegacy and honors[edit]\nThe fire station in Soquel, California, has a plaque reading:\nThe first ballot by a woman in an American presidential election was cast on this site November 3, 1868, by Charlotte (Charley) Parkhurst who masqueraded as a man for much of her life. She was a stagecoach driver in the mother lode country during the gold rush days and shot and killed at least one bandit. In her later years he drove a stagecoach in this area. She died in 1879. Not until then was she found to be female. She is buried in Watsonville at the pioneer cemetery.\nIn 1955, the Pajaro Valley Historical Association erected a monument at Parkhurst's grave, which reads:[12]\nCharley Darkey Parkhurst (1812\u20131879) Noted whip of the gold rush days drove stage over Mt. Madonna in early days of Valley. Last run San Juan to Santa Cruz. Death in cabin near the 7 mile house. Revealed 'one eyed Charley' a woman. First woman to vote in the U.S. November 3, 1868.\nIn 2007, the Santa Cruz County Redevelopment Agency oversaw the completion of the Parkhurst Terrace Apartments, named for the stagecoach driver and located a mile along the old stage route from the place of his death.[13][14]\nRepresentation in popular culture[edit]\nThe Autry National Center of Los Angeles had a series of programs and events, entitled Out West, from 2009 to 2010, that included exhibits, lectures, films and other material about homosexual, bisexual and transgender people's contributions to the Old West. Charley Parkhurst was one of the individuals featured in this series.[2]\nPam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan wrote a fictionalized biography of Charley Parkhurst's life for children, titled Riding Freedom (1999). It is illustrated by Brian Selznick.[15]\nFern J. Hill wrote a fictional memoir based on Parkhurst's life, Charley's Choice: The Life and Times of Charley Parkhurst (2008).[16]\nKaren Kondazian wrote a historical fiction novel, The Whip (2012), based loosely on the life of Charley Parkhurst.[17]\nOn March 13, 1958 during the sixth season of the television series Death Valley Days, the episode \"Cockeyed Charlie Parkhurst\" aired. It was loosely based on his life. Frank Gerstle played the role of Charley.\nJanice Holt Giles had Charlie Parkhurst as a character in the novel Six Horse Hitch, a historical fiction novel about stage coaching covering the period from 1859 to 1869. Published 1969 by Houghton Mifflin company.\nThere seems to be a brief reference to Parkhurst in a line from Django Unchained around 1 hour and 1 minute in. King describes how Django could act as a slave-fighting expert to help him avoid suspicion and danger. Comes Django's reply: \"They call that [a] One-Eyed Charley.\" The comedic parallel to a knowing contemporary audience is apparently that social mis-interpretations can still be used to one's advantage. This reading of the line presents an anachronism, however, because Parkhurst's revelatory obituary was not published till after his death in 1879, whereas the line is delivered in a (likely fictional/alternate) 1858.\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f Kathi Bristow, \"Those Daring Stage Drivers\", 2008, California Dept. of Parks and Recreation, accessed 13 August 2014\n\n^ a b c d Ng, David (December 15, 2009). \"'Out West' at the Autry examines the history of homosexuals and transgender people in the Old West\".

[6]Since coming out as a trans woman in 2013, she has become one of the most recognisable transgender models in the world.[7]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 Further reading\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nPeji\u0107 was born in Tuzla, Yugoslavia (now part of Bosnia and Herzegovina), and has one older brother, Igor. Her mother, Jadranka Savi\u0107,[8] is a Bosnian Serb, and her father, Vlado Peji\u0107, is a Bosnian Croat. The couple divorced shortly after Peji\u0107's birth. During the Bosnian War, Peji\u0107 and Igor fled to Serbia with their mother and grandmother, settling in a refugee camp near Belgrade. After the refugee camp, the family settled in the Vojska village near Svilajnac.[9]\nFollowing the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Peji\u0107's mother felt unsafe and decided to initiate the process of emigration to Australia. In 2000, the family moved to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, as political refugees when Peji\u0107 was eight years old.[10][3]\nWhile attending high school at University High, Peji\u0107 was described as being \"academically brilliant\".[11]\n\nCareer[edit]\nPeji\u0107 was scouted as a model just before her 17th birthday while working at McDonald's,[12] though she has also said in an interview that she was scouted at a swimming pool while still in high school in Melbourne.[13]\nPeji\u0107 was initially notable for modelling both masculine and feminine clothing. In the Paris fashion shows of January 2011, Peji\u0107 walked both the men's and women's shows for Jean-Paul Gaultier and the men's shows for Marc Jacobs. In May 2011, her magazine cover for the New York-based magazine Dossier Journal\u2014in which Peji\u0107, with long blond locks in curlers, is pictured taking off a white shirt \u2014was ruled too risqu\u00e9 by US bookstores Barnes & Noble and Borders, which covered the image with an opaque sleeve.[14] Concerns were expressed that customers would read Peji\u0107, who at the time was presenting as gender fluid, as a topless woman.[15]\nAt the Stylenite in July 2011, Peji\u0107 appeared on the catwalk both in masculine and feminine clothes from Michalsky.[16] The following year, she modeled bridal creations by Spanish designer Rosa Clara at Barcelona's Bridal Week 2013.[17]\nPeji\u0107 ranked number 18 on Models.com's Top 50 Models list in 2011,[3] was named one of Out's Most Compelling People,[3] and was ranked number 98 in FHM magazine's 100 Sexiest Women in the World 2011,[18] an award that was criticised for its hostile tone to transgender individuals, especially transgender women; the magazine referred to Peji\u0107 as a \"thing\", commenting, \"Pass the sick bucket.\"[19] FHM subsequently removed the copy accompanying Peji\u0107's entry and posted an apology.[20]\nPeji\u0107 has appeared on the covers of international editions of Elle, Marie Claire, Harper's Bazaar, L'Officiel, Fashion and GQ. Andreja has also appeared in editorials for fashion publications including Vogue, Elle, I-D, Dazed and Confused, Love, Allure, Purple and Num\u00e9ro.[21]\nOn 6 August 2012, Peji\u0107 appeared as a guest judge on Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model.[22] The following year, Peji\u0107 appeared alongside Iselin Steiro, Saskia de Brauw, Tilda Swinton and David Bowie in the video for Bowie's 2013 single \"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\".[23] In late 2013, she made her acting debut playing Radu the Beautiful in the short-lived Turkish television series Fatih, which is based on the life of Mehmed the Conqueror.[citation needed]\nPeji\u0107 became the first openly transgender model profiled by Vogue, in its May 2015 issue, and also became the first-ever trans woman to sign a cosmetics contract. In 2016, Peji\u0107 was awarded \"Best International Female Model\" by GQ Portugal and the following year she made history by becoming the first transgender woman to appear on the cover of GQ.[24][25][26] Peji\u0107 made her major film debut in the 2018 crime thriller film The Girl in the Spider's Web.[27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn late 2013, Peji\u0107 underwent sex reassignment surgery. In September 2014, Peji\u0107 announced plans on the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform to create a film about her reassignment surgery and life as a woman. Peji\u0107 started off with a projected goal of $40,000, ultimately exceeding the target funding goal.[28][29] Peji\u0107 had previously dated Are You the One? cast member Remy Duran.[30]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of androgynous people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Schneier, Matthew (5 September 2014). \"A Model's Life, Chapter 2\".

The rhizomes are wide-spreading, fleshy, and bear fibrous roots. The leaves can be 4\u20139\u00a0cm (1.6\u20133.5\u00a0in) long and 1.5\u20134\u00a0cm (0.59\u20131.57\u00a0in) broad. They are dark green with reddish veins, and they have an acute apex and coarsely toothed margins. The leaves and stems are usually slightly fuzzy. The flowers are purple, 6\u20138\u00a0mm (0.24\u20130.31\u00a0in) long, with a four-lobed corolla about 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) diameter; they are produced in whorls (verticillasters) around the stem, forming thick, blunt spikes. Flowering season lasts from mid- to late summer. The chromosome number is variable, with 2n counts of 66, 72, 84, and 120 recorded.[13][14][15] Peppermint is a fast-growing plant; once it sprouts, it spreads very quickly.\n\nEcology[edit]\nPeppermint typically occurs in moist habitats, including stream sides and drainage ditches. Being a hybrid, it is usually sterile, producing no seeds and reproducing only vegetatively, spreading by its runners. If placed, it can grow almost anywhere.[5][15]\nOutside of its native range, areas where peppermint was formerly grown for oil often have an abundance of feral plants, and it is considered invasive in Australia, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, New Zealand,[16] and the United States[17] in the Great Lakes region, noted since 1843.[18]\n\nCultivation[edit]\n Peppermint grown in a pot outside a house\nPeppermint generally grows best in moist, shaded locations, and expands by underground rhizomes. Young shoots are taken from old stocks and dibbled into the ground about 1.5 feet apart.  They grow quickly and cover the ground with runners if it is permanently moist.  For the home gardener, it is often grown in containers to restrict rapid spreading. It grows best with a good supply of water, without being water-logged, and planted in areas with part-sun to shade.\nThe leaves and flowering tops are used; they are collected as soon as the flowers begin to open and can be dried. The wild form of the plant is less suitable for this purpose, with cultivated plants having been selected for more and better oil content. They may be allowed to lie and wilt a little before distillation, or they may be taken directly to the still.\n\nCultivars[edit]\nA number of cultivars have been selected for garden use:\n\nMentha \u00d7 piperita 'Candymint'. Stems reddish.[19]\nMentha \u00d7 piperita 'Chocolate Mint'. Flowers open from bottom up; reminiscent of flavour in Andes Chocolate Mints, a popular confection.[20][21][22]\nMentha \u00d7 piperita 'Citrata'. Includes a number of varieties including Eau De Cologne Mint,[23] Grapefruit Mint, Lemon Mint,[24] and Orange Mint. Leaves aromatic, hairless.\nMentha \u00d7 piperita 'Crispa'. Leaves wrinkled.[25]\nMentha \u00d7 piperita 'Lavender Mint'.[26]\nMentha \u00d7 piperita 'Lime Mint'. Foliage lime-scented.[27][28]\nMentha \u00d7 piperita 'Variegata'. Leaves mottled green and pale yellow.[29]\nCommercial cultivars may include\n\nDulgo pole[30]\nZefir[30]\nBulgarian population #2[30]\nClone 11-6-22[30]\nClone 80-121-33[30]\nMitcham Digne 38[31]\nMitcham Ribecourt 19[31]\nTodd's#x2019[31]\nTodd's Mitcham, a verticillium wilt-resistant cultivar produced from a breeding and test program of atomic gardening at Brookhaven National Laboratory from the mid-1950s\nProduction[edit]\nIn 2014, world production of peppermint was 92,296 tonnes, led by Morocco with 92% of the world total reported by FAOSTAT of the United Nations.[32] Argentina accounted for 8% of the world total.[32]\nIn the United States, Oregon and Washington produce most of the country's peppermint,[33] the leaves of which are processed for the essential oil to produce flavorings mainly for chewing gum and toothpaste.[34]\n\nChemical constituents[edit]\nPeppermint has a high menthol content.  The oil also contains menthone and carboxyl esters, particularly menthyl acetate.[35] Dried peppermint typically has 0.3\u20130.4% of volatile oil containing menthol (7\u201348%), menthone (20\u201346%), menthyl acetate (3\u201310%), menthofuran (1\u201317%) and 1,8-cineol (3\u20136%).  Peppermint oil also contains small amounts of many additional compounds including limonene, pulegone, caryophyllene and pinene.[36]\nPeppermint contains terpenoids and flavonoids such as eriocitrin, hesperidin, and kaempferol 7-O-rutinoside.[37]\n\nOil[edit]\n Peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) essential oil\nPeppermint oil has a high concentration of natural pesticides, mainly pulegone (found mainly in Mentha arvensis var. piperascens  cornmint, field mint, Japanese mint, and to a lesser extent (6,530 ppm) in Mentha \u00d7 piperita subsp. notho[38]) and menthone.[39] It is known to repel some pest insects, including mosquitos, and has uses in organic gardening. It is also widely used to repel rodents.[40][41][42][43]\nThe chemical composition of the essential oil from peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita L.) was analyzed by GC/FID and GC-MS. The main constituents were menthol (40.7%) and menthone (23.4%). Further components were (\u00b1)-menthyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, limonene, beta-pinene and beta-caryophyllene.[44]\n\nResearch and health effects[edit]\nPeppermint oil is under preliminary research for its potential as a short-term treatment for irritable bowel syndrome,[45][46] and has supposed uses in traditional medicine for minor ailments.[47] Peppermint oil and leaves have a cooling effect when used topically for muscle pain, nerve pain, relief from itching, or as a fragrance.[47][48] High oral doses of peppermint oil (500\u00a0mg) can cause mucosal irritation and mimic heartburn.[47][48]\n\nCulinary and other uses[edit]\nFresh or dried peppermint leaves are often used alone in peppermint tea or with other herbs in herbal teas (tisanes, infusions). Peppermint is used for flavouring ice cream, candy, fruit preserves, alcoholic beverages, chewing gum, toothpaste, and some shampoos, soaps and skin care products.[33][34]\nMenthol activates cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin and mucosal tissues, and is the primary source of the cooling sensation that follows the topical application of peppermint oil.[49]\n\n\n\n\n\nCandy canes are one of the most common peppermint-flavored candies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMentha \u00d7 piperita hybrid known as \u201cchocolate mint\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeze-dried leaves\n\n\n\n\nPeppermint oil is also used in construction and plumbing to test for the tightness of pipes and disclose leaks by its odor.[50]\n\nSafety[edit]\nMedicinal uses of peppermint have not been approved as effective or safe by the US Food and Drug Administration.[51]  With caution that the concentration of the peppermint constituent pulegone should not exceed more than 1% (140\u00a0mg), peppermint preparations are considered safe by the European Medicines Agency when used in topical formulations for adult subjects.[52][53] Diluted peppermint essential oil is safe for oral intake when only a few drops are used.[47][52]\nAlthough peppermint is commonly available as a herbal supplement, there are no established, consistent manufacturing standards for it, and some peppermint products may be contaminated with toxic metals or other substituted compounds.[51] Skin rashes, irritation, or an allergic reaction may result from applying peppermint oil to the skin,[51] and its use on the face or chest of young children may cause side effects if the oil menthol is inhaled.[47][52] A common side effect from oral intake of peppermint oil or capsules is heartburn.[51] Oral use of peppermint products may have adverse effects when used with iron supplements, cyclosporine, medicines for heart conditions or high blood pressure, or medicines to decrease stomach acid.[51]\n\nStandardization[edit]\nISO 676:1995 - contains the information about the nomenclature of the variety and cultivars[54]\nISO 5563:1984 - a specification for its dried leaves of Mentha piperita Linnaeus[55]\nPeppermint oil - ISO 856:2006[56]\nSee also[edit]\n\nEssential oil\nMenthol\nPeppermint extract\nPulegone\nSpearmint (Mentha spicata)\nWatermint\nEucalyptus\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^  (PDF).

artist under her own imprint, BunHead Records.\nPetras began recording music as a teenager, releasing her debut extended play One Piece of Tape in 2011. She independently released her debut single in 2017, \"I Don't Want It at All\", which went on to top several viral music charts on Spotify.[2] The song was followed by Billboard-charting singles \"Feeling of Falling\" (with Cheat Codes), \"Heart to Break\", and \"1, 2, 3 Dayz Up\" (featuring Sophie).\nFollowing her early success, Petras released a collection of digital singles which would later comprise her unofficial body of work known as Era 1. Petras released her debut album, Clarity, on 28 June 2019. The record was preceded with a nine-week-long promotional campaign, during which Petras released one single per week with an accompanying visual video. Clarity received acclaim from music critics, reached number seven on the Heatseekers Chart and number 26 on the Independent Albums chart. Following this, Petras released a Halloween-themed album Turn Off the Light in October 2019. In 2020, Petras saw international chart success with her singles \"Malibu\" and \"Broken Glass\", the latter being a collaboration with Kygo.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 2008\u20132014: Career beginnings\n2.2 2017\u20132019: Breakthrough with Era 1\n2.3 2019\u20132020: Clarity and Turn Off the Light\n\n\n3 Artistry\n4 Public image\n5 Awards and nominations\n6 Discography\n7 Tours\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nKim Petras was born in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.[3][4] While she was assigned male at birth, her parents said that from the age of two, Petras knew she was a girl. After it became clear it was \"not just a phase\", her parents sought professional help and found the head of the psychiatric unit at Frankfurt Hospital, Dr. Bernd Meyenburg.[5]\nIn 2006, Petras, then aged 13, appeared on a German television current affairs show in which she discussed her medical gender transition. At age 14, Petras appeared in a documentary and a talk show,[6][7] in a push to get permission for early gender confirmation surgery at age 16, before the minimum age of 18 in Germany. These appearances resulted in international media coverage of her transition, touting her as the \"world's youngest transsexual\". [8] This assertion is inaccurate, as gender dysphoria is often diagnosed in childhood and (social) transition by younger children is not uncommon. However, Petras may have been one of the youngest people at that time to undergo transgender hormone therapy.\nIn September 2007, she was a model for a German chain of hair salons.[9] Petras announced in November 2008 that she had completed her gender confirmation surgery at 16 years old.[10] The Daily Telegraph claimed Petras was the youngest person in the world to have had that surgery at the time. About her surgery, Petras stated \"I was asked if I feel like a woman now \u2013 but the truth is I have always felt like a woman \u2013 I just ended up in the wrong body\".[11]\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed, Petras stated that the first song she ever wrote was \"about this dude in second grade who didn't like me back\".[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\n2008\u20132014: Career beginnings[edit]\n Kim Petras performing in 2012.\nBetween 2008 and 2009, Petras released a string of singles under Joyce Records: \"Fade Away\" (2008), \"Last Forever\" (2009), \"Die for You\" (2009), and \"Boomerang\" (2009). In 2009, Petras was featured on \"Taste\" by Sobertruth and in 2011 she was featured on \"Magnetic\". Later in 2011, Petras released her debut extended play, One Piece of Tape, under the imprint Bionic Ballroom.\nIn 2013, Petras was featured on two singles named \"Flight to Paris\" and \"Hearbeat\" by German DJ Klaas. Throughout the next few years, Petras worked with producers including The Stereotypes, C.J. Abraham, Stephen Dresser, Johan \u201cJones\u201d Wetterberg, Edward Ellis, and Aaron Joseph on a music career, releasing demos on her SoundCloud page, including one titled \"STFU\".[13] For her contributions to social media, Petras was ranked at number 19 on Billboard's Artist Chart, listing developing artists, in July 2013.[14] In 2015, Petras appeared on \"You\" by Isaac Phase for his album, Phase 00001.\n\n2017\u20132019: Breakthrough with Era 1[edit]\n Petras performing at Capital Pride in 2018.\nIn August 2017, Petras released her debut single \"I Don't Want It at All\",[15] The song went on to reach the Spotify Global Viral chart.[16] The accompanying music video for the song premiered in October on Vevo, and features a cameo appearance by Paris Hilton.[17][18] In the same month, Petras was picked by Spotify to be one of the four artists named as a RISE Artist, a \"program designed to identify and break the next wave of music superstars.\"[19] During the end of 2017, Petras was dubbed \"most likely to dominate the pop charts\" by Paper magazine,[20] and appeared on Charli XCX's mixtape Pop 2 (2017) for the track \"Unlock It\" alongside Jay Park.\nIn January 2018, the Nicholas Harwood-directed video for Petras' single \"Faded\", which features Lil Aaron, premiered on Noisey,[21] That same month, she appeared in the January issue of Galore.[2] Petras released the breakup-inspired \"Heart to Break\" in February, to commemorate Valentine's Day.[22] The song was given its radio debut on BBC Radio 1 on 19 February.[23] Bryan Kress of Billboard noted how while the single is \"still keeping Petras' upbeat, unabashed pop sound... [it] ventures into new territory for the songwriter.\"[22] On the 21st of that same month, Petras released her online singles-bundle, Spotify Singles, exclusively through the service under BunHead Records, Petras' own label. It consisted of live renditions of \"Hills\" and The Killers' \"Human\", as performed at their NYC Studio.[24]\n\n Petras and Aaron Joseph on The Clarity Tour in 2019.\nOn 1 October 2018, Petras released Turn Off the Light, Vol. 1, a Halloween-themed extended play. The project was seen as a departure from Petras' typical sound, and features a guest appearance from the horror hostess character Elvira.[25] Afterwards, Petras announced plans to release a single a month as a lead up to her debut album.[2] She was featured on Cheat Codes' song \"Feeling of Falling\" in November 2018.[26] Petras has been credited with composing the song \"Young & Wild\" on Twice's 6th EP, Yes or Yes.[27]\nIn February 2019, Petras released three singles titled \"1,2,3 Dayz Up\" featuring Sophie, \"If U Think About Me...\", and \"Homework\" featuring Lil Aaron.[28] Petras has not publicly expressed plans to release an album with any of her digital singles from 2016 until early 2019, but has referred to this release period as Era 1 on multiple occasions.[29]\n\n2019\u20132020: Clarity and Turn Off the Light[edit]\nPetras released her debut album, Clarity, on 28 June 2019. Throughout May and June, Petras released one song a week as a lead-up to the album's release.[30] In June, Petras embarked on the 24-stop Broken Tour across North America and Europe.[31] Petras was featured on the covers of Galore and Notion magazines that same month. The album was preceded by promotional singles including \"All I Do Is Cry\" and \"Sweet Spot\" and was accompanied by the lead single, \"Icy\", on its release date. Petras made a series of appearances on podcasts and web series to promote the record, including an interview on the Zach Sang Show.[32]\nIn August, Petras announced that there would be a limited edition vinyl pressing of Turn Off the Light, Vol. 1 through Urban Outfitters. Petras has announced that Turn Off the Light, Vol. 2 will be released exactly a year after the first part. On 1 October 2019, Petras' second studio album Turn Off the Light was released. The album features songs from Vol. 1 and also nine new tracks.[33] On 11 February 2020, she released the single \"Reminds Me\". That same month, she announced that she would be the supporting act on the European leg of Camila Cabello's The Romance Tour,[34] which was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. \nOn 7 May, Petras released the single \"Malibu\" as the lead single off of her debut studio album. Kim Petras breaks down the 3-year creation of her new single 'Malibu' and teases her colorful debut album: 'I don't feel heartbroken anymore'. She has described the song as \"escapist pop\" and commented that \"This is really a new start, the beginning of a new chapter and a new album cycle,\" she says. \"I don't feel heartbroken anymore. I don't feel caught up in that. I just want to make music that makes me want to dance and makes me forget about all the stupid stuff right now.\"[citation needed] The song was promoted by a performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and charted in the United Kingdom and Scotland. Petras was later featured on the song \"Broken Glass\" by Kygo, from his album Golden Hour, released 29 May.[35] The song became Petras' commercial breakthrough, charting in various European countries as well as Canada.\nOn October 23, 2020, Petras announced that Turn Off the Light, Vol. 3 will be released some time in 2021 \"when [she] can perform it live\".[36] She also released a new song \"Party Till I Die\", adding that this could be considered Turn Off the Light, Vol. 2.1. Petras' song \"Reminds Me\" was sampled by The Kid Laroi for his song \"Reminds Me of You\", a collaboration with Juice WRLD released on the first anniversary of his death.[37]\n\nArtistry[edit]\nKim Petras is a pop artist who also makes electronic dance music (EDM), dance-pop and electropop.[3][38] She credits the late-1990s/early-2000s pop scene[39] and 1980s Italo disco[20] as the primary basis for her sound. Petras' inspirations include Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Beyonc\u00e9, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, Madonna and Spice Girls,[40][41][39] as well as Boy George, Debbie Harry, Queen, Freddie Mercury,[13] Judy Garland, Baby E, Lil Aaron, and Liz Y2K.[2] In an interview, Petras stated that \"To me, pop music is an escape from my problems. I can put on my headphones and listen to it for three and a half minutes to forget about everything that's bothering me. It's always been that way for me. I feel like pop definitely saved my life in so many ways.\"[42]\nOn her songwriting, Petras told Noisey that \"there's something about making a song that everybody can sing and remember, and when you listen to it the first time you already know the words by the second chorus, like you've always known the song. I'm obsessed with that idea.\"[39] She commented on themes, stating \"I write about boys, heartbreak, sex, having fun and the things that I go through.\"[2]\n\nPublic image[edit]\nFollowing her debut, Petras was dubbed as \"the new princess of pop\" by Nasty Galaxy.[13] This title was further repeated by publications including Billboard,[43] ABC News,[44] V,[45] and Idolator.[46]\nFollowing the release of her debut album Clarity (2019), many reviewers praised the record but criticized her involvement with Dr. Luke, who had been accused of sexually and verbally assaulting American singer-songwriter Kesha in 2015.[47][48][49][50] To avoid controversy, Petras has refrained from mentioning him in interviews, and has not given Dr. Luke a formal production credit on her album.[51]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\nAwards\nWork\nCategory\nResult\nRef.\n\n\n2017\n\nGay Music Chart Awards\n\n\"I Don't Want It at All\"\n\nBest Transgender Music Video\n\nNominated\n\n[52]\n\n\nHerself\n\nBest Revelation\n\nNominated\n\n\n2019\n\nRober Awards Music Prize\n\n\"1, 2, 3 Dayz Up\"\n\nBest Guilty Pleasure\n\nNominated\n\n[53]\n\n\n2020\n\nQueerty Awards\n\nHerself\n\nBadass\n\nNominated\n\n[54]\n\n\n\"Sweet Spot\"\n\nAnthem\n\nNominated\n\n[55]\n\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nClarity\n\nOutstanding Music Artist\n\nNominated\n\n[56]\n\n\nWOWIE Awards\n\nMalibu\n\nOutstanding Song\n\nPending\n\n[57]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nMain article: Kim Petras discography\nClarity (2019)[30]\nTurn Off the Light (2019)\nTours[edit]\nMain article: List of Kim Petras live performances\nHeadlining\nThe Broken Tour (2019)\nThe Clarity Tour (2019\u201320)\nSupporting\nThe Bloom Tour (Troye Sivan) (2018)\nThe Romance Tour (Camila Cabello) (2021)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Kim Petras (@kimpetras) | Twitter\". twitter.com.

Pollack is involved in the women's spirituality movement.\n\nContents\n\n1 Tarot reading\n2 Comics\n3 Fiction\n4 Nonfiction\n5 Influences\n6 Teaching\n7 Cancer\n8 Degrees, awards, and memberships\n9 Published works\n\n9.1 Non-fiction books\n9.2 Novels\n9.3 Collections\n9.4 Anthologies\n9.5 Short fiction\n9.6 Poetry\n9.7 Essays\n9.8 Forthcoming books\n9.9 Reviews\n9.10 Comics\n\n\n10 References\n11 External links\n\n\nTarot reading[edit]\nPollack has written Salvador Dali's Tarot, a book-length exposition of Salvador Dali's Tarot deck, comprising a full-page color plate for each card, with her commentary on the facing page.[1] Pollack's work 78 Degrees of Wisdom on Tarot reading is commonly referenced by Tarot readers.[2] She has created her own Tarot deck, Shining Woman Tarot (later Shining Tribe Tarot).[3] She also aided in the creation of the Vertigo Tarot Deck with illustrator Dave McKean and author Neil Gaiman, and she wrote a book to accompany it.[4]\n\nComics[edit]\nPollack, known for her run of issues 64\u201387 (1993-1995) on the comic book Doom Patrol, on DC Comics' Vertigo imprint,[5] a continuation of a 1960s comic which had recently become a cult favorite under Grant Morrison. She took over the series in 1993 after meeting editor Tom Peyer at a party, telling him it was the only monthly comic book she would want to write at the time, and sending him a sample script. Towards the end of Morrison's run Pollack began writing monthly \"letters to the editor\" in what she describes as a \"gee-whiz fangirl\" voice asking to take over the book when Morrison was finished. In the final letter she claims that she had already told her mother that she had been given the job. Peyer then used that response to that letter to officially announce that Pollack was, in fact, taking over the book. As a result of these letters being printed in the letter column of Doom Patrol issues some people seem to believe that the letters are the way she actually got the job.[6]\nDuring her tenure Pollack dealt with such rarely addressed comic-book topics as menstruation, sexual identity, and transsexuality. Pollack's run ended two years later, with the book's cancellation.\nIn addition to Doom Patrol, Pollack has written issues of the Vertigo Visions anthology featuring Brother Power the Geek (1993) and Tomahawk (1998), the first 11 issues of the fourth volume of New Gods (1995), and the five issue limited series Time Breakers (1996) for the short lived Helix imprint.\nAuthor Neil Gaiman has sometimes consulted Rachel Pollack on the tarot for his stories.[7]\nIn 2019 it was announced that Pollack was reuniting with Doom Patrol artist Richard Case and letterer John Workman to create a short story\u2014titled \"Snake Song\"\u2014for the Kickstarter funded \"music themed horror anthology\" Dead Beats.[8][9]\n\nFiction[edit]\nThree of Pollack's novels have won or been nominated for major awards in the science fiction and fantasy field: Unquenchable Fire won the 1989 Arthur C. Clarke Award; Godmother Night won the 1997 World Fantasy Award, was shortlisted for the James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was nominated for a Lambda Award; Temporary Agency was nominated for the 1995 Nebula Award and the Mythopoeic Award, and shortlisted for the Tiptree.[10]\nHer magical realism[11] novels explore worlds imbued with elements pulled from a number of traditions, faiths, and religions. Several of her novels are set in an alternative reality that resembles modern America, but an America of Bright Beings, where magic and ritual, religion and thaumaturgy are the norms.[12]\n\nNonfiction[edit]\nHer book The Body Of The Goddess is an exploration of the history of the Goddess. Rachel Pollack uses the image of the Goddess in many of her works.\n\nInfluences[edit]\nPollack is Jewish,[13] and has frequently written about the Kabbalah, most notably in The Kabbalah Tree.[14]\nPollack is a transsexual woman and has written frequently on transgender issues.[15][16] In Doom Patrol she introduced Coagula, a transsexual character. She has also written several essays on transsexualism, attacking the notion that it is a \"sickness,\" [17] instead saying that it is a passion. She has emphasized the revelatory aspects of transsexualism, saying that \"the trance-sexual [sic] woman sacrifices her social identity as a male, her personal history, and finally the very shape of her body to a knowledge, a desire, which overpowers all rational understanding and proof.\" [18]\nA Secret Woman features a police detective who is transgender and Jewish. The detective utters the prayer, \"Blessed art thou oh G-d who made me not a woman. Double blessed is Doctor Green who has.\"[19] Rachel Pollack created the characters known as 'the bandage people' for her Doom Patrol run. The bandage people are 'sexually remaindered spirits' who died in sexual accidents. The initials srs came from the medical term 'sex reassignment surgery'.  Rachel wrote the essay \"The Transsexual Book of The Dead\" for the anthology Phallus Palace. This article is concerning trans men.\nFairy tales such as the Brothers Grimm have influenced many of Pollack's writings. Her new book, Tarot of Perfection, is a book of fairy tales based on the tarot.\n\nTeaching[edit]\nFor nearly 20 years Pollack has been teaching seminars with Tarot author Mary K. Greer at the Omega Institute, in Rhinebeck, New York.[20] She has also done seminars for several years in California in conjunction with Greer, and she co-presented a breakthrough seminar with Tarot author Johanna Gargiulo-Sherman on Tarot and psychic ability, using her own Shining Tribe Tarot and Gargulio-Sherman's Sacred Rose Tarot.[20] Pollack is also a popular lecturer at Tarot seminars and symposiums such as LATS (Los Angeles Tarot Symposium), BATS (Bay Area Tarot Symposium), and the Readers Studio.[20] Pollack currently teaches creative writing at Goddard College. Her most recent work is included in the anthology called Interfictions: An Anthology of Interstitial Writing edited by Theodora Goss. Pollack has taught English at State University of New York.\n\nCancer[edit]\nIn May 2015, Pollack was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. By late summer the cancer had responded to treatment and was in remission.[citation needed]\n\nDegrees, awards, and memberships[edit]\n1997 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel winner for Godmother Night[21]\n1994 Nebula Award for Best Novel nominee for Temporary Agency\n1989 Arthur C.

Prenner was assigned female at birth, but from a young age identified as male and began to transition to a male appearance as a teenager.[Notes 1] Prenner's family were not well-off and moved often in his childhood, before settling in Slovenj Gradec. Because of a lack of funds, Prenner often worked and had to change schools. Despite these difficulties, he graduated from high school in 1930 and immediately entered law school at the University of King Alexander I. He began publishing about this time and earned a living by tutoring other students and selling his writing. He published several short stories and novels including the first Slovenian detective story.\nCompleting a doctorate in 1941, Prenner opened a law practice and earned a reputation for defending political prisoners and those accused of crimes against the state. Now living as a male, his combative manner in the courtroom and strong sense of judicial independence led to his being imprisoned several times by the communist regime. After being expelled from the Slovene Writers' Association, he was unable to publish until shortly before his death. Prenner was released from prison in 1950 and began a campaign to have his law license restored. From 1954, he was allowed to practice again and was known for rarely losing a case. He was asked in 1968 to give the speech for the Bar Association's centennial celebrations and in 1970 was appointed as the permanent German-language court interpreter for Slovenia.\nPrenner died from breast cancer in 1977. Changes in social conventions and celebrations for the hundredth anniversary of his birth have led to a re-examination of his life in biographies and documentaries, as well as publication of some of his previously unpublished autobiographical novels.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education (1906\u20131930)\n2 University studies and early literary career (1929\u20131939)\n3 Legal career, activism, and imprisonment (1939\u20131954)\n4 Later life (1954\u20131976)\n5 Death and legacy\n6 Selected works\n7 Notes\n8 References\n\n8.1 Citations\n8.2 Bibliography\n\n\n\n\nEarly life and education (1906\u20131930)[edit]\nLjuba Prenner was born Amalia Marija Ursula Prenner on 19 June 1906, in Fara, near Prevalje, in the Slovene province of Carinthia, Austria-Hungary, to Marija \u010cer\u010de and Josef Prenner.[3][9][10] His father was a German carpenter and gunsmith from Ko\u010devje. His mother was a Slovene, the daughter of a winemaker and cobbler. Though his father was not fluent in Slovene and his mother spoke no German, Prenner from a young age, spoke both languages.[3] He took on the name Ljuba, discarding his baptismal name, as soon as he recognized his ability to think independently.[10] He had a younger sister, Josipina, and an older half-brother, Ivan \u010cer\u010de, an illegitimate child conceived before his mother had married.[3][11]\nPrenner's family was not well-off and moved often because of the father's work. That meant that he completed first grade in Ru\u0161e, where the family moved in 1910, and the next three grades in Slovenj Gradec.[3][12] Education was barred to most women at the time, as traditional Christian values required that they be subordinate and confined to the domestic sphere.[5][13] High schools did not admit girls and a university education was forbidden without a secondary education diploma.[5] At the end of World War I, Slovenia became part of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.[14] Women created organizations and demanded equality in the new country, including the right to vote, earn a living, and have an education.[15] It was not until 1929 that coeducational compulsory education for eight grades was enacted in the country, which in that year, became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.[16] 1929 was also the first year that women were allowed to participate in the legal profession in Slovenia.[17]\n\n Slovenj Gradec, known as Windischgraz, around the time the Prenners moved there\nIn 1919, Prenner enrolled in the private Ptuj State Gymnasium and was able to finish three years, before a lack of funds forced him to return home. He privately studied his fourth year courses in Celje and then returned to Ptuj to take the examination to certify completion of the grade.[3][18] As a teenager, Prenner first cut his hair short and began transitioning his appearance from female to male.[5] He also began attending theater events and literary evenings which exposed him to Slovenian culture and instilled a desire to continue his education. Short of funds, he took a position as a typist in a law firm in Slovenj Gradec, increasing his savings for the next two years. He then moved to Belgrade and enrolled in the First Women's Realgymnasium. He completed his fifth and sixth years of high school while working as a hospital attendant and a clerk for a plumbing company. Again he exhausted his funds and returned home, completing the remaining two years of high school through private study.[3][19] In 1930, he successfully passed the Matura matriculation at the Ljubljana Lyceum,[20] having obtained proficiency in English, French, German, and Italian.[21]\n\nUniversity studies and early literary career (1929\u20131939)[edit]\nPrenner immediately enrolled in law school at the University of King Alexander I.[20] Though he tutored many of his colleagues, he failed almost every examination at the first attempt, whereas those he taught passed.[5] It took him six years to earn his law degree because of the discriminatory practices he encountered and his need to work.[5][20] In addition to tutoring, he published short stories to earn money.[20] Between 1936 and 1937, he completed his legal internship with Josip Lavri\u010d in Slovenj Gradec, but decided to move permanently to Ljubljana to facilitate studying for a doctorate.[3][22]\n\n Neznani storilec (The Unknown Perpetrator), first Slovenian crime novel, by Ljuba Prenner\nDespite studying to become a lawyer, Prenner hoped to become a writer. His short stories like Trojica (1929) and \u017divljenje za hrbtom (1936), and novels such as Pohorska vigred v \u010dasopisu Jutro (1930\u201331) and Mejniki ali kronika malega sveta v reviji \u017denski svet (1936\u201338), abandoned the prevailing Socialist realism model, popular for literary works at the time. Rather than an ideologically motivated text, Prenner's works were characterized by the human ability to adapt to life with faith, humor, and irony.[5] He wrote many situational comedies using satire and wit to explore people and their lives.[23] Almost all the works are set in a small town, feature a lawyer, and contain autobiographical elements[24] with a typically male protagonist.[6] These literary efforts were seen as focused too much on entertainment rather than enlightenment. As a result, most of them were never published. In 1939, he published the first crime novel in Slovenia, Neznani storilec (The Unknown Perpetrator).[5] That year, he was admitted to membership in the Slovene Writers' Association.[10]\nPrenner worked in two different law firms and successfully completed his graduate studies in 1941.[22] That year, Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers of Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, and Italy, who partitioned the country. Slovenia was split in half, with Italy taking the western portion and Germany taking the eastern part.[25] The following year, he passed his bar examination, but had to resort to subterfuge to obtain his license.[26] As a result of partition, Italy controlled Ljubljana[27] and refused to issue a license to anyone born in the German section of the country. Prenner applied for a license stating that he had been born in Fara. The Italians assumed he meant Fara, Kostel, near his father's birthplace in Ko\u010devje, and issued him a license.[3][26]\n\nLegal career, activism, and imprisonment (1939\u20131954)[edit]\nNow increasingly living as a male, during his doctorate studies Prenner joined the Osvobodilna fronta (Liberation Front, OF), an anti-fascist civil resistance movement. His apartment was used for meetings and as a dropbox for partisan communiques. He housed comrades who needed shelter for a night and provided legal advice or defense to detainees and prisoners.[26] As he refused to join the communist party on account of their methods rather than their ideology, party leaders began to watch him as a potential opponent.[3] Prenner opened a private law practice in 1943,[26] and gained a reputation for his work during the war with political prisoners. In one scheme, he filed false paperwork with the authorities claiming that the judgments of the Italian courts were invalid after Italy capitulated to the Allies. He secured the freedom of many Slovenes before the Germans realized their error and arrested him in 1944. He escaped imprisonment, but had to pay a large fine.[3][28]\nWhen the war ended, Prenner was one of only 13 lawyers allowed to continue practicing by the communist government.[3][29] In 1946, he was assigned to represent the partisan Ton\u010dko Vidic, who had been sentenced to death for treason. Prenner thought that the conviction was based on flimsy evidence and found witnesses who were able to prove that the charges were false. He demanded a retrial, earning an acquittal for his client. In the aftermath of the trial, he and the prosecutor, whose weak case he had exposed, engaged in a physical altercation, which resulted in Prenner being fined by the disciplinary court.[3][30] He became known as a lawyer who rarely lost a case, using unyielding determination and legal acumen.[10] Among those he represented who were accused of collaborating with the Italian occupation authorities were Juro Adle\u0161i\u010d, former mayor of Ljubljana; the owner of the cinema in Ljubljana; and Slovenes who had participated with Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 in resistance during the war.[30]\nPrenner represented those charged with crimes against the state or state property, refusing to represent clients he did not consider to be wrongly accused. He believed that the judiciary had to maintain its independence from the government and not be swayed by politics. This often led to confrontations with those who saw the courts as an enforcer for the communist regime.[3] In 1947, the communist newspaper, Slovenski poro\u010devalec (The Slovene Reporter), published an article strongly criticizing Prenner. It alleged that he undermined the reputation and authority of prosecutors, the court system, the State Security Administration, and the government by inappropriately belittling the performance of officials.[3][30] He was arrested and spent a month and a half in a pre-trial jail located on Miklo\u0161i\u010deva cesta (Miklosich Street). While in jail, he composed the libretto Slovo od mladosti (Farewell from Youth).[3]\nThough Prenner's comedy Veliki mo\u017e (The Great Man) was successfully staged in 1943 at the Ljubljana Drama Theatre, in 1947 it was attacked by the literary censors and he was expelled from the Writers Association. He was not allowed to publish again until 1976.[10] Released from prison in the fall of 1947, he began working part-time at the Institute of the Slovene Language, part of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, advising on legal concepts for the Slovene language dictionary. He was arrested by the State Security Administration in 1949 and returned to the jail on Miklo\u0161i\u010deva cesta.[3] Officially, he was never charged with an offense and kept his job until 1952. He was moved from the pre-trial jail to the Ferdreng Women's Camp and required to work in the quarry. To keep up his spirits and those of the other inmates, Prenner wrote the humorous piece, Pro\u0161nja za novo strani\u0161\u010de (Request for a New Toilet), stressing the inadequacy of three toilets for 300 prisoners. He helped the other prisoners by filing complaints about the poor food and sexual assaults, which often earned him time in solitary confinement.[3][31]\nAfter a new complaint was made against Prenner later in 1949, he was transferred to the Ljubljana District Court Prison, but when the charges were withdrawn, he was sent to the women's prison at Brestanica castle. In January 1950, he was again transferred and imprisoned in the castle at \u0160kofja Loka, where he wrote the play, Vasovalci. He was released without receiving either an indictment or a pardon in May 1950, but had no job to return to,[3][31] as his law license had been revoked.[28] Initially he lived in Ro\u017ena Dolina, with his long-term female partner, Slavica Jelenc, who was a mathematics professor.[32] When his brother-in-law Josip \u0160erbec died, Prenner moved to Be\u017eigrad, where his sister lived. Unable to sell his writing, he took care of the family, helped his nephews who were law students, and worked as a clerk in a law office. Unable to earn enough money to support the family, he and his sister sold their parents' home in Slovenj Gradec, which they had inherited after their parents died in 1945.[3][31]\n\nLater life (1954\u20131976)[edit]\nHaving been barred from working as a lawyer for seven years,[28] after a long letter-writing campaign to various officials and organizations, Prenner regained his license in 1954.[3][31] That year, he hoped to revive his literary career. His libretto Slovo od mladosti was staged by composer Danilo \u0160vara at the Ljubljana Opera House. It received unenthusiastic reviews, closing the door on his literary ambitions. Prenner reopened a practice and hired his nephews, Vojmil and Smiljan \u0160erbec as interns. Once again he became a coveted advocate in the criminal court. Though highly skilled, Prenner's combative nature in court resulted in him being brought before the Bar Association's disciplinary commission several more times in the 1960s.[3][33] He also became popular with personalities who were considered controversial by the communist authorities, such as Lili Novy and Anton Vovk. Bo\u017eidar Jakac painted several portraits of Prenner.[3]\nThough he did not support the Yugoslav communist regime, Prenner acknowledged that after the communists took power, he was able to dress as he pleased.[28] Typically, he was attired in a man's suit, worn with a white shirt and tie, and he carried a briefcase. In public, he always used feminine language to refer to himself, but in private, his friends and family recognized him as a man.[5] With his literary works, Prenner was able to \"come to life as a man\".[34] He was pragmatic about the situation, and has been widely quoted as having introduced himself by saying, \"I am Dr. Ljuba Prenner, neither man nor woman\".[10][5] He also wrote a letter to a colleague explaining that his appearance made his life as a lawyer simpler; though he recognized that he was not a man, he was more comfortable having the freedom to be who he felt he was.[10]\n\n Prenner in 1967\nPrenner made no efforts to hide his sexual orientation[6][12] and his father accepted his gender identity, though his mother did not approve.[35] In his childhood, Prenner met \u0160tefka Vrhnjak, who would later become a teacher and headmistress in Sela, near Slovenj Gradec. Though he had other relationships, Vrhnjak was Prenner's great love and when she died in 1960,[5] Prenner met Marija Krenker at the funeral.[28] Krenker was Vrhnjak's niece and a widow[Notes 2] running an inn to support her four daughters.[10][37] The Bu\u010dinek family, which included the actress Jerica Mrzel\u00a0[sl], provided support for Prenner while he became a father figure for the girls.[28][38] In 1966, he moved to \u0160miklav\u017e and with encouragement from Krenker, began trying to write his memoirs. He wanted to retire, but the authorities claimed he had not worked the requisite years of service, since the years spent writing and in prison were not recognized.[23]\nIn 1967, Prenner's comedy, Gordijski vozel (Gordian Knot) aired on the Italian station Radio Trst A, but he was still unable to publish in Slovenia.[3] Based on his reputation, he was asked in 1968 to give the centenary speech for the bar celebrations. His presentation was Odvetnik v slovenski literaturi (The Lawyer in Slovenian Literature).[3][33] In 1970, he was appointed as the permanent German-language court interpreter for Slovenia,[39] but around that time began having health problems, including diabetes. He retired in 1975 and his nephew Vojmil took over the law office. In 1976, without his having sought acceptance, the Slovene Writers' Association readmitted him to membership and granted him a small pension based on his literary contributions from 1929.[3][23]\n\nDeath and legacy[edit]\nPrenner died on 15 September 1977 at the hospital on Zalo\u0161ko Road, in Ljubljana, Socialist Republic of Slovenia, Yugoslavia,[3][9] from breast cancer.[5] He was buried alongside his parents at the cemetery in Stari Trg.[10] Prenner was recognized for many years as a woman who chose to assert her agency at a time when most women were not allowed to do so,[28] but was rarely recognized in Slovenia as a butch lesbian or transgender man.[40][41] A biography, Odvetnica in pisateljica Ljuba Prenner (Lawyer and Writer Ljuba Prenner) published in 2000, \"completely ignored [Prenner's] sexuality\".[42] Camouflaging the sexual orientation of biographical subjects was common through the 20th century in Slovenia,[43] but in the 21st century more openness in society has allowed a more balanced presentation of Prenner's life, including Prenner's exploration of sex reassignment surgery and studies which call Prenner transgender.[44][45][46][Notes 3]\nPrenner is remembered for an independent spirit, legal expertise, and written works.[28] In 2000, Prenner's biography was published by Nova Revija, drawing on interviews with acquaintances[5] and he was included in the 2007 publication Pozabljena polovica: portreti \u017eensk 19. in 20. stoletja na Slovenskem (Forgotten Half: Portraits of Women of the 19th and 20th Centuries in Slovenia). Other literary and scientific works have assessed Prenner's place in Slovenian history since the dissolution of Yugoslavia.[51] There is a memorial hall dedicated to Prenner's memory in the Carinthian Provincial Museum, which houses his papers and artifacts.[5] On the centennial of his birth, director Boris Jurja\u0161evi\u010d\u00a0[sl] premiered a documentary of his life: Dober \u010dlovek: Ljuba Prenner (The Good Man: Ljuba Prenner).[37]\nPosthumous publication, driven by Mrzel, who is the literary guardian of Prenner's estate, has revealed some of Prenner's previously unpublished works.[38] Among them are\nBruc: roman neznanega slovenskega \u0161tudenta (Freshman: The Novel of an Unknown Slovene Student), which was published in 2006.[24][52] The novel focuses on the experiences of a young man striving to attain an education and the experiences he encounters in the social environment of the interwar period. It explores gender roles and the limits that gender places on one's ability to engage in society, as well as Prenner's awareness that sexual identity was fluid.[53][54] His memoirs, Moji spomini, begun in 1970, were published in 2007.[55]\n\nSelected works[edit]\nPrenner, Ljuba (1929). \"Skok, Cmok in Jokica\".

OCLC\u00a0439642154.\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Most historic texts refer to Prenner as a woman and do not mention either sexuality or gender.[1][2] The majority of biographies consulted indicate Prenner publicly lived as a woman and used feminine language about himself in the public sphere, but in the courtroom, when writing, and in private, lived as a male.[3][4][5][6][7] Prenner had \"an understanding of himself as a lesbian who used masculine identifiers and existed outside of the binary of male and female\".[8]\n\n^ Krenker was twice widowed. Once from her daughters' father, Bu\u010dinek, and later by their step-father.[36]\n\n^ \"Same-sex sexual acts in Slovenia were illegal until 1977\". The first homosexual organization for men was developed in 1984 and for women in 1985. Legal protection of LGBT rights began in 1991.[47] Official state policy in Eastern Europe provided for equality of women, but simultaneously segregated employment and social roles by gender in a binary hierarchy.[48] From the 1990s research on gender history during the Soviet period began by examining all areas of intimate and domestic life. Scholars of gender and sexual variance emerged in the post-socialist era to evaluate the inclusion of homosexuality in the 20th century in the region and to challenge public silences regarding their history.[49] The break-up of the USSR allowed scholars to begin evaluating the history of cultural sexuality within the context of the varying states of Eastern Europe.[50]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\nCitations[edit]\n\n\n^ Tratnik 2001, p.\u00a0375.\n\n^ Greif 2014, p.\u00a0162.\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa Dolgan, Fridl & Volk 2014, pp.\u00a0162\u2013164.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, pp.\u00a01, 88-89.\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n Pirnar 2003.\n\n^ a b c Ciglar 2011, p.\u00a042.\n\n^ \u0160elih 2007, pp.\u00a0436-437.\n\n^ Darling 2018.\n\n^ a b Lukman 2013.\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i Kotnik 2016.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a021.\n\n^ a b Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a01.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a010.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a05.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, pp.\u00a012\u201314.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a016.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a017.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a022.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, pp.\u00a022\u201323.\n\n^ a b c d Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a023.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a087.\n\n^ a b Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a024.\n\n^ a b c Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a031.\n\n^ a b Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a036.\n\n^ Roberts 1973, pp.\u00a017\u201319.\n\n^ a b c d Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a026.\n\n^ Rodogno 2006, p.\u00a083.\n\n^ a b c d e f g h Smajila 2014.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a027.\n\n^ a b c Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a028.\n\n^ a b c d Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a029.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, pp.\u00a029, 84.\n\n^ a b Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, pp.\u00a029\u201330.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a079.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, pp.\u00a079-80.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a082.\n\n^ a b Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a038.\n\n^ a b Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a078.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a030.\n\n^ Petrovi\u0107 2018, p.\u00a0160.\n\n^ Tratnik 2001, pp.\u00a0375\u2013376.\n\n^ Greif 2014, p.\u00a0167.\n\n^ Greif 2014, pp.\u00a0161\u2013162.\n\n^ Petrovi\u0107 2018, pp.\u00a0160-161.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a081.\n\n^ Tratnik 2007.\n\n^ Plut-Pregelj et al. 2018, pp.\u00a0307-308.\n\n^ Baker 2017, pp.\u00a01-3. sfn error: multiple targets (2\u00d7): CITEREFBaker2017 (help)\n\n^ Baker 2017, p.\u00a05. sfn error: multiple targets (2\u00d7): CITEREFBaker2017 (help)\n\n^ Baker 2017, pp.\u00a0229-230. sfn error: multiple targets (2\u00d7): CITEREFBaker2017 (help)\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a02.\n\n^ a b Petrovi\u0107 2018, p.\u00a0199.\n\n^ Petrovi\u0107 2018, pp.\u00a0174\u2013176.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a039.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a043.\n\n^ a b c d e f g Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a033.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a034.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, p.\u00a035.\n\n^ Fabjan\u010di\u010d 2016, pp.\u00a034-35.\n\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\nBaker, Catherine (2017). \"Introduction: Gender in Twentieth-Century Eastern Europe and the USSR\".

She published Transvestia magazine, and started the Foundation for Personality Expression (FPE)[2][3][4][5][6][7][8]\nand later the Society for the Second Self for male heterosexual cross-dressers.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Education and transition period\n3 Transvestia magazine\n4 Trans terminology, crossdresser identity and controversy\n5 References\n6 Further reading\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nPrince was born on November 23, 1912, in Los Angeles, California.[9][10]  At around the age of twelve, Prince began cross-dressing, first using her mother's clothes.[9]  During her time in high school, Prince began cross-dressing more frequently and found herself passing as a girl in public.[11] This came to a crux when Virginia, at the age of 18, went to a church Halloween party\u2014not only in a woman's outfit but indeed passing as a woman\u2014and won first prize. This marked \"\u2026the first occasion in which [Prince] willingly appeared before others as a girl\u2026\" The daughter of a surgeon father and a mother who worked in real estate investment, Prince's early life was one of privilege, with a family that was in her words \"\u2026socially prominent\u2026\"[12]\n\nEducation and transition period[edit]\nPrince was not as open with her transvestism as she became in later life, however it was thanks to a psychiatrist she consulted\u2014at age 30\u2014that she began to live a more comfortable, open lifestyle. Despite having been previously diagnosed with an unresolved Oedipus complex, Prince confided to her doctor, Karl Bowman, about her inclination of crossdressing, who in return advised her to \"\u2026learn to accept [her]self\u2026 and enjoy it.\" Prince credits this psychiatrist, who reminded her that there are many others that live a similar lifestyle, with Transvestia's overarching, recurring theme of self-acceptance.[12]\nPrince gained her PhD in pharmacology in 1939 from the University of California, San Francisco. This was also around the time that she met the woman whom she would marry and have a son with. The two were married in 1941, yet their marriage, according to Prince, \"failed because of [her] transvestism\".[13] After seven years, the two divorced.[9] The news that Prince was served with divorce papers due to her transvestism came as a shock to her \"\u2026socially prominent family\" who threatened to disown her both \"\u2026financially and socially\u2026\" if she could not keep the news from leaking to the media\u2014which it ultimately did.[12]\nAfter her marriage ended, Prince returned to the University of California, San Francisco and began working as a research assistant and lecturer in pharmacology. During this time, Prince took advantage of the university's small collection of medical literature on transvestism. This was also around the time that Prince began using the name Charles Prince, a name used in order to hide her civil identity. The name stems from her father's first name, Charles, and her address on Prince Street.[9] The exact time at which Prince took on the name Virginia is unclear, however one of her earliest known writings, the article \"Homosexuality, Transvestism and Transsexualism: Reflections on Their Etiology and Difference\" published in 1957, is credited to \"C.V. Prince\".[9][14]\n\nTransvestia magazine[edit]\n For the sake of concealability, the first two issues of Transvestia were printed on pamphlets that could be hidden within the palm of one's hand, or one's pocket.\n Front cover of Transvestia, issue 16, from 1962.\nIn 1960, the first issue of Prince's magazine \"Transvestia\" was published. Prince acquired the means to fund the publication after assembling a list of 25 acquaintances, each of whom were willing to donate four dollars to her start-up. Working with one hundred dollars,[11] Prince then launched her first issue, published by her own Chevalier Publications, and sold it by subscription and through adult bookstores.[9]\n\"Transvestia\" was published bi-monthly by Prince between the years of 1960 and 1980, with a total of 100 issues being created. The subsequent 11 issues were edited and published by Carol Beecroft (the co-founder of Chevalier publications) until 1986. In 1963, the inside jacket of the magazine stated the publication as \"dedicated to the needs of the sexually normal individual who has discovered the existance [sic] of his or her 'other side' and seeks to express it.\"[9] Rather than relying on a team of professional authors, this magazine was to be\"\u2026written by\u2026 the readers\u2026\" with the editor's (Virginia Prince) job to be organizing and categorizing these submissions as appropriate.[15]\nWith a readership of mostly white, middle-to-professional-class crossdressers, the magazine offered, among other things, dozens of published life stories and letters contributed by other crossdressers.[16] Over the years, the publication also gained several international subscribers, notably from England, Scandinavia and Australia.[9] Prince herself, wrote an autobiographical article for the magazine's final issue in 1979.[12] This final issue edited by Virginia Prince (issue 100), was unusual among \"Transvestia\" issues as it was solely an autobiographical account of Virginia's life, in which she recounted her early experiences with crossdressing, her divorce, and her work creating and maintaining \"Transvestia\".\nThe magazine operated on three core objectives: \"To provide expression for those interested in the subjects of unusual dress and fashion\u2026 to provide information to those who, through ignorance, condemn that which they don't understand\u2026 [and] to provide education for those who see evil when none exists.\" These three objectives\u2014education, entertainment, and expression\u2014were promoted in order to \"...help\u2026 readers achieve understanding, self-acceptance, [and] peace of mind\".[17]  \"Transvestia\" was primarily a story driven magazine, however every issue contained a \"person to person\" section, in which ads for meeting others and businesses advertising transgender friendly services would be printed. This section also included a goods and services for sale section, as well as a trade and rent section.[17]\nThe magazine's others sections included Stories (true and fictional), articles (medical, psychological, or personal opinion about any phase of transvestism), a question box (questions from readers that warrant a reply or further discussion), a wives section (in which spouses were encouraged to contribute opinions on transvestism for the general enlightenment of all), letters to the editor (questions, comments, brick-bats and bouquets [criticisms and compliments]), general (poems, humor, news. They were typically short notes to fill sections of pages or break up longer articles), and Tranvestia was, in essence, an early example of a crowd-sourced publication.[17]\nAlthough \"Transvestia\" was published for 20 years, it was not originally a successful venture. Virginia Prince recounts in her autobiographical issue that originally the cost of production was too high to be sustainable, due to its having been printed on mimeograph paper. Ultimately it was not until Prince \"\u2026found an offset printer\u2026\" and gathered more subscribers that Transvestia became a success.[12]\n\"Transvestia's\" audience consisted largely of men who were interested in feminine apparel, because their desires to express themselves were frowned upon by the rest of society. While \"Transvestia\" was a magazine for crossdressers in general, it was mainly directed at men (as women who cross-dressed were not as marginalized by society during the 1960s).[17]\n\nTrans terminology, crossdresser identity and controversy[edit]\nThrough many of her writings, Prince has been considered a major pioneer of transgender community.[9] Her long history of literature surrounding issues of crossdressing and transvestism has been rooted in Prince's desire to fight against those who disagree with liberal sexual ideology.[9][18] Notably, in her 1967 \"The Expression of Femininity in the Male\" (under the pen name \"Virginia Bruce\"), Prince discusses the supposed psychiatric links between cross dressing and sexual deviation that were commonly believed in at the time. Prince firmly rejected these associations, and was also strongly opposed to the notion that true transvestites are psychiatrically disturbed.[19]\nIn other works, Prince also helped popularize the term 'transgender', and erroneously asserted that she coined transgenderist and transgenderism, words which she meant to be understood as describing people who live as full-time women, but have no intention of having genital surgery.[18] Prince also consistently argued that transvestism is very firmly related to gender, as opposed to sex or sexuality.[18] Her use of the term \"femmiphile\" related to the belief that the term \"transvestite\" had been corrupted, intending to underline the distinction between heterosexual crossdressers, who act because of their love of the feminine, and the homosexuals or transsexuals who may cross-dress.[9][20][21] Although Prince identified with the concept of androgyny (stating in her autobiographical 100th issue that she could \"\u2026do [her] own thing whichever it is\u2026\"), she preferred to identify as Gynandrous. This, she explained, is because although 'Charles' still resides within her, \"\u2026the feminine is more important than the masculine.\"[12] Prince's idea of a \"true transvestite\"[14] was clearly distinguished from both the homosexual and the transsexual, claiming that true transvestites are \"exclusively heterosexual... The transvestite values his male organs, enjoys using them and does not desire them removed.\"[14]\nBy the early 1970s, Prince and her approaches to crossdressing and transvestism were starting to gain criticism from transvestites and transsexuals, as well as sections of the gay and women's movements of the time. Controversy and criticism has arisen based on Prince's support for conventional societal norms such as marriage and the traditional family model, as well as the portrayal of traditional gender stereotypes. Her attempts to exclude transsexuals, homosexuals or fetishists from her normalization efforts of the practice of transvestism have also drawn much criticism.[9]\nPrince died in her hometown Los Angeles on May 2, 2009.[16][22]\n\nReferences[edit]\nThe citations in this article lack sufficient bibliographical information (e.g. author, title, date of publication, publisher, ISBN, OCLC number, pages cited, etc.).

Pritzker.[6] She has two siblings, Linda Pritzker (b. 1953) and Karen Pritzker Vlock (b. 1958).[7] Her parents divorced in 1979, and she has two half-siblings, Matthew Pritzker and Liesel Pritzker Simmons, from the remarriage of her father, Robert, to Irene Dryburgh in 1980.[8] (Her mother also remarried, to Albert B. Ratner in 1981).[9]\n\nCollege and enlisted service (1974\u20131979)[edit]\nPritzker says her most memorable experiences in life were in Israel in October 1973 when she witnessed events of the Yom Kippur War.[5] Pritzker enlisted in the U.S. Army on February 8, 1974, and served with the HQ Troop, and with the B Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, both in the 82nd Airborne Division based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, rising to the rank of Sergeant.[5] Pritzker's roles while enlisted included aviation repair parts clerk, rifleman, and fire team leader.\nAfter completing military service in February 1977,[5] Pritzker enrolled at Loyola University of Chicago, majoring in history, and entered its Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps program.[5] Pritzker graduated with a BA in History in May 1979, and received commission as an Army officer that same month.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nPritzker first served with the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, with duty assignments that included leading rifle and TOW platoons, and time in the Commandant Division, and the Anti-Armor School.[5] Pritzker served as a staff officer with the VII Corps at Kelley Barracks,[citation needed] in Germany, from 1984\u20131985.[5] Her active duty ended in 1985.[10][verification needed] After 16 years in the Army Reserves and Illinois Army National Guard,[11] Pritzker retired from the United States Army as a lieutenant colonel, in 2001.[12] After retiring, Pritzker was promoted to the honorary rank of Colonel in the Illinois Army National Guard.[10][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nWhile serving,[where?] Pritzker was awarded[when?] the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Army Achievement Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Good Conduct Medal, the Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters, the National Defense Service Medal with Star, the Antarctic Service Medal, the Outstanding Military Volunteer Service Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with 20 year Device, the NCO Professional Development Ribbon, the Army Service Ribbon, the Army Reserve Component Overseas Training Ribbon, the State of Louisiana Legion of Merit, the State of Illinois Long and Honorable Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the State of Illinois Military Attendance Ribbon with Numeral 7, the U.S. Army Parachute Badge and the Air Assault Badge.[10][verification needed]\nPritzker earned airborne badges from Israel, Russia, Canada, the Netherlands, and Great Britain,[5][10][verification needed] as well as from Poland;[10][verification needed] according to Steven Mrozek, \"Most memorable of these was a parachute jump at the North Pole with the Russians in 1993.\"[5]\nPritzker has founded or served with a number of business and philanthropic organizations. In 1996, she incorporated Tawani Enterprises, where she served as president and CEO,[5] a business entity with current stated purpose as a \"private wealth management company established to manage the personal wealth, philanthropic endeavors, and military interests of Colonel (IL) J.N. Pritzker.\"[13][14][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Interests of the company include significant Chicago real estate holdings.[15][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In 1995, Pritzker created the Tawani Foundation, and in 2003, she founded the Pritzker Military Library, both dedicated to the understanding and support of the \"citizen soldier.\"[10][11] In addition, Pritzker serves as Chairwoman of the Board of the Connecticut-based private equity firm Squadron Capital LLC, in which she has been identified a principal investor.[11][when?][10][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed][16][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Finally, Pritzker has served as Special Projects Director for the National Strategy Forum,[when?][17] as Chairman of the Board and co-owner of National Security Ltd. (1988\u20131995),[verification needed][18][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed][5] and is active in number of further philanthropic enterprises.[clarification needed][5]\nIn 2016, Jennifer Pritzker was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto, for her contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification.[19]\n\nFamily businesses[edit]\nJennifer Pritzker's father Robert, and Robert's brothers Jay and Donald, built and diversified a Chicago-based family business, the Marmon Group, into a holding company of more than 60 diverse industrial corporations;[citation needed] they also created the Hyatt Hotel chain in 1957, and owned Braniff Airlines from 1983\u20131988.[1] The family later began divesting of many of these assets. In 2006, the family sold Conwood, a smokeless tobacco company, for $3.5 billion to cigarette company Reynolds American Inc.[20] In 2007, the family sold a 60% stake, and sold control of the Marmon Group to Berkshire Hathaway for $4.5 billion,[1] a sale that it completed in 2013.[21][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In 2010, the family sold its majority stake in Transunion, the Chicago-based credit reporting company, to Chicago-based private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners for an undisclosed amount.[20] As a member of the Robert's line of the Pritzker family, Jennifer Prizker has inherited and accumulated wealth that is estimated at US$1.7 billion.[1]\n\nPhilanthropy[edit]\nPritzker created the Tawani Foundation in 1995,[22] which aims \"to enhance the awareness and understanding of the importance of the Citizen Soldier; to preserve unique sites of significance to American and military history; to foster health and wellness projects for improved quality of life; and to honor the service of military personnel, past, present and future.\"[22][23] In 2003, the Tawani Foundation made a $1.35 million donation to the Palm Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to study the feasibility of transgender people serving in the military and in the ranks of police and fire departments.[11] In 2013, the Foundation donated $25 million to Norwich University, in Northfield, Vermont, the school credited with developing and establishing the first Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program in the country.[24] So closely tied is this founder to the Foundation, that news reports of the Foundation's gifts refer to Jennifer Pritzker and the Foundation, interchangeably, as being the donor (e.g., in the Norwich gift).[24] In 2016, through her Foundation, Pritzker gave a $2 million donation to create the world's first endowed academic chair of transgender studies, at the University of Victoria in British Columbia; Aaron Devor was chosen as the inaugural chair.[25]\n\nPolitical causes[edit]\nPritzker is a lifelong Republican,[2] and major donor to candidates and organizations such as the NRA, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.[3][4] However, as of 2019 she is reevaluating her support, citing the Trump Administration's transgender military ban and other anti-LGBTQ policies: \"When the GOP asks me to deliver six- or seven-figure contributions for the 2020 elections, my first response will be: why should I contribute to my own destruction?\u201d.[26]\nIn August 2020, Priztker donated $2,000 to the presidential campaign of Joe Biden.[27]\nIn October 2020, Pritzker donated $100,000 to the Lincoln Project, led by Republican Strategists, some of who endorse Joe Biden to prevent the re-election of Donald Trump.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nPritzker has a daughter, Tal Hava Pritzker, from a first marriage to Ayelet Pritzker, and two sons, Andrew (b. 1991) and William, from her marriage to Lisa I. Goren.[5][10][28] As of 2014[update], she was divorced.[29][1]\nOn August 16, 2013, a statement was released to employees at Tawani Enterprises and the Pritzker Military Library indicating Pritzker to be the world's first transgender billionaire;[30] the announcement read:\n\nAs of August 16, 2013, J. N. Pritzker will undergo an official legal name change, will now be known as Jennifer Natalya Pritzker. This change will reflect the beliefs of her true identity that she has held privately and will now share publicly. Pritzker now identifies herself as a woman for all business and personal undertakings.[31]\nOn October 31, 2020 Jennifer N. Pritzker married Erin E. Solaro.[32]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e \"Forbes profile: Jennifer Pritzker\". Retrieved September 28, 2020.\n\n^ a b Janssen, Kim. \"J.B.

Her father is former footballer Peter Raskopoulos, and her brother is Steen Raskopoulos, a fellow comedian.\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Logies controversy\n3 Personal life\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2003, Raskopoulos became involved with Impro Australia's Theatresports events including The Belvoir St Theatre Theatresports and the Cranston Cup competitions, winning State and National Titles.[3] In 2005, she became part of the university sketch comedy supergroup The 3rd Degree who performed at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. This group formed the base of the Network Ten's Logie award-winning cult ensemble sketch comedy television show The Ronnie Johns Half Hour, in which Raskopoulos starred and for which she wrote.[2]\nAfter the success of The Ronnie Johns Half Hour, Raskopoulos went on to appear in Stupid, Stupid Man, Stand Up Australia, Hole in the Wall, Good News Week and Thank God You're Here, and has provided voices for the ABC2 machinima series The Team. She was a team captain for a season of the SBS sports show The Squiz.[4] In 2007, her debut solo stage show was called The Adventures of the Man with the Dominant Claw.[5] With her band The Axis of Awesome, Raskopoulos has appeared on Q&A, Good News Week and The Footy Show.\nSince 2006, Raskopoulos has fronted the award-winning musical comedy trio The Axis of Awesome, whose parody song \"4 Chords\" has received almost 61\u00a0million hits on YouTube and is one of the highest-rated comedy videos on the site. The group came to attention after the release of their songs parodying the 2007 Australian federal election and received a Moosehead award at the 2008 Melbourne International Comedy Festival for their show The Axis of Awesome Comeback Spectacular.[6] Since 2009, the Axis of Awesome have produced four albums and toured extensively in the USA, UK, Europe, Asia and Australia, with sold-out seasons at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.\n\nLogies controversy[edit]\nRaskopoulos was cast in the supporting role of Trax in the 2012 movie Underground: The Julian Assange Story[7] along with Rachel Griffiths, Anthony LaPaglia and Alex Williams. In January 2013, Raskopoulos requested users of the internet forum Something Awful to vote for her in the most popular actor category of the 2013 Logie Awards, promising in return to allow site users to write her acceptance speech. This caused some controversy, with news outlets reporting that Raskopoulos, who despite a high-profile international comedy career was relatively unknown in Australian acting circles, planned to 'hack' the Logies.[8][9] Raskopoulos herself described her campaign as no different to any ordinary \"fan\" campaign, stating: \"I'm conspiring to rig the Logies in the same way Guy Sebastian's fan forums are, or [in the same way as] fans of The Voice are calling for votes for Joel Madden on Twitter.\"[10] In support of her campaign to win votes, Raskopoulos appeared in a segment on Australian current affairs program Today Tonight dressed in a fur collar and acting in character, and stated that she wished to win a Logie for use as a doorstop.[11]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRaskopoulos is a transgender woman who came out publicly in 2016. She kept her given name but added the middle names Nicola and Bridget.[1][12] In 2017, she spoke about her anxiety disorder at a TEDx talk.[13] Raskopoulos plays roller derby and has played Warhammer 40,000 since she was 12 years old.[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"What's Happened To Jordan's Beard?\".\n\n^ a b Jordan Raskopoulos' Dominant Claw, Australian Comedy Review, 23 April 2007.\n\n^ Impro Australia, ImproAustralia.com.au.\n\n^ The Squiz on SBS, SBS.\n\n^ Don't call me 'Clawed' Archived 29 September 2011 at the Wayback Machine, The Blurb.\n\n^ Infinity Rock Explosion!

She challenged that policy, and the New York Supreme Court ruled in her favor, a landmark case in transgender rights.[2] As one of the first professional athletes to identify as transgender, she became a spokesperson for transgender people in sports.[3][4][5] After retiring as a player, she coached Martina Navratilova to two Wimbledon titles.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Transition\n3 Court case\n4 Tennis career after transitioning\n5 Retirement\n6 Movies and books\n7 Grand Slam singles tournament timeline\n\n7.1 Men's singles\n7.2 Women's singles\n\n\n8 Grand Slam doubles tournament timeline\n9 Grand Slam mixed doubles tournament timeline\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nRichards was born on August 19, 1934, in New York City, named \"Richard Raskind\", and raised, as she put it, as \"a nice Jewish boy\" in Forest Hills, Queens.[3][6][7][8][9][10] Her father David Raskind was an orthopedic surgeon, and her mother was one of the first female psychiatrists in the United States, in addition to being a professor at Columbia University.[3][6]\nRichards attended Horace Mann School and excelled as the wide receiver for the football team, the pitcher for the baseball team, and on the tennis and swim teams.[3][6] Her baseball skills even led to an invitation to join the New York Yankees, but she decided to focus on tennis.[3] After high school Richards attended Yale University and was captain of the men's tennis team,[3][6] and was considered by some to be one of the best college tennis players in the country.[3] After graduating from Yale, she went to the University of Rochester Medical Center and specialized in ophthalmology,[3] graduating in 1959 and serving a two-year internship at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York.[3][6] After an internship, she served two years of residency at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in New York.[6] She played competitive tennis for a while and was ranked sixth out of the top 20 males over 35.[3][6] After an internship and residency, she joined the United States Navy to continue medical training and played tennis in the Navy.[3] While serving in the Navy, she won both the singles and doubles at the All Navy Championship, with a very effective left-hand serve.[3] During this time she was ranked as high as fourth in the region.[3]\n\nTransition[edit]\nDuring college Richards began dressing as a woman, which at the time was considered to be a perversion, with transsexualism classified as a form of insanity.[3] Richards named her female persona \"Ren\u00e9e\", which is French for \"reborn\".[3] Her struggle with gender identity created sexual confusion, depression, and suicidal tendencies.[6] She began seeing Dr. Charles Ihlenfeld, a disciple of Harry Benjamin who specialized in endocrinology, transsexualism, and sexual reassignment.[3] Upon seeing Ihlenfeld she began getting hormone injections with the long-term hope for a life change.[3] In the mid-1960s she traveled in Europe dressed as a woman, intending to go to North Africa to see Georges Burou, a famous gynecological surgeon at Clinique Parc in Casablanca, Morocco, regarding sex reassignment surgery; however, she ultimately decided against it and returned to New York.[3] Richards married model Barbara Mole in June 1970, and together they had a son Nicholas in 1972. They were divorced in 1975.[3][11][12]\nIn the early 1970s, Richards resolved to undergo sex reassignment and was referred to surgeon Roberto C. Granato Sr. by Harry Benjamin, successfully transitioning in 1975.[3][13][14] After surgery, Richards went to Newport Beach, California and started working as an ophthalmologist in practice with another doctor.[3][6]\n\nCourt case[edit]\nIn 1976, Richards' gender reassignment was outed by local TV anchor Richard Carlson, the father of Tucker Carlson.[15] Subsequently the United States Tennis Association (USTA), the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), and the United States Open Committee (USOC) required all female competitors to verify their sex with a  Barr body test of their chromosomes.[3][6][16] Richards applied to play in the US Open in 1976 as a woman, but refused to take the test, and thus was not allowed to compete in the Open, Wimbledon, or the Italian Open in the summer of 1976.[3]\nRichards then sued the United States Tennis Association (USTA), which runs the US Open, in New York state court, alleging discrimination by gender in violation of the New York Human Rights Law.[3][6][16] She asserted that participating in the tournament would constitute \"an acceptance of her right to be a woman.\"[6] Some USTA members felt that others would undergo sex change to enter women's tennis.[3][6] Sports Illustrated called Richards an \"extraordinary spectacle\", and characterized reactions to her as \"varying from astonishment to suspicion, sympathy, resentment, and more often than not, utter confusion.\"[6] The USOC stated \"there is competitive advantage for a male who has undergone a sex change surgery as a result of physical training and development as a male.\"[6][17] Richards finally agreed to take the Barr body test. The test results were ambiguous. She refused to take it again and was barred from play.[6]\nOn August 16, 1977, Judge Alfred M. Ascione found in Richards' favor. He ruled: \"This person is now a female\" and that requiring Richards to pass the Barr body test was \"grossly unfair, discriminatory and inequitable, and a violation of her rights.\"[4][18] He further ruled that the USTA intentionally discriminated against Richards, and granted Richards an injunction against the USTA and the USOC, allowing her to play in the US Open.[4][6] Richards lost to Virginia Wade in the first round of the singles competition, but made it to the finals in doubles.[3][6][16]\n\nTennis career after transitioning[edit]\nExternal video Interview with Renee Richards on The Robert MacNeil Report; Transexuality and Sports 1976-08-23, American Archive of Public Broadcasting (WGBH and the Library of Congress), Boston, MA and Washington, DC\nAfter moving to California, Richards played in regional competitions for her local club, the John Wayne Tennis Club, under the name Ren\u00e9e Clark.[3][6] In the summer of 1976 she entered the La Jolla Tennis Tournament Championships, where she crushed the competition, and her unique left hand serve was recognized by Bob Perry, a tour player from UCLA.[3] Her long-time friend Gene Scott then invited her to play in his professional tennis tournament, the Tennis Week Open in South Orange, New Jersey. The USTA and the WTA then withdrew their sanction for the Tennis Week Open, and organized another tournament; 25 of the 32 participants withdrew from the Tennis Week Open.[3][4][6] This was just the beginning of the issues Richards would encounter in trying to play professional women's tennis, which eventually led to her suing the USTA and winning. \nRichards played professionally from 1977 to 1981 when she retired at age 47.[3][4][16] She was ranked as high as 20th overall (in February 1979), and her highest ranking at the end of a year was 22nd (in 1977). Her first professional event as a female was the 1977 U.S. Open. Her greatest successes on court were reaching the doubles final at her first U.S. Open in 1977, with Betty Ann Grubb Stuart \u2013 the pair lost a close match to Martina Navratilova and Betty St\u00f6ve \u2013 and winning the 35-and-over women's singles. Richards was twice a semifinalist in mixed doubles, with Ilie N\u0103stase, at the U.S. Open. In 1979, she defeated Nancy Richey for the 35-and-over singles title at the Open. Richards posted wins over Hana Mandl\u00edkov\u00e1, Sylvia Hanika, Virginia Ruzici, and Pam Shriver. She later coached Navratilova to two Wimbledon wins.\nRichards was inducted into the USTA Eastern Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000.[19] On August 2, 2013, Richards was among the first class of inductees into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame.[20]\nRichards has since expressed ambivalence about her legacy, and came to believe her past as a man provided her with advantages over her competitors, saying \"Having lived for the past 30 years, I know if I'd had surgery at the age of 22, and then at 24 went on the tour, no genetic woman in the world would have been able to come close to me. And so I've reconsidered my opinion.\"[21][22]\n\nRetirement[edit]\nAfter four years of playing tennis, she decided to return to her medical practice, which she moved to Park Avenue in New York.[3][6] She then became the surgeon director of ophthalmology and head of the eye-muscle clinic at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital.[6] In addition she served on the editorial board of the Journal of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.[3][6] She now lives in a small town north of New York City with her platonic companion Arleen Larzelere.[3]\nIn 2014 a wooden racket used by her was donated to the National Museum of American History, which is part of the Smithsonian.[23]\n\nMovies and books[edit]\nIn 1983, Richards published an autobiography, Second Serve,[24] and in 2007, a second, No Way Ren\u00e9e: The Second Half of My Notorious Life, in which she expresses regret over the type of fame that came with her transgenderism, although she said in 2007 that she did not regret undergoing the sex reassignment process in itself.[25] Richards's first autobiography served as the basis for the film Second Serve.[4] Ren\u00e9e is a 2011 documentary film about Richards. The film was one of the anchor films of the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival and the documentary premiered on ESPN on October 4, 2011.[26]\n\nGrand Slam singles tournament timeline[edit]\nMen's singles[edit]\n(as Richard Raskind)\n\n\n\nTournament\n1953\n1954\n1955\n1956\n1957\n1958\n1959\n1960\nCareer SR\n\n\nAustralia\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nFrance\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nWimbledon\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nUnited States\n\n1R\n\nA\n\n2R\n\n1R\n\n2R\n\nA\n\nA\n\n1R\n\n0/5\n\n\nSR\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 0\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 0\n\n0 / 0\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 5\n\nWomen's singles[edit]\n(as Ren\u00e9e Richards)\n\n\n\nTournament\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\nCareer SR\n\n\nAustralia\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nFrance\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nWimbledon\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nUnited States\n\n1R\n\n1R\n\n3R\n\n2R\n\n1R\n\n0/5\n\n\nSR\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 5\n\nA = did not participate in the tournament.\nSR = the ratio of the number of singles tournaments won to the number of those tournaments played.\nNote: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December.\n\nGrand Slam doubles tournament timeline[edit]\n\n\nTournament\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\nCareer SR\n\n\nAustralia\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nFrance\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nWimbledon\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nUnited States\n\nF\n\n2R\n\nA\n\n3R\n\n3R\n\n0/4\n\n\nSR\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 0\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 4\n\nA = did not participate in the tournament.\nSR = the ratio of the number of singles tournaments won to the number of those tournaments played.\nNote: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December.\n\nGrand Slam mixed doubles tournament timeline[edit]\n\n\nTournament\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\nCareer SR\n\n\nAustralia\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nFrance\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nWimbledon\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\n-\n\n\nUnited States\n\nA\n\n3R\n\nSF\n\n1R\n\nA\n\n0/3\n\n\nSR\n\n0 / 0\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 1\n\n0 / 0\n\n0 / 3\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of select Jewish tennis players\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Bostic, Stephanie, ed.

She became recognized as the first openly transgender reality television star.[2] Rivera also modelled and, using the name Victoria, performed in pornography.[3] She was found dead in February 2019 at her apartment in Mexico.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n2 Personal life and death\n3 Filmography\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nRivera was born in 1981 in Mexico and desired a sex change to female at the age of four. She said that while her three brothers liked baseball, she preferred Barbie dolls.[4] Rivera said strangers assumed she was a girl:They used to come to my mother and say, \"Oh you have a beautiful daughter\", and my mother used to say \"That's my son\", and I used to get angry. And I have always been attracted to men. When I was 11, I met someone who's gay and start talking to me about hormones, which I got very interested in.[5]\nRivera said she soon started taking hormones. She told reporters she came out after being suspended from school at age 12, and her family was supportive.[6]\nIn 1999, Rivera posed for a transgender website and performed under the name Victoria in pornographic videos produced by Androgeny Productions and released from 2000.[3]\nRemy Blumenfeld first saw Rivera participating in a girl band, after which he planned to cast her in a TV show that was later released as There's Something About Miriam.[7] She was filmed in Ibiza for There's Something About Miriam in 2003, but the show's airdate was delayed until out-of-court settlement of litigation by contestants in 2004. It originally aired in the United Kingdom on Sky1 in February 2004. Hosted by Tim Vincent, it featured six men wooing Rivera without revealing that she was transgender until the final episode. Rivera enjoyed the attention she received following the show.[8]\nAfter the high ratings for the show, she was cast as a guest on Big Brother Australia 2004, also produced by Endemol. A documentary about her life was commissioned but not aired.[9]\nShe stated she never planned to have sex reassignment surgery, citing concerns about complications or loss of sensation.[5] She said, \"My mother always says to me, 'Why would you want to be half-and-half? Why don't you want to be a complete woman?' But I just love myself and I'm really enjoying my life.\"[10]\nThe New York Post reported that Rivera was seriously injured in 2007 when she was thrown out of a third-story window at her home.[11] Rivera later told reporters she fell out of a fourth-story window while trying to escape a burglar.[12] In 2008, she was a special guest on Ewa Drzyzga's TVN show Rozmowy w toku in Poland.  In more recent years, Rivera was active in Manhattan's ball culture.[13]\n\nPersonal life and death[edit]\nRivera was married to Daniel Cuervo, with whom she lived in New York City.[13] She was found dead on 5 February 2019, in her apartment in Mexico.[7] Her death was confirmed by Cuervo in a Facebook post and received news coverage six months later.[2][7] Her death was classified as suicide by hanging by the police, but Cuervo believes she was murdered as she received a death threat from someone who told her to \"never come back to Mexico\" and not prepare her funeral.[13]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nThere's Something About Miriam (2003, Brighter Pictures)[14]\nBig Brother Australia 2004 (2004, Endemol)[15]\nTV Burp (2004)\nRove Live (2004)\nGood Morning Australia (2004)\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT culture in New York City\nList of self-identified LGBTQ New Yorkers\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Goza transexual mexicano popularidad en Europa S\u00e1bado\".

Rivera, who identified as a drag queen,[6][7][8] participated in demonstrations with the Gay Liberation Front.[9]\nWith close friend Marsha P. Johnson, Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens, gay youth, and trans women.[10]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Activism\n3 Gender identity\n4 Death\n5 Legacy\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nRivera was born and raised in New York City and lived most of her life in or near the city; she was of Puerto Rican and Venezuelan descent.[6] She was abandoned by her birth father Jos\u00e9 Rivera early in life and became an orphan after her mother died by suicide when Rivera was three years old.[11] Rivera was then raised by her Venezuelan grandmother, who disapproved of Rivera's effeminate behavior, particularly after Rivera began to wear makeup in fourth grade.[11] As a result, Rivera began living on the streets at the age of 11 and was forced to work as a child prostitute. She was taken in by the local community of drag queens, who gave her the name Sylvia.[12]\n\nActivism[edit]\nRivera's activism began in 1970 after she joined the Gay Activists Alliance at 18 years old, where she fought for not only the rights of gay people but also for the inclusion of drag queens like herself in the movement.[13]  Rivera sometimes exaggerated her importance, purporting to have been active during the civil rights movement and through the movement against the Vietnam war and second-wave feminist movements, but she could not prove her claims.[13] After her older friend, Marsha P. Johnson, was being praised for being involved in the Stonewall Riots, Rivera  claimed that she was also present there.[13][14] Stonewall historian David Carter, however, questioned Rivera's claims to have ever been at the riots that night, based on contradictory statements she made as well as testimony relayed to him by early gay rights activists, including Marsha P. Johnson, who denied Rivera was present at the riots.[15]\nIn 1973, Rivera famously spoke at a gay rights rally after she and Johnson were reportedly banned for making other gay activists \"look bad\". Afterwards, she told anyone who would listen that she was involved in the Stonewall riots, to which Johnson replied, \"Sylvia, you know you weren't there\", after which Rivera was silent.[13] When the Stonewall riots occurred, Rivera was only 17 years old and according to Bob Kohler, who was there on the two nights of the riots, \"always hung out uptown at Bryant Park\" and never came downtown.[13] Johnson told gay rights historian Eric Marcus in 1987 that in the hours prior to her arriving downtown to join the other protesters at the riots, she had a party uptown and mentioned that \"Rivera and them were over in the [Bryant] park having a cocktail.\"[13] Kohler told Carter that, although Rivera had not been at the uprising, he hoped Carter would nonetheless portray her as having been there. Another Stonewall veteran, Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt, claimed that he wanted to add her \"so that young Puerto Rican transgender people on the street would have a role model.\"[13] Kohler and Rivera had a discussion over what to include in the book and denied Rivera's requests to be portrayed as being the one to throw the first molotov cocktail, throwing the first brick, and having thrown the first bottle, only allowing Rivera to be portrayed as someone who had \"thrown a bottle\" as opposed to being \"the first\".[13] Randy Wicker, who was part of the Mattachine Society and was an early critic of the violent, militant tactics used by Johnson and other Stonewall veterans, said Johnson had told him that Sylvia was not at Stonewall \"as she was asleep after taking heroin uptown\".[13] Rivera would also claim to have been involved in Puerto Rican and African American youth activism, particularly with the Young Lords and Black Panthers.[11]\nAt different times in her life, Rivera battled substance abuse and lived on the streets, largely in the gay homeless community at the Christopher Street docks.[2] Her experiences made her more focused on advocacy for those who, in her view, mainstream society and the assimilationist sectors of the gay community was leaving behind.[16] For these reasons Rivera projected her voice to give her community power. She fought for herself but most importantly for the rights of people of color and low-income LGBT people. As someone who suffered from systematic poverty and racism, Rivera used her voice for unity, sharing her stories, pain, and struggles to show her community they are not alone. She amplified the voices of the most vulnerable members of the gay community: drag queens, homeless youth, gay inmates in prison and jail, and transgender people.[17]\nJohnson was Rivera's close friend, and the two often worked together politically. Their discussions led to activism and in 1970, Rivera and Johnson co-founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR). STAR offered services and advocacy for homeless queer youth,[18] and fought for the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act in New York. SONDA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, public accommodations, education, credit, and the exercise of civil rights.[12]\nAt the 1973 Christopher Street Liberation Day Rally in New York City, Rivera, representing STAR, gave a brief speech from the main stage in which she called out the heterosexual males who were preying on vulnerable members of the community. Rivera espoused what could be seen as a third gender perspective, saying that LGBT prisoners seeking help \"do not write women. They do not write men. They write to STAR.\"[19] At the same event, Rivera and fellow queen Lee Brewster jumped onstage during feminist activist Jean O'Leary's speech and shouts at the crowd her \u201cY\u2019all Better Quiet Down,\" speech, stating, \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!\"[16][20]\nIn early July 1992, shortly after the New York City Pride March, Johnson's body was found floating in the Hudson River off the West Village Piers. Police promptly ruled Johnson's death a suicide, despite the presence of a head wound.[21] Johnson's friends and supporters, Rivera included, insisted Johnson had not been suicidal, and a people's postering campaign later declared that Johnson had earlier been harassed near the spot where her body was found. In May 1995, Rivera tried to commit suicide by walking into the Hudson River.[22] That year she also appeared in the Arthur Dong documentary episode \"Out Rage '69\", part of the PBS series The Question of Equality,[23] and gave an extensive interview to gay journalist Randy Wicker in which she discussed her suicide attempts, Johnson's life and death, and her advocacy for poor and working-class gay people made homeless by the AIDS crisis.[2]\nIn the last five years of her life, Rivera renewed her political activity, giving many speeches about the Stonewall Uprising[24] and the necessity for transgender people, including drag queens and butch dykes, to fight for their legacy at the forefront of the LGBT movement. She traveled to Italy for the Millennium March in 2000, where she was acclaimed as the \"mother of all gay people\".[14] In early 2001, after a service at the Metropolitan Community Church of New York referring to the Star of Bethlehem announcing the birth of Jesus, she decided to resurrect STAR as an active political organization (now changing \"Transvestite\" to the more recently coined term \"Transgender,\" which at that time was understood to include all gender-nonconforming people).[25] STAR fought for the New York City Transgender Rights Bill and for a trans-inclusive New York State Sexual Orientation Non Discrimination Act. STAR also sponsored street pressures for justice for Amanda Milan, a transgender woman murdered in 2000.[14] Rivera attacked Human Rights Campaign and Empire State Pride Agenda as organizations that were standing in the way of transgender rights. On her deathbed she met with Matt Foreman and Joe Grabarz of ESPA to negotiate transgender inclusion in its political structure and agenda.\nRivera was angered by her perception that the significance of drag queens and drag culture was being minimized by the ostensibly assimilationist gay rights agenda, particularly by new would-be \"gay leaders\" who were focusing on military service (Don't Ask Don't Tell) and marriage equality.[14][26] Rivera's conflicts with these newer LGBT groups were emblematic of the mainstream LGBT movement's strained relationship to the radical politics of many earlier gay liberation activists. After Rivera's death, Michael Bronski recalled her anger when she felt that she was being marginalized within the community:\n\nAfter Gay Liberation Front folded and the more reformist Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) became New York's primary gay rights group, Sylvia Rivera worked hard within their ranks in 1971 to promote a citywide gay rights, anti-discrimination ordinance. But for all of her work, when it came time to make deals, GAA dropped the portions in the civil rights bill that dealt with transvestitism and drag \u2014 it just wasn't possible to pass it with such \"extreme\" elements included. As it turned out, it wasn't possible to pass the bill anyway until 1986. But not only was the language of the bill changed, GAA \u2014 which was becoming increasingly more conservative, several of its founders and officers had plans to run for public office \u2014 even changed its political agenda to exclude issues of transvestitism and drag. It was also not unusual for Sylvia to be urged to \"front\" possibly dangerous demonstrations, but when the press showed up, she would be pushed aside by the more middle-class, \"straight-appearing\" leadership. In 1995, Rivera was still hurt: \"When things started getting more mainstream, it was like, 'We don't need you no more'\". But, she added, \"Hell hath no fury like a drag queen scorned\".[27]\nAccording to Bronski, Rivera was banned from New York's Gay & Lesbian Community Center for several years in the mid-1990s, because, on a cold winter's night, she aggressively demanded that the Center take care of poor and homeless queer youth. A short time before her death, Bronski reports that she said:\n\nOne of our main goals now is to destroy the Human Rights Campaign, because I'm tired of sitting on the back of the bumper. It's not even the back of the bus anymore \u2014 it's the back of the bumper. The bitch on wheels is back.[27]\nRivera's struggles did not relate exclusively to gay and trans people, as they intersected with issues of poverty and discrimination faced by people of color, which caused friction in the GAA as it was mainly made up of white middle-class gay people.[28] The transgender person-of-color activist and scholar Jessi Gan discusses how mainstream LGBT groups have routinely dismissed or not paid sufficient attention to Rivera's Latina identity, while Puerto Rican and Latino groups have often not fully acknowledged Rivera's contribution to their struggles for civil rights.[11] Tim Retzloff has discussed this issue with respect to the omission of discussions about race and ethnicity in mainstream U.S. LGBT history, particularly with regard to Rivera's legacy.[29]\n\nGender identity[edit]\nRivera's gender identity was complex and varied throughout her life.[6][2] In 1971, she spoke of herself as a \"half sister\".[30] In her essay \"Transvestites: Your Half Sisters and Half Brothers of the Revolution\", she specifically claims her use of transvestite as applying to only the gay community: \"Transvestites are homosexual men and women who dress in clothes of the opposite sex.\"[30]\nIn interviews and writings in her later years, notably her 1995 interview with Randy Wicker and her 2002 essay, \"Queens In Exile, The Forgotten Ones,\" she expressed a fluid take on gender and sexuality, referring to herself alternately as a gay man,[4] a gay girl,[2] a drag queen/street queen,[6][7][8] and again as a gay man,[6] embodying all of these experiences and seeing none of these identities as excluding the others.[6]  Rivera writes of having considered gender reassignment surgery much earlier in life, but of ultimately choosing to reject it, taking hormones only near the end of her life.[6]\n\nI left home at age 10 in 1961. I hustled on 42nd Street. The early 60s was not a good time for drag queens, effeminate boys or boys that wore makeup like we did. Back then we were beat up by the police, by everybody. I didn't really come out as a drag queen until the late 60s when drag queens were arrested, what degradation there was. I remember the first time I got arrested, I wasn't even in full drag. I was walking down the street and the cops just snatched me.[31]\nPeople now want to call me a lesbian because I'm with Julia,[32] and I say, \"No. I'm just me. I'm not a lesbian.\" I'm tired of being labeled. I don't even like the label transgender. I'm tired of living with labels. I just want to be who I am. I am Sylvia Rivera. Ray Rivera left home at the age of 10 to become Sylvia. And that's who I am.[6]\nDeath[edit]\nRivera died during the dawn hours of February 19, 2002, at St. Vincent's Hospital, of complications from liver cancer.[1] Activist Riki Wilchins noted, \"In many ways, Sylvia was the Rosa Parks of the modern transgender movement, a term that was not even coined until two decades after Stonewall\".[33]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n Street sign in New York City's Greenwich Village, named in Rivera\u2019s honor\nAs an active member of the Metropolitan Community Church of New York, Rivera ministered through the Church's food pantry, which provides food to hungry people. As well, recalling her life as a child on the streets, she remained a passionate advocate for queer youth. MCC New York has a food pantry called the Sylvia Rivera Food Pantry, and its queer youth shelter is called Sylvia's Place, both in her honor.[34]\nSeason 1, episode 1 and Season 3, episode 1 of the podcast \u201cMaking Gay History\u201d are about her.[35][36]\nNamed in her honor (and established in 2002), the Sylvia Rivera Law Project is dedicated \"to guarantee that all people are free to self-determine gender identity and expression, regardless of income or race, and without facing harassment, discrimination or violence\".[37]\nIn 2002, actor/comedian Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed Rivera in the well-received solo musical ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 1 (directed by Aliza Washabaugh-Durand and produced by Aliza Washabaugh-Durand and Christopher Durand) winning Rivera renewed national attention.[38]\nIn 2005, the corner of Christopher and Hudson streets was renamed \"Sylvia Rivera Way\" in her honor. This intersection is in Greenwich Village, the neighborhood in New York City where Rivera started organizing, and is only two blocks from the Stonewall Inn.[39]\nIn January 2007, a new musical based upon Rivera's life, Sylvia So Far, premiered in New York at La Mama in a production starring Bianca Leigh as Rivera and Peter Proctor as Marsha P. Johnson. The composer and lyricist is Timothy Mathis (Wallflowers, Our Story Too, The Conjuring), a friend of Rivera's in real life. The show moved off-Broadway in the winter of 2007/2008.[citation needed]\nThe Spring 2007 issue of CENTRO: Journal of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, which was dedicated to \"Puerto Rican Queer Sexualities\" and published at Hunter College, included a special dossier on Rivera, including a transcription of a talk by Rivera from 2001 as well as two academic essays exploring the intersections of Rivera's trans and Latina identities.[11][14][29] The articles in this journal issue complement other essays by Puerto Rican scholars who have also emphasized Rivera's pioneering role.[40][41]\nIn 2014, The Social Justice Hub at The New School\u2019s newly opened University Center was named the Baldwin Rivera Boggs Center after activists James Baldwin, Sylvia Rivera, and Grace Lee Boggs.[42]\nIn 2015, a portrait of Rivera was added to the National Portrait Gallery, making Rivera the first transgender activist to be featured in the gallery.[43]\nIn 2016, Rivera was inducted into the Legacy Walk.[44]\nIn 2018, Happy Birthday, Marsha! a short film about Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, set in the hours before the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, was released.[45]\nA large, painted mural depicting Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson went on display in Dallas, Texas in 2019 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. The painting of the \"two pioneers of the gay rights movement\" in front of a transgender flag claims to be the world's largest mural honoring the trans community.[46]\nIn May 2019, it was announced that LGBT rights activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera would be commemorated with a monument in New York's Greenwich Village, near the epicenter of the historic Stonewall riots. The monument was publicly announced on May 30, in honor of the 50th anniversary of Stonewall and just in time for Pride month.[47]\nIn June 2019, the Italian city of Livorno dedicated a green area to Rivera, called Parco Sylvia Rivera.[48]\nIn June 2019, Rivera was one of the inaugural fifty American \u201cpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\u201d inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn.[49][50] The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history,[51] and the wall\u2019s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.[52]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Puerto Ricans\nStorm\u00e9 DeLarverie\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Dunlap, David W.

When she was sixteen, she met a neighbor who was transgender and who introduced her to feminizing hormones. By the age of twenty-one she was living as a woman.

She took her nom de plume from a character in Italy's Diabolik comics, Eva Kant, and writer Harold Robbins.

Her father died of suicide when she was three years old, and her maternal grandfather, Anthony Oliveto, acted as a father figure.[13] Living in Manassas, Virginia, for her whole life, she attended the majority of her schooling there. She went to Loch Lomond Elementary School for grades K-3, and then All Saints School for grades 4\u20138.[11] She then attended Paul VI Catholic High School in Fairfax, Virginia and then went to her aunt and uncle's alma mater, St. Bonaventure University in St. Bonaventure, New York, to pursue journalism.[11] As a student at St. Bonaventure University, she had a 1.1 GPA her first semester and was more focused on music than homework.[14] During her second semester, she made a comeback and raised her GPA to a 3.48 and made the Dean's List.[14] Her professors described her as tenacious, persistent, and one who worked for those whose voices were often ignored.[14] She returned to Virginia after graduation.[13]\nRoem has stated that her role models growing up were Senator Chuck Colgan and Delegate Harry Parrish because, although they were affiliated with a party, they had more independent ideologies.[11]\n\nJournalism career[edit]\nWhen Roem was a child, her grandfather would tell her, \"the basis of my knowledge comes from reading the newspaper every day.\"[11] This influenced her to become a journalist.[11] She was a journalist for ten and a half years. Her first job out of college, in 2006, was at the Gainesville Times in Gainesville, Virginia.[11] As Dan Roem, she was lead reporter for the Gainesville Times and Prince William Times. She then went to work as a news editor in August 2015 at the Montgomery County Sentinel in Rockville, Maryland, where she was employed until December 2016.[11] She then decided to run for public office.[11] She said her journalism career has given her a wide knowledge of policy issues.[15] She won awards[which?] from the Virginia Press Association seven times.[12]\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nFreedom of the press[edit]\nIn 2020, Roem, a former journalist, co-sponsored a bill (HB 36) to protect freedom of the press. The bill would affirmatively protect the free-speech rights of student journalists at public schools and prohibit school administration from censoring their work unless it is defamatory, violates federal law, or is likely to spur unlawful acts of violence. The bill was co-sponsored in the House by Chris Hurst and has a companion bill in the Senate which was introduced by David Marsden.\n[16] The bill was introduced in response to multiple instances of schools censoring journalism by students on campus, which is permitted under the 1988 Supreme Court ruling Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier.[17] Similar bills have been introduced by Roem and other General Assembly members in three previous legislative sessions but have failed to advance.\n\nPolitical career[edit]\n2017 election[edit]\nMain article: 2017 Virginia House of Delegates election\nRoem first became interested in politics in 2004 following President George W. Bush's proposal to add a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.[18] After that, she was interested in looking into how the government operates and how she could change it.[18]\nRoem was recruited to run for the Virginia House of Delegates by her local Democratic Party and specifically Delegate Rip Sullivan, the recruiting chair for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus.[19][20] She states that she had never considered running, but it did not take a lot of convincing.[20] In 2017, a first-time candidate, Roem challenged Republican Bob Marshall, who was a 13-term incumbent representative.[21] Marshall is a self-described \"chief homophobe\" and was a sponsor on Virginia's bill to end same-sex marriage and Virginia's bathroom bill.[21][22]\nRoem was endorsed by the Victory Fund, EMILY's List, Run for Something, Virginia's List, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee[23][12] and was able to raise $500,000 in donations, much of it coming from LGBTQ+ supporters and other national allies, out raising her opponent 3-to-1.[7] Her campaign knocked on more than 75,000 doors in a district with only 52,471 voters.[7] Her campaign faced significant transphobic discrimination. Marshall consistently attacked Roem's gender identity through his advertisements.[7] She was also attacked by a conversion therapy advocate, who stated that Roem was trans because her father committed suicide and her grandfather failed to serve as an adequate role model for her.[19] Roem stated that she never wanted the focus to be about her gender, and instead focused mainly on traffic issues in the district that she had faced.[19][24]\nRoem ran as a Democrat in the 2017 election for the 13th District of the Virginia House of Delegates against Republican incumbent Bob Marshall, who had held the office for the previous 25 years.[2][25] In January 2017, Marshall introduced the \"Physical Privacy Act\" (HB 1612), a bathroom bill which died in committee two weeks later in January.[26] Marshall has referred to himself as Virginia's \"chief homophobe\".[27][28][29][30]\nRoem declared her candidacy in January 2017.[31] She received endorsements from the Victory Fund[32] and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.[33] Between April 1 and June 1, Roem received 1,064 donations of under $100, the highest of any delegate candidate in the state other than Chris Hurst.[34]  Roem's platform was based on economic and transportation issues,[35][36] centered on a promise to fix Virginia State Route 28.[37]\nIn July 2017, following President Donald Trump's announcement of a ban on transgender people serving in the U.S. military, Roem received a $50,000 donation from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele.[35][38]\nIn August 2017, Roem received an endorsement from the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).[39] In October 2017, she was endorsed by former Vice President Joe Biden.[40]\nIn September 2017, Roem posted a web video entitled \"Inspire\", criticizing her opponent's refusal to debate her or to refer to her as a woman. In the video, she says \"There are millions of transgender people in the country, and we all deserve representation in government.\"[25]\nIn October 2017, Roem's campaign received reports that residents of her district were receiving anti-transgender robocalls. Roem said the calls were being made by the American Principles Project, which has circulated a petition to \"Stop Transgender Medical Experimentation on Children\".[41][42] Also in October 2017, the Republican Party of Virginia mailed campaign fliers attacking comments Roem made during a September radio interview. Although the fliers, approved by Roem's opponent, used male pronouns to refer to Roem, the party's executive director dismissed the idea that they were attacking Roem's gender identity.[43]\nOver the course of the campaign, she out-raised Marshall by a 5 to 1 margin, collecting over $370,000, including over 4,100 small-dollar donations from Progressive Change Campaign Committee members.[25]\n\nResults[edit]\n2017 Democratic primary\n\n2017 Democratic primary for Virginia district 13[44]\n\n\nCandidate\n\nVotes\n\nPercentage\n\n\nDanica A.

Additionally, Roem serves as a member in both the Transportation Innovation and General Topics Subcommittee and Transportation Systems Subcommittee in the Transportation Committee.\n\nAwards and recognition[edit]\nIn December 2018, the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, the District of Columbia's largest local LGBT political group, honored Roem with its Justice Award.[49]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRoem was a vocalist in the melodic death metal band Cab Ride Home.[23] She first got interested in metal music in high school, and viewed metal music as her rebellion.[24] Her band has performed 120 shows and has toured in the United Kingdom.[50] During her campaign, her Republican opponent said that her \"eccentric music videos\" led her to be \"out of touch with the district's suburban sensibilities\" and not fit for the position.[21]\nIn her free time, Roem practices yoga and spends time with her boyfriend and his 9-year-old daughter.[19] Roem said that she does not discuss them much because she does not want them to face the same discrimination that she has faced.[19] She lives in Manassas, Virginia.[3] Her stepchild attends public school and she has been active in her stepchild's school board.[12] Roem has also stated that she is considering writing a book.[19]\n\nTransition[edit]\nIn 2012, Roem started her transition and on December 3, 2013 she began hormone replacement therapy.[11] She described her friends and co-workers as very supportive during her transition, stating that \"no one cared. It was great. I could just keep doing my job\".[11] In 2015, she changed her name to Danica.[11][50] Growing up she often felt like she had no one to talk to about the way she was feeling about her gender and it wasn't until she left for college that she started to explore her identity.[24] While at college, though, she described her struggle with gender dysphoria as \"suffocating\" and would often not leave her room for days.[14] She won her university's gender buster award, and received negative responses due to it in her school's student newspaper.[12] Due to this, she did not feel comfortable coming out during that time.[12]\nDuring her campaign, Marshall tried to use her gender identity against her by not using her personal pronouns and refusing to debate her.[25] Marshall also stated that she was not a real woman because she will never be able to get cervical or ovarian cancer.[25] Roem responded by releasing a video stating that her \"identity shouldn't be a big deal. This is just who I am.\"[25] Throughout her campaign and now as an elected official, she has received many positive and inspiring messages from trans individuals from all around the country.[51] While very comfortable with her gender identity, she realizes the severity of the current political climate, and has stated that she strives to never make anyone uncomfortable around her because of her gender identity.[19] Roem has said that she is proud to be a trans woman, and that she \"never ran away from her identity. Ever. [She] owned it immediately, and [she] celebrated it.[24]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Althea Garrison served a term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives after being outed subsequent to winning her election in 1992.[5] Stacie Laughton was elected in 2012 to the New Hampshire House of Representatives while openly transgender, but did not serve her term.[6]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Moreau, Julie (June 12, 2017). \"Will 2017 be the \"Year of the Trans Candidate\"?\".

Rogers developed a technically highly proficient ventriloquism act with her ventriloquist figure Shorty Harris, first of all appearing as a supporting act in music hall in the 1950s. Like her fellow ventriloquist Bobbie Kimber, she began life as a man.  She underwent gender reassignment surgery on the National Health Service in the early 1960s. This brought her some short-lived notoriety but did not hamper her career. Rogers won acclaim for her appearance in the 1968 review Boys Will be Girls at the Theatre Royal Stratford East and went on to become a highly regarded performer on the UK cabaret circuit. She was the only variety act ever to appear at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. From 1974 onwards she was a regular, though somewhat incongruous, guest on TV on The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. She also appeared on BBC TV's long running Music Hall variety show, The Good Old Days. Her cabaret career eventually extended internationally including appearances at Las Vegas and The Magic Castle in Hollywood, and on United States TV.\nHer work as a magician was always something of a sideline but she was an ingenious developer of magic tricks including illusions for David Copperfield and Paul Daniels. She was an expert on \"topology\", the art of creating illusions with shapes, and wrote three standard texts on the subject. She was particularly known for illusions with Borromean Rings.\nRogers died in London after a series of strokes. She was survived by her life partner Val Andrews, also a magician.\n\nPublications[edit]\nRogers published a number of magic effects and books, predominantly through specialist magic publisher Martin Breese. These include:\n\nThe Little Book of Ventriloquism (c.1948)\nTerri Rogers' Star Gate (1985)\nBoromian Link (1986)\nWipe Out (1986)\nWord of Mind (1986)\nSecrets (1986)\nMore Secrets (1988)\nTop Secrets (1998)\nIn addition to these books, Rogers sold several manufactured tricks, including The Key and BlockBuster.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\"Terri Rogers: Obituary\".

For her collegiate studies, she attended the University of the Philippines Diliman. She managed to secure a scholarship to pursue journalism at the University of the Basque Country in Spain and attained two master's degrees.[9] She worked in Spain as a senior editor for the Spanish News Agency before returning to the Philippines in 2012 to take care of her father, who was seriously ill by that time.[8]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nCongress[edit]\nDuring the 2016 Philippine elections, Roman ran under the Liberal Party banner for the position of 1st District Representative for Bataan in the House of Representatives. She competed against Hermosa mayor Danilo Malana of Aksyon Demokratiko and won with more than 62% of the total votes and became the first ever transgender congresswoman in the Congress of the Philippines. Roman succeeded the incumbent, her mother Hermina Roman, who had a limited term.[7]\nShe, along with other elected lawmakers (collectively known as \"equality champs\"), launched the passage of the anti-discrimination bill on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity (now known as the SOGIE Equality Bill) through a speech in the House of Representatives that garnered international support for LGBT rights in the Philippines.[10] She also filed bills regarding eco-tourism, livelihood enhancements, agriculture advancements, health, and education, which were the advocacies of her family, and were focused on the first district of Bataan. She was named as one of the \"13 Inspiring Women of 2016\" by Time magazine in October 2016.[11][12] She left the Liberal Party in May 2017 and transferred to PDP\u2013Laban, the current ruling political party of the Philippines, to hasten the House passage of the bills that she supported.[1] In September 2017, the SOGIE Equality Bill passed unanimously in the House of Representatives, after 17 years of political limbo, with no lawmakers voting against it. In January 2018, Roman, along with the House Speaker, filed House Bill 6595 (the Civil Partnership Bill), which seeks to legalize civil unions, regardless of gender.[13] In February, Roman became the first transgender official of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.[14] In August 2018, she filed the Regional Investment and Infrastructure Council Act, which sought to create special economic zones in Luzon.[15] In September, Roman became the first committee chair of the newly created House Committee on Disaster Management.[16] In October, she again pushed for the same-sex civil union bill, adding that the \"sky will not fall\" if the bill is passed.[17] During the same month, she filed her certificate of candidacy for reelection in her district.[18] In November 2018, during the first meeting of the House Committee on Disaster Management which she chairs, Roman prioritized the rehabilitation of the war-torn Islamic City of Marawi.[19]\nIn the 2019 Philippine elections, Roman ran under the PDP\u2013Laban banner for the position of 1st District Representative for Bataan in the House of Representatives. She competed against Emelita Justo Lubag of Katipunan ng Demokratikong Pilipino and won with 91% of the total votes.\n\nCommittee Memberships[edit]\nVeterans Affairs and Welfare, Chairperson\nWomen and Gender Equality, Vice Chairperson\nAppropriations, Member of the Majority\nClimate Change, Member of the Majority\nPoverty Alleviation, Member of the Majority\nSustainable Development Goals, Member of the Majority\nHouse Measures Authored[edit]\nHB05225\nAN ACT MANDATING THE PROVISION OF FREE WI-FI INTERNET ACCESS IN PUBLIC AREAS\nStatus: Republic Act RA10929 enacted on 2017-08-02\n\nHB05563\nAN ACT DECLARING APRIL 21 OF EVERY YEAR A SPECIAL NONWORKING HOLIDAY IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF ORANI, PROVINCE OF BATAAN, IN COMMEMORATION OF ITS FOUNDING ANNIVERSARY, TO BE KNOWN AS \"ORANI FOUNDATION DAY\"\nStatus: Republic Act RA11145 enacted on 2018-11-09\n\nHB06178\nAN ACT DECLARING JANUARY 11 OF EVERY YEAR A SPECIAL NONWORKING HOLIDAY IN THE PROVINCE OF BATAAN IN COMMEMORATION OF ITS FOUNDING ANNIVERSARY, TO BE KNOWN AS \" BATAAN FOUNDATION DAY \"\nStatus: Republic Act RA11138 enacted on 2018-11-09\n\nHB07525\nAN ACT INCREASING THE MONTHLY PENSION OF SENIOR VETERANS THEREBY AMENDING RA 6948, AS AMENDED\nStatus: Republic Act RA11164 enacted on 2018-12-20\n\nHB08636\nAN ACT INSTITUTIONALIZING A NATIONAL INTEGRATED CANCER CONTROL PROGRAM AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR\nStatus: Republic Act RA11215 enacted on 2019-02-14\n\nHB08794\nAN ACT DEFINING GENDER-BASED SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN STREETS, PUBLIC SPACES, ONLINE, WORKPLACES, AND EDUCATIONAL OR TRAINING INSTITUTIONS, PROVIDING PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND PRESCRIBING PENALTIES THEREFOR\nStatus: Republic Act RA11313 enacted on 2019-04-17\n\nPolitical positions[edit]\nFederalism[edit]\nRoman expressed her support for a federal form of government in the Philippines, but stated that she will introduce a clause that aims to guarantee the country's territorial integrity as she perceives that a federal system without such clause will lead to separatism due to the country's various ethnic groups, geographies, and regionalism. She cited the Spanish federal system as a possible reference for the Philippines' federal prospects.[20]\n\nHabeas corpus[edit]\nRoman voted to approve a bill to reinstate the death penalty in the Philippines during its final reading on March 29, 2017, which met criticism online. She explained that she needed to compromise in order for her other advocacies and projects to push through. Earlier, she expressed opposition to the bill and called for the respect of the rights of convicts for reformation. Roman held a survey to gauge the views of her constituents in first district of Bataan and 85 percent of participants in a survey she conducted favored death penalty.[21]\n\nSame-sex marriage[edit]\nRoman is the vice-chairperson of the Women And Gender Equality Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives.[22] She supports same-sex civil unions for the Philippines, but said the first priority should be an anti-discrimination law, followed by a revision of the family code. She believes that at the present time, a marriage equality bill will not pass in Congress, due to the present status quo, which is why campaigning for it should be a top priority in the coming decades. In September 2017, the SOGIE Equality Bill passed in the House. In late 2017, Roman filed a civil union bill that caters to both heterosexual couples and non-heterosexual couples. The bill is backed by the majority of lawmakers in the House of Representatives, including the House Speaker.[23]\n\nHealth services[edit]\nRoman is a member of the Health Committee of the House of Representatives.[22] She has filed a Cancer Institute bill in the House which was passed into law last February of this year as well as a Caregiver's bill. Roman supports the Mental Health Law, which was passed in 2017. She has filed a Hospitals Classification Bill which seeks to standardize the equipment, facilities, and services of hospitals on the basis of their level of classification.\n\nWar veterans' rights[edit]\nRoman is an advocate for war veteran rights in the Philippines. She is the incumbent Chairperson for the Veteran Affairs and Welfare Committee in the House of Representatives. She has filed a bill seeking to increase the monthly pension of Filipino war veterans.[22]\n\nTourism[edit]\nRoman is an avid fan of history, culture, and the environment. She stated that her love for culture and the environment developed at home and was polished during her almost 20 years of stay in Spain, where she learned a lot about history and received two master's degrees. She has filed bills for the protection and conservation of numerous tourist sites in the first district of Bataan.[24]\n\nEducation[edit]\nRoman supports higher education in the Philippines. She has filed the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Students (UNIFAST) bill in the House of Representatives. Additionally, she has filed a bill which seeks to mandate the government to open all of its books to the people via online library.[24]\n\nIndigenous people's rights[edit]\nRoman has filed a bill seeking to increase the representation of indigenous peoples in the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, which is near her home province of Bataan.\n\nAgriculture and aquaculture[edit]\nRoman has filed bills on the sustainability of agriculture and aquaculture in the province of Bataan. She has also filed the re-allotment of public lands and urban lands for agricultural lands.[24]\n\nMilitary career[edit]\nRoman is the first transgender military officer and reservist of the Armed Forces of the Philippines commissioned as Lieutenant Colonel.[25][26][27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn the 1990s, Roman underwent sex reassignment surgery at age 26 in New York City and had her name legally changed. She was encouraged by Jesuit priests at her school, who said \"Geraldine, the body's just a shell.\" Her gender was legally changed to \"female\" through a judicial process.[8][6]\nRoman's partner is a Spanish man in Spain; they are not married.[28] Aside from her native Tagalog, she also speaks English, Spanish, French and Italian.[citation needed] She is member of the Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language. She is a practicing Catholic.[29]\n\nAwards and recognitions[edit]\n100 Leading Global Thinkers of 2016 by US-based Foreign Policy magazine[4]\nPart of \"Inspiring Women of 2016\" list by Time magazine[30]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Yellow no more: Roman, 3 other LP lawmakers jumping ship to PDP\u2013Laban\".

A self-taught computer coder, she went on to become founder and CEO of TransTech Social Enterprises, a firm that helps employ transgender people in the tech industry.[1][2]\nRoss began her acting career in the web series Her Story (2016), after which she received further recognition and critical acclaim for her starring roles in the FX drama series Pose (2018\u20132019) and the FX anthology horror series American Horror Story (2019\u2013present).\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Activism\n4 Personal life\n5 Filmography\n\n5.1 Film\n5.2 Television\n\n\n6 Awards and nominations\n\n6.1 Honors\n\n\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nAngelica Ross was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, then raised to the north in nearby Racine.[3] Ross, a trans woman, has said she was perceived as feminine from a young age.[1][4] In 1998, when she was seventeen, she came out as gay to her mother, an evangelical Christian. Her mother did not receive the news well as, according to Ross, \"she told me I should commit suicide or she would, because she couldn't have someone like me as her child.\"[1][5] Ross considered ending her own life and overdosed on medication but survived.[1][4]\nUpon graduating high school at 17, Ross briefly attended the University of Wisconsin\u2013Parkside before dropping out after one semester.[3] Ross decided to join the U.S. Navy (after her parents signed a waiver so that she could join as a minor) in order to qualify for the G.I. Bill. Ross initially moved to Rochester, New York, before being stationed in Yokosuka, Kanagawa.[3] After six months of service, she requested and received an \"uncharacterized\" discharge under the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy (which was then in force) due to being harassed by enlisted men who coerced her into saying she was gay.[4][5]\nRoss moved back home, and made friends with a drag queen called Traci Ross who helped her begin her gender transition at the age of 19.[3] Upon discovering that she was transitioning, her parents threw her out and Ross moved in with her biological father (who was slightly more accepting of her) in Roanoke, Virginia.[3][5] Although Ross and her parents were estranged for a time, she states that their relationship has since been mended.[5] During the six years that she lived in Roanoke, Ross worked as a waitress at Applebee's so that she could earn enough money to pay rent and attend cosmetology school. She was let go from her waitress job due to discrimination.[3] Ross then moved to Hollywood, Florida and worked as a model and escort, then web manager, until 2003.[5] She started a web development and graphic design business and took acting classes.[5] She later moved to Chicago to become the employment coordinator for the Trans Life Center.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2005, Ross made her acting debut in the comedy film Natale a Miami, followed by a role in the short film Bella Maddo (2010). In 2016, Ross received recognition for starring in Her Story, a web series about trans women in Los Angeles.[1][6] The series was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama.[7][8] In 2017, she made guest appearances in the CBS legal drama series Doubt, the TNT crime drama series Claws, and the Prime Video comedy-drama series Transparent.[9] She also executive produced and starred in the short film Missed Connections, which went on to be an official selection at Outfest 2017, Baltimore International Black Film Festival 2017, La Femme International Film Festival 2017, and Outflix Film Festival 2017 in Memphis, Tennessee. In June 2017, Ross provided voice work for the Amazon Video animated series Danger & Eggs.[10][11]\nHer breakthrough role came in 2018, as Candy Ferocity in Ryan Murphy's FX drama series Pose. For her performance, she earned critical acclaim.[12] She went on to star as psychologist Donna Chambers in the FX anthology horror series American Horror Story: 1984, which made her the first female transgender actress to secure two series regular roles. The series was also her second collaboration with Murphy.[13] Her performance garnered critical acclaim by fans and critics alike. In February 2020, Murphy announced through an Instragram post that Ross would return as a series regular for the show's tenth season.[14]\nMore recently, she signed a deal with Pigeon to develop its television projects.[15]\n\nActivism[edit]\nRoss launched TransTech Social Enterprises in Chicago in 2014.[2] The nonprofit creative design firm trains and contracts transgender and other workers.[2][16] Melissa Harris-Perry brought more attention to the firm in 2015, choosing Ross as her show's first \"Foot Soldier\" of the year.[2][17] Ross was a featured speaker at the 2015 White House LGBTQ Tech and Innovation Summit.[18] She was also a celebrity ambassador to the 50th Anniversary Stonewall celebration that took place in June 2019 during Pride.[19] On September 20, 2019, Ross hosted the 2020 Presidential Candidate Forum on LGBTQ Issues.[20][21] This made her the first openly transgender person to host an American presidential forum.[22] On September 28, 2019, Ross was a featured speaker at the National Trans Visibility March in Washington D.C.[23][24]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRoss was once engaged, but called off the engagement as her fianc\u00e9 did not want others to know that Ross was transgender.[25] She is a practicing Buddhist.[1]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2005\n\nNatale a Miami\n\nSharon\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nBella Maddo\n\nParty Guest\n\nShort film\n\n\n2017\n\nMissed Connections\n\nJennifer\n\nShort film\n\n\n2017\n\nThe Heart of a Woman\n\nTerri\n\nShort film\n\n\n2020\n\nDisclosure: Trans Lives on Screen\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary film\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2015\n\nI Am Cait\n\nHerself\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n2016\n\nHer Story\n\nPaige\n\n5 episodes\n\n\n2017\n\nDoubt\n\nValentina\n\nEpisode: \"Clean Burn\"\n\n\n2017\n\nDanger & Eggs\n\nMayor (voice)\n\n3 episodes\n\n\n2017\n\nClaws\n\nRelevance\n\n3 episodes\n\n\n2017\n\nTransparent\n\nDiana Ross Diva\n\nEpisode: \"Born Again\"\n\n\n2018\u20132019\n\nPose\n\nCandy Ferocity\n\nMain role; 14 episodes\n\n\n2019\n\nKing Ester\n\nDenise\n\nEpisode: \"Insurance\"\n\n\n2019\n\nAmerican Horror Story: 1984\n\nRita / Donna Chambers\n\nMain role; 9 episodes[26]\n\n\n2021\n\nAmerican Horror Story\n\nTBA\n\nUpcoming season\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAssociation\n\nCategory\n\nNominated work\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\n2015\n\nTransgender National Alliance\n\nBe Amazing Award\n\nHerself\n\nWon\n\n[27]\n\n\n2016\n\nBlack Trans Advocacy Awards\n\nTrailblazer Award\n\nHerself\n\nWon\n\n[28]\n\n\n2016\n\nHuman Rights Campaign\n\nVisibility Award\n\nHerself\n\nWon\n\n[29]\n\n\n2017\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nOutstanding Talk Show Episode\n\nThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah\n\nWon\n\n[30]\n\n\n2017\n\nSpecial Recognition Award\n\nHerself\n\nWon\n\n[31]\n\n\n2018\n\nFinancial Times\n\nTop 10 LGBT+ Executives\n\nHerself\n\nWon\n\n[32]\n\nHonors[edit]\nIn 2015, Ross was named \"1st Foot Soldier of the Year\" by Melissa Harris-Perry[33]\nIn June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, an event widely considered a watershed moment in the modern LGBTQ rights movement, Queerty named her one of the Pride50 \"trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people\".[34]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i Dawn Ennis (November 17, 2015). \"Meet the Vanguard: Trans Businesswoman Angelica Ross Tells All\".

She was also the CEO of GeoStar and the creator of SiriusXM Satellite Radio.[7] She was the top earning CEO in the biopharmaceutical industry in 2018.[8]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Aviation\n2.2 Sustainable building\n\n\n3 Personal life\n\n3.1 Social activism\n\n\n4 Reception\n5 Bibliography\n6 Filmography\n7 References\n8 Further reading\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn as Martin Rothblatt to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist,[2] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[9][10]\nRothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles.  It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications.[11] She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.\nAs an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's \"High Frontier\" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar.  Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).\nDuring her four-year J.D./M.B.A. program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries.  She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\nUpon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint J.D./M.B.A. degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as vice president by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[13]\nRothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[14] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) board of trustees.[15]\nIn 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement his PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[16]\nRothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[17] \nRothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[18][19]\nShe then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[20]\nAs an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[6][21]\nRothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[22] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[16]  That same year, she says, she had sex reassignment surgery.[23] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[24] \nIn 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[25] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On December 5, 2017, North Carolina State University conferred her an honorary Doctor of Sciences degree.[26]  On May 11, 2010, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[27] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[28]\nAs of April 2018, Rothblatt earned a compensation package worth $37.1 million from United Therapeutics.[29] The majority of the compensation package is for stock options.[8]\nOn May 16, 2018, Martine Rothblatt and Didi Chuxing President Jean Liu were awarded Doctors of Commercial Science degrees, honoris causa, at NYU's 186th Commencement at Yankee Stadium.[30][third-party source needed] In 2019 she was recognised as one of Business Insider's most powerful LGBTQ+ people in tech.[31]\nIn 2018, the University of Victoria's Chair in Transgender Studies, Founder and Academic Director of the Transgender Archives, nominated Martine for an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) from the University of Victoria, located in Victoria, British Columbia.[32] She was officially awarded this on November 13, 2019, at the 10:00am graduation ceremony.[33]\n\nAviation[edit]\n (L-R) United Therapeutics CEO Martine Rothblatt, OC Helicopters Pilot Ric Webb, Tier 1 Engineering President Glen Dromgoole, United Therapeutics Executive Vice President Paul Mahon before a flight test at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.\nIn September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[34] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, president of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[35] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[36]\nOn February 16, 2017, Rothblatt's electric helicopter established new world records of a 30-minute duration flight and an 800-foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[37]  At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries.  On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T.  This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[38]  On December 7, 2018, Rothblatt earned certification in the Guinness Book of World Records for the farthest distance travelled (56.82 kilometers) by an electric helicopter.[39][40]\nRothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification.  She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[11]   In 2018, Rothblatt received the American Helicopter Museum and Education Center Annual Achievement Award for innovation in rotary-wing flight.[41][42]  In 2019, she received the inaugural UP Leadership Award for her advances in eVTOL technology.[43][44]\n\nSustainable building[edit]\nIn September 2018 Rothblatt inaugurated the world's largest site net-zero office building, called the Unisphere, containing 210,000 square feet of space in Silver Spring, Maryland, powered, heated and cooled completely from on-site sustainable energy technologies.[45][46][47]  This office building uses 1 MW of solar panels, fifty-two geothermal wells, a quarter mile long earth labyrinth and electrochromic glass to operate with a zero carbon footprint while graphically communicating its net energy status in real time to the building occupants.[45][47]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[1][2][3][48][49] Rothblatt and Aspen each had a child from a previous relationship and legally adopted each other's children; they went on to have two more children together.[50][51]\nIn 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.[52]\n\nSocial activism[edit]\nIn 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a \"Terasem Island\" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[53] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.\nRothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act or HB-2 law.[54]\nThrough her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about \"the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality\" and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.\nRothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[55] but lost.[56] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[57][58][59]\n\nReception[edit]\nLawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can \"preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology\". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of \"longevity products\".[60]\nRhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[61] Carrico later criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and \"mindclones\" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[62] Carrico went on to criticize Rothblatt for caring more about rights of \"virtual, uploaded persons\"\u2014who he argues are neither real nor possible\u2014more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[63]\nDescribing a conversation with BINA48, one of \"humanity's first cybernetic companions,\" created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics, journalist Amy Harmon concluded it was \"not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects.\"[64]\nIn September 2017 Forbes magazine named Rothblatt one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds of the past century, with special reference to her roles as a \"perpetual reinventor, founder of Sirius and United Therapeutics, and creator of PanAmSat.\"[65]\nIn January 2018 Rothblatt was presented the UCLA Medal, the university's highest award, in recognition of her creation of Sirius XM satellite radio, advancing organ transplant technology, and having \"expanded the way we understand fundamental concepts ranging from communication to gender to the nature of consciousness and mortality.\"[66]\nIn 2019, Rothblatt received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Sir Peter Jackson during the International Achievement Summit in New York City.[67][68]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nRadiodetermination Satellite Services and Standards, Artech House, 1987, ISBN\u00a00-89006-239-0 (communications satellite technology)\nApartheid of Sex: a Manifesto on the Freedom of Gender, Crown, 1995 ISBN\u00a00-517-59997-X (transgenderism)\nFrom Transgender to Transhuman: a Manifesto on the Freedom of Form, Martine Rothblatt, 2011, ISBN\u00a00615489427\nUnzipped Genes, Temple University Press, 1997 ISBN\u00a01-56639-522-4 (bioethics and biopolitics)\nYour Life or Mine, Ashgate, 2003 ISBN\u00a00-7546-2391-2 (xenotransplantation)\nTwo Stars for Peace, iUniverse, 2003 ISBN\u00a00-595-65982-9 (Middle East peace process)\nVirtually Human, St. Martin's Press, 2014 ISBN\u00a01-250-04663-7 (artificial intelligence)\nFilmography[edit]\nRothblatt is the executive producer of the following films:\n\n2B, Transformer Films, 2009.

She received a Bachelor of Science in biology and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from University of Rochester in 1968 and later a Ph.D. in biology from Harvard University in 1971. In 1998, Roughgarden came out as transgender and changed her name to Joan, making a coming out post on her website on her 52nd birthday.[1]\n\nTeaching[edit]\nRoughgarden worked as an instructor and Assistant Professor of Biology at the University of Massachusetts Boston from 1970 to 1972. In 1972 she joined the faculty of the Department of Biology at Stanford University. After becoming full professor she retired in 2011, and became Emeritus Professor. She founded and directed the Earth Systems Program at Stanford and has received awards for service to undergraduate education. In 2012 she moved to Hawaii, where she became an adjunct professor at the Hawai\u02bbi Institute of Marine Biology. In her academic career, Roughgarden advised 20 Ph.D and 15 postdoctoral students.[2]\n\nWriting and research[edit]\nRoughgarden has authored books and over 180 scientific articles. In addition to a textbook on ecological and evolutionary theory in 1979, Roughgarden has carried out ecological field studies with Caribbean lizards and with barnacles and their larvae along the California coast. In her 2004 book, Evolution\u2019s Rainbow, Joan analyzes how biology can influence sexuality and gender identity and emphasizes the substantial diversity within categories like gay, lesbian, and trans. The main point of her book is to be a critique to Darwin's theory of sexual selection.[3]\nAn article published by her lab on these ideas received criticism in the pages of the journal Science. Forty scientists produced ten critical letters, some of which were vitriolic.[4] However, Roughgarden, quoted as being \"not altogether surprised\" by the volume of dissent, argued that her team had replied to most of the criticisms.[5]\nIn her 2009 book The Genial Gene, the case against sexual selection theory is continued and social selection theory presented as an alternative. It lists 26 phenomena not explained by current sexual-selection theory that are better explained by social selection. According to Roughgarden, sexual selection theory derives from a view of natural behavior predicated on the selfish-gene concept, competition and deception, whereas the social-selection theory derives from teamwork, honesty, and genetic equality. As of 2012 she has continued to study if social selection as opposed to sexual selection is a more important driver of evolution for colonial species such as corals or perhaps humans.[6][7]\nRoughgarden has written on the relationship between Christianity and science.[8] Her book Evolution and Christian Faith: Reflections of an Evolutionary Biologist presents scripture passages that emphasize her belief that the Bible does not conflict with evolutionary biology and relates Christianity and evolution by asserting that all life is interconnected, as members of a faith community are connected. Roughgarden opposes the theories of creationism and intelligent design, but asserts her belief in God's involvement in evolution.[9] She was a speaker at the Beyond Belief symposium in 2006.[10]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nStonewall Book Award, 2005\nDinkelspiel Award for Undergraduate Teaching, Stanford University,[11] in 1995\nVisiting Research Fellow at the Merton College, University of Oxford, in 1994\nElected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993\nFellow of Guggenheim Foundation in 1985\nUniversity Fellow, Stanford University in 1978\nRoughgarden has served as associate editor of several academic journals, including Philosophy and Theory in Biology (since 2008), American Naturalist (1984\u20131989), Oecologia (1979\u20131982), and Theoretical Population Biology (1975\u20131986). She was the Vice-Chair and Chair of Theoretical Ecology Section of the Ecological Society of America during 2002\u20132003. She has served on the Nonprofit Organization Board for the Oceanic Society (San Francisco), the EPA Science Advisory Board Committee on Valuating the Protection of Ecological Systems and Services, and the science advisory boards of the Pacific Ocean Conservation Network (California), and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (Santa Barbara).[12]\n\nSelected bibliography[edit]\nRoughgarden, J.

Rubin (born 1966) is an American sociologist known for work on transsexualism.[1]\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nRubin earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1988 from University of California, Santa Cruz and a master's degree and Ph.D. in sociology from Brandeis University in 1996. \n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter lecturing at Harvard University from 1996 to 2000, Rubin held one-year assistant professorships at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 2000 and Hamilton College in 2001. He was appointed at Tufts University in the Media & Communications department from 2002-2005, working as a research analyst at Harvard University during that time. Following a one-year position as programs coordinator at Colleges of the Fenway in 2005, Rubin took a position as an instructor at Quincy College in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 2007.\nRubin's work explores the political tensions that emerge from differing worldviews and identities within the LGBT community.[2]\nRubin is known for arguing that the most meaningful division is not between the queer and transsexual communities, but between the transgender and transsexual communities.[3]\nHe has also explored how the \"logic of treatment\" is different for trans men and trans women, outlining the now-outdated use of chemical castration on female-to-male people.[4] Rubin is a thought leader in the movement to distance transsexual political interests from those of the transgender movement as that movement becomes more aligned with the queer movement.[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Ryan, Joelle Ruby (September 22, 2004).

Rubashkyn is a pharmacist, chemist and polyglot; Eliana currently works as a nicotine harm reduction scientist and develops campaigns of support addressed to LGBTI asylum seekers, refugees and intersex persons in New Zealand.[1]\nRubashkyn's gender was recognised under the United Nations' 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.[2] Rubashkyn's case attracted international media and legal attention after her mistreatment following her detention at Hong Kong International Airport because of the lack of congruence between her gender identity and her passport photo,[3][4][5] resulting in several years of statelessness in Hong Kong, and inhumane reclusion into several refuge centers across Yuen Long.\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n\n1.1 Statelessness\n1.2 Marriage\n\n\n2 International response\n3 New Zealand citizenship\n4 References\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRubashkyn was born in Colombia to a Ukrainian Jewish mother who had moved there in the 1970s.[6] She was assigned and raised male but born with an intersex condition known as Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.[7][8][9]\nIn 2011 Rubashkyn obtained her degree in pharmacy and chemistry at the National University of Colombia.,[10] after studying molecular biology in the University of Granada she was granted a scholarship to develop postgraduate studies in public health at the Taipei Medical University, and started at the same time her gender transition in Taiwan.\nWithin a year, hormone replacement therapy changed Rubashkyn's physical appearance dramatically due to her intersex condition, and the Taiwanese immigration authorities required her to update her passport at the closest Colombian consulate before she could begin her second year of master's studies. She travelled to Hong Kong to do so, but when she arrived at Hong Kong International Airport's immigration facility, she was detained for over eight months in several detention and refugee centres because of her ambiguous legal condition.[11][12] suffering from abusive mistreatment and constant sexual abuse and harassment in several of the reclusion centres she lived.[13]\nShe was also restrained in a psychiatric ward of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kowloon, caused by an attempted suicide, after being constantly mistreated and sexually abused.[14][15]\n[16]\nUnable to seek asylum to be granted protection as a refugee in Hong Kong due to that government not having ratified the UN Refugee Convention, she faced deportation, and suffered severe mistreatment in the airport's detention centre.[17]\nRubashkyn currently lives in Auckland, New Zealand, where she was eventually granted asylum as a refugee.\nRubashkyn learned many languages fluently in the refugee centers she lived during 2012, 2013 and 2014.[18]\nShe remained stateless until 3 April 2018, when she was granted with New Zealand citizenship based on her exceptional circumstances[19]\n\nStatelessness[edit]\nIn 2013, the UN sought another country to resettle Eliana because of the lack of protections for LGBT people and refugees in Hong Kong. She refused to contact her home embassy to prevent deportation because of the lack of diplomatic assistance they offered and Eliana became stateless de facto from 30 October 2012.  Eliana's position as a refugee limited the contact she could have with authorities from the governments of Colombia.[20][21][22]\n\nMarriage[edit]\nOn 2 June 2015, Rubashkyn was married in New Zealand to an Israeli man named Itamar.[23][24] The NZ Registrar of Marriages caused some controversy in relation to the solemnisation of her marriage when, in addition to her present legal name, they asked for her dead name to register the marriage.[25]\n\nInternational response[edit]\nWith the help of Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), she was granted refugee status. However, because Hong Kong is not a signatory of the 1951 refugee convention, it did not recognise her as a refugee and sought to deport her to Colombia.\nHer case drew international attention, particularly in Southeast Asia and Colombia, where transgender and intersex people are often persecuted. Her case was also noted in New Zealand, a country known for its stance on equality for LGBT people.[26][27][28]\nOn 16 December 2013, the UN passed a resolution recognising Rubashkyn as woman under the UNHCR refugee system. She became the first gender diverse person recognised as a woman in China or Hong Kong without having undergone a sex reassignment surgery.[29][30]\nIn May 2014, New Zealand accepted Rubashkyn as a refugee and granted her asylum,[31] extending a universal recognition of her gender. Her case was the first in the world in which the gender identity of a person was recognised internationally.[32][33]\nA CNN story about her struggle and a short documentary about her life in Hong Kong won a GLAAD Media Award in May 2015.[34]\n\nNew Zealand citizenship[edit]\nAfter six years of statelessness in April 2018, the government of New Zealand on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Affairs granted the New Zealand citizenship based on her exceptional and unique circumstances.[35]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"ITANZ - Intersex Awareness New Zealand 2019 - Board Members\".\n\n^ Human Rights Campaign 2014. \"Hong Kong recognized Trans woman without Sex reassignment Surgery\".\n\n^ \"Misunderstood and stateless in Hong Kong: A transgender woman's nightmare\".

She relocated to the urban centres of Auckland and Wellington. After doing drag performances while doing compulsory military training and periods working as a nurse and waiter, Rupe moved to Sydney's Kings Cross in the late 1950s.[4] In the 1970s, she became notorious for the sexually tolerant venues she established in Wellington.[2]\nTaking the name of the gypsy Flamenco dancer Carmen Amaya,[5]  Rupe became Australia's first M\u0101ori drag performer and from that time on lived as a woman. A whole range of work followed, including snake-work, hula dancing and prostitution. Carmen never formally worked at Les Girls but over the years did some extremely exciting, well received guest spots. She described how local police treated her: I was locked up in Long Bay about a dozen times. But it made me a stronger person today.[6] An arrest in New Zealand failed to produce a conviction, because drag was not illegal there, unlike in Australia.[6][7]\n\nAutobiography[edit]\nIn 1988 an autobiography was published, outlining her escapades \"from school boy to successful business woman\".\"Having A Ball: My Life\" was written with Paul Martin and published by Benton Ross.[8]\n\nPolitics[edit]\n Carmen Rupe in 2009 in Wellington with Charles Chauvel (left), Grant Robertson, and Maryan Street\nIn Wellington Carmen ran Carmen's International Coffee Lounge and the Balcony strip club. Despite the fact that the law criminialised homosexual acts, Carmen challenged the overt discrimination and prejudice against people in the gay and transgender communities.[9] She was not afraid to speak to the press and was summoned to appear before the Privileges Committee by Prime Minister Robert Muldoon for suggesting some MPs were gay or bisexual.[10]\nIn 1977 she ran for the Wellington mayoralty, with the support of local businessman Sir Bob Jones, with the slogans get in behind and Carmen for mayor[11] and a platform of gay marriage and legalised brothels, though neither of these are local-government matters in New Zealand.[6] Michael Fowler won re-election as Mayor.\n\nLast years[edit]\nRupe returned to Surry Hills, Sydney where she lived the remainder of her life.[12] In 2003 she was inducted into the Variety Hall of Fame.[13] In 2008 she rode her mobility scooter topless at the head of the Decade of the Divas float at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.[6] She was a prominent member of Agender, the New Zealand transgender group.[13]\nRupe died in St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney of kidney failure on 15 December 2011 after a fall and hip surgery earlier in the year, she was 75.[14]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n A green pedestrian light depicting Carmen Rupe on Cuba Street, Wellington\n A green pedestrian light depicting Carmen Rupe on Cuba Street, Wellington\nRupe has been cited as a role model by MP Georgina Beyer, the world's first openly transgender Member of Parliament. Long time friend and ex Grey District Councilor Jacquie Grant MNZM wrote this moving tribute for Carmen and at her Tangi delivered an equally moving Eulogy. .[10][15]\nIn a heartfelt tribute, Sydney Mayor Clover Moore stated that \"Carmen Rupe was an icon for Sydney's Transgender community and a tireless advocate for GLBT rights. She was a quiet achiever who spent decades as a volunteer with many organisations who provided support to some of our cities most vulnerable people. I knew Carmen and was saddened by her passing. She will be missed by the people she touched and the community she was such a strong part of. It is heartening that, in accordance with her wishes, the Carmen Rupe Memorial Trust has been established to raise awareness of some of the issues faced by our GLBT community. This is a fitting tribute to someone who dedicated so much of their life to helping others\"\nWellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown supports erecting a statue of Rupe in Wellington:[16] \"I admired her strength in living her life on her terms and standing up against discrimination.\"[17]\nFour sets of traffic lights along Cuba Street in Wellington's central business district are fitted with green pedestrial lights depicting Rupe. The lights were installed in August 2016 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Homosexual Law Reform Act.[18]\nIn 2020, the short film GURL was released based on Rupe's life.[19] The short film was a prequel to the feature film \"The Book of Carmen\", which is currently in pre-production.[20] The film was directed, produced and written by Mika X.[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Poroporoaki: Carmen \u2013 Hon Tariana Turia\". scoop.co.nz. 2011.

He became a contestant in Bigg Boss 4 in 2010. He broke into the mainstream audiences through his impersonations of late prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and later playing the cross-dressing Begum Nawazish Ali on various television channels, including the Aaj TV network, Dawn News and Geo TV network. His alter ego of Begum Nawazish Ali has now become his primary persona as he rarely appears as the male Ali Saleem. He is a bisexual man born to a retired colonel father in Pakistan Army[1]\nand his wife, a former government official.\nBiologically born a male, Ali has sometimes called himself gay,[2]\nbisexual[3]\nor at other times even a transsexual.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and being Ali Benazir\n2 Birth of Begum Nawazish Ali\n3 Late Night with Begum Nawazish Ali\n\n3.1 Courting controversy\n\n\n4 The Late, Late Show With Ali Saleem\n5 Property disputes with mother\n6 Reality television\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life and being Ali Benazir[edit]\nBorn in Islamabad to a colonel in the Pakistan Army.[1]\nFrom a young age, he desired and fantasized about being a woman.[5]\nIt was in his teens that he got to do a play for Yasmeen Ismail at the Arts Council clad in a burqa offering the audience with his monologue that people saw his inner lady come out. They would flock him and ask him in disbelief of how a child can impersonate a woman older than his age. Ali now says that because his audience was older than his age then, he felt he matured earlier. Ali took his early life education from Cadet College Hasanabdal, Attock and later went to Froebel's International School for A'level[5]\nHis breakthrough in the entertainment industry came when he started imitating his childhood heroine, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto,[2] from the way she talked to the way she dressed. So loved were his performances that on the occasion of Zohaib Hassan's dholki, Bhutto herself asked Ali to impersonate her. Zohaib's sister Nazia had warned Ali not imitate the prime minister. But, eventually, when asked he even made the prime minister Benazir Bhutto burst out in laughter and appreciated the performance.[5]\n\nBirth of Begum Nawazish Ali[edit]\nHis father and mother would soon seek a divorce, during which Ali had to come to the city of Karachi. There he came to terms with Imran Aslam, a political satire writer who would tell him of a television channel in the pipeline, that would later be called Geo TV.[5] Ali's Benazir impressions were famous among his friends and Imran told him to take it to the airways with the television channel once it got aired. A show dealing with political humour around the time of election in the country aptly named Hum Sub Umeed Se Hai (idiomatically translated as We Are All Expecting (Pregnant), but meant to translate as We Are All Hopeful) showed people impersonating the election candidates. Ali did his Benazir act there for the first time on television.[5]\nAfter a while with the act, Ali came to realise that the act alone would not shape his career and he had to do more with his talent. It was from this very act that Ali gained the nickname BB or bibi meaning lady in Urdu.[5] Omar Adil, an orthopaedic surgeon by profession, doctor to Madam Noor Jehan, was a close friend of his. With an extensive research into Pakistani cinema under his belt and ties to multiple television channels, the doctor suggested Ali with the idea of having a dragged-up character as a host for a talk show.[2] Thus, Begum Nawazish was born.\n\nLate Night with Begum Nawazish Ali[edit]\nAli cross-dresses as a woman wearing a sari and asks influential guests provocative questions in his show Late Night with Begum Nawazish Ali. He would invite two guests at a time to be interviewed. The name Begum Nawazish Ali was suggested by Dr. Adil talking of his neighbour with the same name, wife to a colonel. Ali could relate strongly to this persona as an alter ego. The facts that the Begum they created lived a wealthy life living off the money of her late armyman husband and was a socialite, bore resemblance to the life Ali himself had lived in his earlier days.[5] The rights to the show were sold to Aaj TV where the show airs every Saturday night.\n\nCourting controversy[edit]\nThe show has invited the likes of business tycoons, industrialists, actors and actresses, government and religious leaders. Begum would flirt with any one of the male guests \"using suggestive banter and sexual innuendo\".[6]\nIt's just this use of gestures and acts that Begum has earned a nasty reputation amongst the more fundamentalist ideals of the religious leaders (where some are even amused by his show)[7][8]\nbut has still ventured into the hearts and minds of the younger generations. While talking of taboo topics like \"sex\" in Pakistan where it is strictly off-limits even trying to mention it, Ali has been spared a backlash only because when on-the-air he is personifying a woman. Women, however, say that they are still afraid to do what Ali is doing on the show.[6]\nWhere television talk shows in Pakistan are reluctant to take on criticism for the military backed Pakistani government, Begum had always been critical of a general seated as a president.[6] Due to these critical claims, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was opposed to the show's airing. This fair bit of opposition led to the temporary closure of the show.[citation needed] Offers however extended from across the border in India for a follow-up of the show by the name Begum.[9]\nThe reformatted show aired 26 episodes with Indian celebrities on the channel 9X from India.[10]\n\nThe Late, Late Show With Ali Saleem[edit]\nAli Saleem joined DawnNews with his latest show The Late, Late Show with Ali Saleem. Ali Saleem will be hosting the show as himself. The first episode is to be aired on Saturday 26 March 2016. Humayun Saeed, Nadeem Baig and Mehwish Hayat appeared as guests on the first episode.[11]\n\nProperty disputes with mother[edit]\nReportedly on 26 May 2011 Ali Saleem's mother Farzana Saleem called the capital city police and told them that her son has been torturing her. She was immediately taken to the hospital with a broken nose and other injuries on her body while Ali Saleem was taken to police station.[12] Ali told media personal that there was some dispute going on within the family about property.\n\nReality television[edit]\nAs Contestant\n\n\nYear\n\nShow\n\nPlace\n\nChannel\n\n\n2010\n\n Bigg Boss (season 4)\n\n 13th Place  Evicted Day 20\n\nColors\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Walsh, Declan (17 May 2006). \"Pakistan's late night, cross-dressing TV star\".

The Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife Queen Soraya, saw Schmid perform in Hamburg and invited her to Tehran, but Schmid's material and dress were considered inappropriate by many in Iran, and she was forced to devise a new routine. She instead whistled a Strauss polka and Offenbach's \"Barcarole\" for the Shah and his court.[1]\nFollowing her Iran performance, Schmid toured the world as a cross-dressing whistler, performing on stage with acts like Frank Sinatra, \u00c9dith Piaf and Marlene Dietrich while living in Cairo. In 1964, Schmid underwent sex reassignment surgery and changed her name to Jeanette.[3] Schmid moved to Vienna, the world capital of whistling[citation needed], to continue her whistling career.\nSchmid continued to tour the world under the stage name Baroness Lips von Lipstrill, including a successful stint on Broadway.  She was awarded the Austrian Decoration of Merit in Gold in 2004.[2]\nSchmid died in Vienna in 2005.[1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Sieveking, P. (2005). \"Necrolog\", Fortean Times 201, p. 26.

A few years later, she began crossdressing. At first, she crossdressed secretively, but eventually she started identifying herself openly as a \"male crossdresser.\" Serano attended her first support group for crossdressers in 1994 while living in Kansas.[2][3]\nSoon afterward, Serano moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where she met her wife, Dani, in 1998. Around this time, Serano began identifying as not only a crossdresser but also as transgender and bigender. In 2001, she began medically transitioning and identifying as a trans woman.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\n Julia Serano speaks at the GLBT History Museum in San Francisco for the launch of the second edition of Whipping Girl.\nSerano earned her PhD in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from Columbia University. She researched genetics and developmental and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Berkeley for seventeen years.[4][5]\nSerano is the author of Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity. Her second book, Excluded: Making Feminist and Queer Movements More Inclusive, was published on September 10, 2013 by Seal Press.[6] Her third book, Outspoken: A Decade of Transgender Activism and Trans Feminism, she published herself under Switch Hitter Press,[7] which she founded along with Switch Hitter Records.[8] Outspoken is a 2017 Lambda Literary Award finalist.[9]\nHer work has appeared in queer, feminist, and pop-culture magazines, including Bitch, Clamor, Kitchen Sink, LiP, make/shift, and Transgender Tapestry. Excerpts of her work have appeared in The Believer and The San Francisco Chronicle, and on NPR.[10]\nSerano has spoken about transgender and trans women's issues at numerous universities, often at queer-, feminist-, psychology-, and philosophy-themed conferences.[11][12][13][14] Her writings have also been used in teaching materials in gender studies courses across the United States.[15][16]\nSerano is a slam poet, and has given spoken-word performances at universities as well as at events such as the National Queer Arts Festival, San Francisco Pride Dyke March and Trans March stages, Ladyfest, outCRY!, Femme 2006 and in The Vagina Monologues.[17] She was a guitarist and vocalist for the band Bitesize from 1997 through the early 2000s, and has also recorded solo music.[18][12]\nSerano organizes and hosts GenderEnders, a performance series that features the work of transgender, intersex, and genderqueer artists and allies. It has produced 20 shows. She received a grant to curate \"The Penis Issue: Trans and Intersex Women Speak Their Minds,\" a spoken-word event, as part of the 2007 National Queer Arts Festival.[17]\nShe writes social justice articles on the website Medium. Some topics she frequently writes about include transgender identity, LGBTQ+ visibility, and identity within politics.[19][20]\n\nWorks[edit]\n Serano reads from her book Outspoken in 2017\nBooks[edit]\nEither/Or.

Considered to be a pioneer transgender performer,[1] she was a contributor to the Toronto Sound and is best known for the single Any Other Way, which was a regional Top 10 hit in Toronto in 1962 and a modest national chart hit across Canada in 1967.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n2 Recording career\n3 Post-career attention\n4 Death\n5 Discography\n\n5.1 Singles\n5.2 Albums\n5.3 Compilations\n\n\n6 References\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee,[3] she was born on May 15, 1940. She began performing locally in the 1950s wearing long hair, make-up, and jewellery. Vowing to escape the \"Jim Crow South\",[4] in the late 1950s, she joined a travelling carnival and arrived in Cornwall, Ontario, in 1959, where she said she felt free for the first time.[5]\nIn 1960, Shane moved to Montreal, Quebec,[3] where saxophonist \"King\" Herbert Whitaker invited her along to watch the popular band Frank Motley and his Motley Crew at the Esquire Show Bar. Shane showed up and sat down near the front. When Motley said, \"Get that kid up here and let's see what he can do,\" pianist Curley Bridges invited Shane, then still presenting as a man, onstage for the next set, where she performed songs by Ray Charles and Bobby \"Blue\" Bland.[4]\nShe was soon the band's lead vocalist, and relocated to Toronto with them in late 1961. She returned several times to the United States, on tour with the Motley Crew (to Boston, for example, where they recorded), to New York to record, to visit her family and old friends and perform on a TV show in Nashville, or to live and work in Los Angeles where she played drums in recording sessions.[3][5] A fan mythology linked her to Little Richard, including claims that she had been Richard's backing vocalist before moving to Canada or even that she was Richard's cousin, although no verification of either claim has ever been found and no evidence exists that Shane ever made either claim herself.[6] Music critic Carl Wilson has concluded that, while in reality Shane had deep and identifiable roots in the traditions of the Southern US Chitlin Circuit, the mythology emerged because that scene's traditions were not known to Torontonians in the 1960s, and thus Little Richard was the only antecedent for Shane's performing style that most of her local fan base could identify.[6]\nThroughout her active musical career and for many years thereafter, Shane was written about by nearly all sources as a man who performed in ambiguous clothing that strongly suggested femininity, with some sources even directly labeling her as a drag queen.[7] The few sources that actually sought out her own words on the matter of her own gender identification were more ambiguous, however; she identified herself as male in two early quotes to the Toronto Star, but more often appeared to simply dodge questions about her gender altogether.[8] Her identity as a trans woman was not confirmed on the record by a media outlet until music journalist Elio Iannacci interviewed her for The Globe and Mail in 2017.[9]\n\nRecording career[edit]\nShe released her first single, a cover of Barrett Strong's \"Money (That's What I Want)\", in 1962. \"I've Really Got the Blues\" was the single's B-side. Shortly thereafter, the same label released an alternate version of the single on which \"Money\" was relegated to the B-side, while a different recording of \"I've Really Got the Blues\", with a few revised lyrics and the alternate title \"Have You Ever Had the Blues?\", became the A-side.[10][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nShe followed up with \"Any Other Way\" (b/w \"Sticks and Stones\") later the same year, in the fall of 1962; the song became her biggest chart hit, reaching #2 on Toronto's CHUM Chart in 1963.[8] A cover of a song previously recorded and released by William Bell in summer 1962, Shane's version was noted for adding a different spin to the lyric \"Tell her that I'm happy/tell her that I'm gay\"; while the original lyric intended the word \"gay\" in its older meaning as a synonym of \"happy\", Shane played on the word's double meaning, which was not yet in mainstream usage.[3]\nThe follow-up single to \"Any Other Way\" was \"In My Tenement\" b/w \"Comin' Down.\" It received some airplay in upstate New York, but did not chart elsewhere in the US or Canada, and Shane did not record again for several years.[citation needed]\nIn 1962, Shane was performing at Toronto's Saphire Tavern, specializing in covers of songs by Ray Charles and Bobby Bland.[11] In 1965, she made a television appearance in Nashville on WLAC-TV's Night Train, performing Rufus Thomas' \"Walking the Dog\".[8] Around the same time, she was offered an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, but refused as the booking was made conditional on her presenting as male.[12]\nIn 1967, \"Any Other Way\" was reissued and became a modest hit across Canada, peaking at #68 on the national RPM chart in March.[6] Shane subsequently returned to recording later that year, issuing the single \"Stand Up Straight and Tall\" b/w \"You Are My Sunshine\", and the live album Jackie Shane Live.[10] A final single, \"Cruel Cruel World\" b/w \"New Way of Lovin'\", was released in 1969.[3]\nIn addition to her own recordings, Shane also appeared on Motley's album Honkin' at Midnight, performing live versions of some of the singles she had released under her own name.[13]\nShane faded in prominence after 1970\u201371,[3] with even her own former bandmates losing touch with her; soon after returning to Los Angeles, she turned down an offer to be a part of George Clinton's band Funkadelic.[14] She began caring for her mother, Jessie Shane,[5] who lived in Los Angeles, before relocating to Nashville around 1996 after the death of her mother.[15]\nFor a time she was rumoured to have committed suicide or to have been stabbed to death in the 1990s,[6] but in fact she had retired from music, and moved home to Nashville from Los Angeles. She kept in touch with Frank Motley, who put a Toronto record collector in touch with her in the mid 1990s.  This news was relayed to a small number of her old musician friends, a couple of whom contacted her.  One, Steve Kennedy, discussed with Shane the possibility of organizing and staging a reunion concert, but this never materialized \u2014 the next time Kennedy called the same phone number, it had been reassigned to somebody else who had never heard of Shane.[3]\n\nPost-career attention[edit]\nCBC Radio's Inside the Music aired a documentary feature, \"I Got Mine: The Story of Jackie Shane\", in 2010.[3] At the time, nobody involved in the documentary, the executive producer of which was Steve Kennedy's wife, had been able to determine whether Shane was still alive;[3] but she was subsequently found, still living in Nashville.[13]\nFootage of Shane in performance also appeared in Bruce McDonald's 2011 documentary television series Yonge Street: Toronto Rock & Roll Stories.[16]\nJackie Shane Live was reissued as a bootleg in 2011 on Vintage Music as Live at the Saphire Tavern, although the reissue was inaccurately labelled as being from 1963. Several of the original songs covered in the set list were release much later in the 1960's. [17][10] A compilation bootleg of the studio singles and rarities, Soul Singles Classics, was released the same year.[10] OPM subsequently reissued the album under its original title.\nIn 2015, the Polaris Music Prize committee shortlisted Jackie Shane Live as one of the nominees for the 1960s\u20131970s component of its inaugural Heritage Award to honour classic Canadian albums.[18] It did not win, but has been renominated in subsequent years.\nIn 2017, a group of Toronto writers published the essay anthology Any Other Way: How Toronto Got Queer, a history of LGBT culture in Toronto; in addition to taking its title from Shane's 1962 single, the book includes an essay devoted specifically to Shane.[9]\nIn the summer of 2017, the reissue label Numero Group announced that they would be releasing a double-LP/CD compilation of Shane's music, Any Other Way, on October 20, 2017.[19] The album marked the first time since her final single in 1969 that Shane was directly involved in the production and release of a reissue of her music.[9] The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Historical Album category.[20] In a revealing interview with Elio Iannacci of The Globe and Mail,[21] Shane stated she was planning to return to Toronto to perform live for the first time in nearly five decades.[22]\nIn 2019, Shane granted a broadcast interview to CBC Radio One's Q. The interview was conducted by Elaine Banks, who had been the producer and host of \"I Got Mine\", and was Shane's first broadcast interview since the end of her performing career.[15] In the interview, she confirmed that she returned home to the United States to take care of her ailing mother, but stated that she regretted not having chosen to bring her mother to Toronto instead.[15]\n\nDeath[edit]\nShane died in her sleep, at her home in Nashville, on February 21, 2019.[1][23] Her death was reported to media the following day.[24]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSingles[edit]\n\"Money (That's What I Want)\" b/w \"I've Really Got the Blues\" (1962)\n\"Have You Ever Had the Blues?\" b/w \"Money (That's What I Want)\" (1962)\n\"Any Other Way\" b/w \"Sticks and Stones\" (1962)\n\"In My Tenement\" b/w \"Comin' Down\" (1963)\n\"Stand Up Straight and Tall\" b/w \"You Are My Sunshine\" (1967)\n\"Cruel Cruel World\" b/w \"New Way of Lovin'\" (1969)\nAlbums[edit]\nJackie Shane Live (Caravan Records, 1967)\nHonkin' at Midnight (2000, bootleg, with Frank Motley and his Motley Crew)\nLive at the Saphire Tavern (2011, bootleg)\nSoul Singles Classics (2011, bootleg)\nJackie Shane Live (2015, reissue)\nCompilations[edit]\n\"Slave for You Baby\" and \"Chickadee\" on The Original Blues Sound of Charles Brown & Amos Milburn with Jackie Shane-Bob Marshall & The Crystals (Grand Prix/Pickwick, 1965)\nAny Other Way (Numero Group, 2017)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Jackie Shane, pioneering transgender soul singer, dies at 78\".

The term includes energy used by power systems, generators, logistics assets, and weapons platforms employed by military forces during training and in the field.[3]  Previously Simpson was the Executive Director of the U.S. Army Office of Energy Initiatives (OEI) [4] (previously named the Army Energy Initiatives Task Force[5]) leading the Army's efforts to implement large-scale renewable energy projects.  Her first posting in the Army was as the Special Assistant to the Army Acquisition Executive.  In that role she was a principal advisor to the  United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology[6] on all matters relating to Army acquisition, procurement, research & development and logistics. Upon her appointment to the position of Senior Technical Advisor in the Bureau of Industry and Security in 2010, she became the first openly transgender woman political appointee of any Presidential administration.[7][8][9] Simpson worked in the United States Department of Defense. She is Jewish.[10]\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n2 Flying\n3 Aerospace career\n4 Political career\n5 Non-profit board service\n6 Recognition\n7 References\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nSimpson received her Bachelor of Science in Physics from Harvey Mudd College in 1983,[11] her Master of Science in Engineering from California State University, Northridge in 1988 on a Hughes Aircraft Fellowship, and her MBA from the University of Arizona in 2001 on a Raytheon Fellowship.[11]\n\nFlying[edit]\nSimpson participated in the Bates Aeronautics Program while a student at Harvey Mudd College. She earned her single engine land private pilot's license in 1981, a commercial pilot's license with instrument privileges in 1983, and became a certified flight instructor \u2013 airplane in 1988 and an instrument instructor in 1989. In 1988 she added a multi-engine class rating to her commercial license to qualify for transfer to Hughes Missile Systems as a project test engineer and pilot.  Simpson upgraded to an Airline Transport Pilot's (ATP) license in 1994 after adding multi-engine to her flight instructor ratings in 1991. In 1997 she added single-engine sea (float planes and flying boats) to her ATP license.  In 2005 she became one of only a few licensed pilots flying FAA-certified unmanned aircraft in the national airspace system.\nIn 1989 she co-founded Processional Pilot Training, a fixed based operation at the Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena Airport (KBUR) focused on flight instruction (Private through Airline Transport) taught by professional flight instructors.  She relinquished her ownership share of that business when she relocated to Tucson, Arizona in 1994.\nSimpson was a mission director and project pilot for captive flight test activities beginning in 1988 before taking over as Director of Flight Operations in 1993 for the Integration, Test and Analysis Laboratory at Hughes Missile Systems.  As a systems test pilot she flew the T-39 Sabreliner and Douglas A-3 Skywarrior in support of missile seeker technology development for Hughes Aircraft[12] and Raytheon Missile Systems. In addition she flew numerous large transport category aircraft, light multi-engine and single engine aircraft modified for missile flight test purposes.\nAs of 2009, she has flown over 60 different makes and models of aircraft and has accumulated over 2700 flight hours.\n\nAerospace career[edit]\nWhile an undergraduate, Simpson spent her summers working as a student engineer in the customer service organization on the DC-8/DC-9/DC-10 electrical systems at the Douglas Aircraft facility in Long Beach, and on the AH-64 Apache Target Acquisition and Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Systems at Hughes Helicopter Company in Marina Del Rey.\nSimpson was hired by Hughes Electron Dynamics Division in Torrance, CA in 1983 as an engineer and program manager. She was responsible for engineering and manufacturing of the Gridded Traveling Wave Tube and Continuous Wave Illuminator for the AWG-9/APG-71 radar systems.  In 1988 she transferred to the Hughes Missile Systems Company in Canoga Park, where she became the lead and director of flight operations for the captive flight test activities.  She moved those operations to Tucson, where she consolidated the Hughes activities with the missile test operations of General Dynamics, and later Raytheon, as part of corporate mergers.  Simpson designed and oversaw construction of an 80,000 sq. ft. dedicated flight test facility at the Tucson International Airport.\nSimpson moved into project management in 1999, overseeing the daily operations of small Raytheon, Texas Instruments Defense Systems & Electronics Group, and Standard Missile Company projects that had been relocated to Tucson as part of the corporate merger.\nSimpson occupied several systems engineer, systems architect, and systems integrator roles in between 2002 and 2006 on projects diverse as the Unmanned Combat Armed Rotorcraft (UCAR), the Joint Airborne Weapons System (JAWS; later renamed the Beechcraft AT-6B) and a variety of advanced technology development and demonstration projects at Raytheon.  Simpson also contributed to the development and/or testing of numerous operation missile systems including Maverick, AMRAAM, Standard, Phalanx, TOW, RAM, JAGM, ACM, HARM, JSOW, MALD, ESSM, SilentEyes, Sidewinder, Sparrow, Paveway and Tomahawk.\nShe departed from Raytheon in 2010, at which point she was a Deputy Director and Senior Program Manager, leading teams developing advanced technology in the Advanced Missiles and Unmanned Systems product line.\nCompleting her public service with the Defense Department, she joined Airbus Americas in 2018 as the Vice President for Research and Technology.  In this role she is responsible for establishing the strategic direction and funding opportunities for partnerships with scientific and research communities in North America.\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nSimpson served as a commissioner on the City of Tucson Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Commission from 2001 until 2008, representing Councilwoman Carol West.\nSimpson was a candidate for Representative of District 26 in the Arizona House of Representatives in 2004.  She won the Democratic primary with over 57% of the vote, but was unsuccessful in the general election where she finished third, receiving 20% in the best two of four contest.[13][14]\nIn the 2004 election, Simpson was elected precinct committeeperson, and was chosen as a state committeeperson by the Democratic Party of Legislative District 26 in 2006.  She was also elected to the Executive Board and held the office of District Treasurer in 2008.  She continued to hold those posts until her resignation upon accepting a post in President Obama's Administration in 2009.  In 2005, Simpson was one of the founders of the Democrats of Oro Valley Club.  She was also the first vice chair of the Arizona Democratic Party LGBT caucus.[15]  \nAt the Arizona Democratic State Convention in 2008, Simpson was elected as an Arizona Delegate for Hillary Clinton to the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\nIn late 2009, Simpson accepted an appointment by the Obama Administration,[16] where she served in the Department of Commerce as the Senior Technical Adviser to the Bureau of Industry and Security. \nIn July 2011, Simpson was reposted to the Pentagon as the Special Assistance to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA/ALT).\nIn July 2013, Simpson was detailed to the Army Energy Initiatives Task Force, where she served as the Deputy Executive Director [17] until January 2014, when she was named the Executive Director by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy & Environment (ASA-IEE).[5]  In October 2014, the Army Energy Initiatives Task Force became the U.S. Army Office of Energy Initiatives (OEI).[18]\nIn September 2015, Simpson was sworn in as the first Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy.  This position was the result of the merging of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy, Plans and Programs with the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment to create the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment in late 2014. Simpson served until the end of the Obama administration as she was asked to resign along with nearly all appointees. She departed the Pentagon on January 19, 2017.\n\nNon-profit board service[edit]\nSimpson has served on the boards of the Wingspan Community Center, the Southern Arizona Gender Alliance, the Arizona Human Rights Fund, the National Center for Transgender Equality, Out and Equal Workplace Advocates, and the Southern Arizona Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.[19]\nWhile an employee at Raytheon, she served on the boards of the Raytheon Women's Network; Raytheon Global Women's Network; the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Allies Alliance; and the Raytheon Diversity Council.[20]\nSimpson is an associate fellow with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and served on its Systems Engineering Technical Committee from 2007 to 2009.  She is a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society and serves on the board of directors of the Washington DC branch.\n\nRecognition[edit]\n2018 Harvey Mudd College Outstanding Alumni Award [21]\n2017 DoD Pride Civilian Leadership Award [22]\n2017 Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service\n2016 Arlington Gay Lesbian Alliance (AGLA) Champion Award [23]\n2015 National Conference for College Women Student Leaders Women of Distinction Award[24]\n2015 MTV - \"9 Transgender Trailblazers Who Paved The Way\" [25]\n2014 Time Magazine - \"21 Transgender People Who Influenced American Culture\" [26]\n2013 Julie Johnson Founder's Award by the National Center for Transgender Equality [27]\n2013 Community Advocacy Award by The Capital Area Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce[28]\n2011 LGBT Icon by Equality Forum[29]\n2011 Echo Hall of Fame by Echo Magazine[30]\n2011 Named one of the \"Hidden 105\" by OUT Magazine[31]\n2010 OUTstanding Individual Award (OUT for Work)[32]\n2010 Louise Young Award (Raytheon)[33]\n2006 Raytheon Missile Systems Team Excellence Award[33]\n2005 Grand Marshal, Tucson Pride Parade[34]\n2005 Arizona Human Rights Fund Individual Award[35]\n2004 Tucson YWCA Woman on the Move[36]\n2001 Raytheon Woman on the Move[33]\n1999 DARPA Award for Significant Technical Achievement\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Airbus Americas Appoints Amanda Simpson Vice President, Research and Technology\".

Subsequently, Sinclaire sat as an Independent MEP from January 2010 until September 2012, during which time she set up the We Demand a Referendum party.[4] She was defeated in the 2014 elections, saying in a statement on her website: \"my employers have spoken, and it would seem I have been unsuccessful in my attempt to be re-elected as an MEP for the West Midlands region.\"[5]\nSinclaire was the first ever trans British parliamentarian.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Political career\n\n2.1 UKIP years\n\n2.1.1 Election to European Parliament\n2.1.2 65th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz\n\n\n2.2 Expulsion from UKIP\n2.3 Independent\n\n2.3.1 After UKIP\n2.3.2 Delegation to Tunisia\n2.3.3 Campaign for a referendum\n2.3.4 Taking the petition to Parliament\n2.3.5 Campaigning against Irish fiscal treaty\n2.3.6 Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme\n2.3.7 Football in the community\n2.3.8 Meriden travellers\n2.3.9 HS2\n2.3.10 Aston Arena\n\n\n2.4 We Demand a Referendum Party\n2.5 United States elections of 2012\n2.6 Kashmir\n2.7 Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2013\n\n\n3 Allegations of fraud, misconduct\n4 Electoral history\n5 Personal life\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSinclaire was born in London[1] and educated at the University of Kent at Canterbury, read for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree. She has worked for Lloyds Black Horse Life as a  'problem troubleshooter', was employed as a Gateway store manager, and worked in Cyprus in the hospitality sector.[citation needed] She was a Conservative before joining UKIP.[6]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nUKIP years[edit]\nSinclaire UKIP posts included Head Office Manager (1999\u20132001), member of the National Executive Committee (NEC), and Party Secretary under the leadership of Roger Knapman.\nIn 2001, she was disqualified from the NEC, shortly after being elected.[citation needed] In 2003, representing herself, she took UKIP to the High Court, successfully overturning her disqualification.[citation needed] In 2004, she became Party Secretary, a position which she left to become political assistant and advisor to Mike Nattrass, MEP for the West Midlands (2004\u201309).[citation needed]\nSinclaire stood for the UK Parliament twice as a UKIP candidate: in Medway in 2001 and in Halesowen and Rowley Regis in 2005. At the 2001 general election, she was the party's campaign manager for the three Kent constituencies of Medway, Gillingham, and Chatham & Aylesford.\nDuring the 2005 general election campaign, Sinclaire stood as the UKIP candidate for Halesowen & Rowley Regis, more than doubling the previous UKIP vote. She was arrested after refusing to leave a public debate, \"Queer Question Time\" (to discuss issues related to the gay community)[7] but was released without charge a few hours later.[8]\nIn October 2008, it was reported that Sinclaire briefly met Baroness Thatcher at a Bruges Group dinner.  Sinclaire told Thatcher that she would be standing as an MEP candidate for the UK Independence Party in the West Midlands. According to the BBC report, Thatcher replied \"Good for you. Never give up, never give up\".[9]\nShe has also campaigned abroad, most notably in the United States, assisting on campaigns for US Representative Susan Davis and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.[citation needed]\n\nElection to European Parliament[edit]\nIn the 2009 European elections, Sinclaire was elected as a UKIP Member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands region, while holding the second place on the UKIP list.[10] Thus she became the first openly lesbian member of the European Parliament for the UK delegation.\nOn 11 September 2009, Sinclaire announced she would stand in the 2009 UKIP leadership election.[11] Her decision to stand followed  Nigel Farage's announcement on 4 September that he would stand down as UKIP leader to stand in the general election against John Bercow in Buckinghamshire. The leadership ballot was won by Lord Pearson of Rannoch, with Sinclaire coming third with 1,214 votes.[citation needed]\n\n65th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz[edit]\nSinclaire was invited, as a guest of the European Jewish Congress, to take part in events at Auschwitz, in January 2010, to mark the 65th anniversary of its liberation,[12] and found herself as the only British Member of the European Parliament attending the event.\n\nExpulsion from UKIP[edit]\nIn January 2010, Sinclaire resigned from the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) grouping in the European Parliament, to which UKIP belongs, citing her displeasure at what she claimed to be some of the racist, extremist parties in membership of the EFD Group. She also cited a deterioration in her relationship with Nigel Farage, the joint leader of the EFD group.[13]\nSinclaire was subsequently expelled from UKIP for refusing to be part of the EFD group.[14] On its website, UKIP stated:\n\n\"She has also proved unable to collaborate adequately with the voluntary party in the UK, particularly with the regional committee in the West Midlands. The national executive committee has therefore removed the whip; Nikki Sinclaire may no longer describe herself as a UKIP MEP, and she may not stand as a UKIP candidate in the forthcoming general election.\"[15]\nSinclaire won an Employment Tribunal claim for sex discrimination against her former colleagues. UKIP did not lodge a defence, so the tribunal's decision went against the party by default.[16]\n\nIndependent[edit]\nAfter UKIP[edit]\nSinclaire stood in the 2010 general election in Meriden.  She used the label 'Solihull and Meriden Residents Association', and was endorsed by the Libertarian Party.  Amongst her opponents was a candidate endorsed by UKIP.[17]  She won 1.3% of the vote, compared with 2.6% for the UKIP candidate.[18]\n\nDelegation to Tunisia[edit]\nSinclaire was the only UK politician to be chosen to fly to Tunisia in early February 2011, as part of an international delegation following the ousting of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.[19]\n\nCampaign for a referendum[edit]\nSinclaire launched a campaign for a referendum[20] in July 2010, with the aim of collecting 100,000 signatures calling for a referendum on the UK's continued membership of the European Union.\nThe campaign's first roadshow was held in Stoke-on-Trent on 29 July 2010[21] and visited over 50 towns and cities in the West Midlands alone.\nAlongside her weekly road shows, Campaign for a Referendum created a 'People's Petition'[22] magazine which is in its fourth issue. The magazine gathered cross party support.\n\nTaking the petition to Parliament[edit]\nSinclaire announced that the petition had collected the necessary 100,000 signatures on 9 August 2011. The signatures were officially delivered to Downing Street on 8 September 2011.[23] Sinclaire was joined by MEPs Mike Nattrass and Trevor Colman, along with MPs Kate Hoey, Nigel Dodds and Kelvin Hopkins.\nCampaign for a Referendum went to Manchester for the 2011 Conservative Party conference. Whilst at the conference, she spoke to Prime Minister David Cameron.[24] When asked about the subject, Mr Cameron acknowledged that the petition had been delivered.\nA date for the debate in commons on this issue was set for 27 October,[25] which was then changed to 24 October,[26] allowing for the Prime Minister and William Hague to attend.\nThe motion on a referendum was defeated, but the result caused the largest rebellion against a Conservative Prime Minister over Europe. 79 Conservative MPs voted for the motion, with a further two Conservative abstentions and two acting as tellers for the motion. 19 Labour MPs defied the party whip, alongside one Liberal Democrat.[27]\nDespite the defeat in Parliament, the Birmingham Post reported that she planned to continue the fight of a referendum[28] and on 31 October 2011, Sinclaire launched the second phase of the petition, which called for a referendum on whether to negotiate the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

Sinclaire is also a fanatical Liverpool fan and season ticket holder.\nSinclaire sponsored and distributed a leaflet in August 2012, for Worcester City Football Club[34] to help promote their final season at their St George's Lane ground.\n\nMeriden travellers[edit]\nSinclaire has worked alongside local residents group RAID[35] in protesting against an unauthorised gypsy camp on the Eaves Green Lane site in Meriden, West Midlands.\nThe Travellers on the Eaves Green Lane site were told they would have to leave[36] and were given  a year to move on by Solihull Council in a court hearing in May 2012.[37]\n\nHS2[edit]\nSinclaire is an active campaigner against the HS2 project[38] which aims to link Birmingham and London by High Speed Rail.\nThe Birmingham Post featured her argument with the council about the removal of her anti-HS2 signs.[39]\n\nAston Arena[edit]\nShe has protested to save the Aston Arena, a sport centre based in Aston Birmingham. She delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street with a local charity calling for the Government to save the sports centre.[40]\nSinclaire also led a protest at Birmingham Council house against the demolition of the sports facility.[41]\n\nWe Demand a Referendum Party[edit]\nSinclaire founded the We Demand a Referendum Party in September 2012, with which she planned to contest all British constituencies in the 2014 EU elections. However, the party's only candidates were in her West Midlands European constituency. \nSinclaire spoke at the We Demand a Referendum inaugural conference on 5 October 2012.[42]\n\nUnited States elections of 2012[edit]\nSinclaire campaigned before the United States elections of 2012 in Richmond, Virginia.

Sinclaire spoke in a press conference[45] supporting the right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people has said that she will continue to bring the Kashmiri issue to the political agenda of the European Union (EU).\n\nEdinburgh Festival Fringe 2013[edit]\nSinclaire announced her one-off Edinburgh Fringe Show on 13 August 2013.[46] The show, called \"The EU\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0It's not funny\" is a political satire.[47]\n\nAllegations of fraud, misconduct[edit]\nOn 22 February 2012, Sinclaire was arrested along with three other people; two women aged 55 and 39, as well as a 19-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud the European Parliament following an inquiry into an allegation made in 2010, concerning allowances and expenses.[48][49] Sinclaire denied all the charges, cooperated with the police, and while the investigation was in process would only state that it was tied to a disgruntled employee who was themselves the subject of a similar investigation.[48] On 23 July 2014, she was charged with money laundering, contrary to Sections 327 or 329 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and misconduct in public office, contrary to Common Law, relating to European Parliament travel expenses, in a period between October 2009 and July 2010.[50]\nIn the Court case subsequent to Sinclaire's office manager John Ison having been cautioned by the judge that he was incriminating himself and when it was shown in open court that John Ison was colluding with Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, on 11 July 2016, the jury in Sinclaire's trial found her not guilty on all counts.\nSinclaire criticised the West Midlands Police investigation as a 'Vanity Case' as it cost \u00a31.5\u00a0million to pursue the case regarding a sum of \u00a33,200 that Sinclaire was alleged to have fraudulently claimed.[51]\n\nElectoral history[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nConstituency\n\nParty\n\nVotes\n\n%\n\n\u00b1%\n\n\n2001\n\nMedway\n\nUKIP\n\n958\n\n2.5\n\n+1.6\n\n\n2005\n\nHalesowen and Rowley Regis\n\nUKIP\n\n1,974\n\n4.8\n\n+2.4\n\n\n2009 (European)\n\nWest Midlands\n\nUKIP\n\n300,471\n\n21.3\n\n+3.8\n\n\n2010\n\nMeriden\n\nSolihull and Meriden Residents' Association\n\n658\n\n1.3\n\nN/A\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSinclaire was assigned male at birth, but felt she was \"trapped in the wrong body\" from the age of three.

She is also one of San Francisco's most famous transgender women and was a Grand Marshal in the 2008 San Francisco Pride Parade.[1]\nSparks is also a member of the Emeritus Board of the Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club, a Navy veteran and a trained engineer.[2][3][4] She is a member of the board of directors of the Horizons Foundation, a community-based LGBT philanthropic organization.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Transitioning\n3 Activism\n\n3.1 Public Service\n3.2 Police Commission\n\n\n4 Good Vibrations\n5 Woman of the Year\n6 Awards and honors\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nTheresa Sparks was born on April 8, 1949, in Kansas City, Kansas, where she grew up.[3][5][6][7][4][8] Assigned male at birth, Sparks expressed her gender identity at an early age by wearing women's clothing, though she later resisted these impulses in adolescence.[3]\nSparks went to Kansas State University and graduated with a degree in engineering.[4] She served in the United States Navy.  Later she managed several waste management and recycling companies and patented two recycling techniques.[7]\nShe married her first wife in 1971 and together they had three children: two sons and a daughter. After nine years of marriage, Sparks finally revealed to her wife her desire to live as a woman. They separated shortly after and eventually divorced. Sparks remarried, but that marriage also ended in divorce.[3]\nSparks underwent \"intense therapy and an electric shock treatment\" to try to suppress her femininity, before deciding at last to embrace her gender identity. \"It's an unusual condition, but it's not unnatural,\" she said later. \"You discover that the only way to live with it is to transition physically so your physical appearance matches how you feel about yourself.\"[7]\n\nTransitioning[edit]\nBy 1997, Sparks moved to San Francisco, where she felt she could more easily adjust to life as a woman.[3][4]\nBut even there, in a city known as one of the most transgender-friendly in the country, Sparks faced challenges as a transgender woman.[9] Despite 20 years of experience in waste management and managing three environmental consulting companies as a man, Sparks struggled to find an occupation in San Francisco as a woman. She applied unsuccessfully for more than 100 jobs.[3][10] Sparks eventually acquired sporadic work as a cab driver, bank teller, and census taker to avoid becoming homeless.[3][7]\nOne evening while walking through the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco, an area known to be strolled by transgender sex workers, Sparks said she was harassed by a police officer, who demanded to see her identification and questioned what she was doing there. \"[The police] assume if there's a transgender person walking down the street in the Tenderloin it's probably because they're prostitutes,\" she later said about the experience.[11]\n\nActivism[edit]\nNot long after her arrival in San Francisco, Sparks immersed herself in the San Francisco political landscape. Frustrated with the obstacles she and other transgender people were facing such as employment and housing discrimination, anti-transgender violence, police harassment, and a lack of affordable medical treatment, she helped organize a group of transgender activists to lobby the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. In 1999 they formed the Transgender Political Caucus (TPC)[12] and campaigned to elect members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who would fight for transgender civil rights.[13]\nSparks became the chair of the nascent transgender activist group, TG Rage, and in 1999 organized the very first Transgender Day of Remembrance to memorialize those transgender men and women who lost their lives to transphobic violence.[14] Held in the Harvey Milk Plaza of the Castro District, the Transgender Day of Remembrance grew into an annual event honored around the world every November.[15][16][17]\n\n Sparks speaks at the San Francisco Trans March, June 2016.\nPublic Service[edit]\nIn 2000, Sparks' activism prompted Supervisor Mark Leno to create a new city work group, the Transgender Civil Rights Implementation Task Force, of which Sparks became a charter member.[18] A year later, Sparks and Leno helped to establish broader medical benefits for municipal employees diagnosed with Gender dysphoria.[7][19] The new law was the only governmental policy of its kind in the nation and provided medical coverage for hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery.[19]\nMayor Willie Brown appointed Sparks to chair the LGBT Advisory Committee of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission in early 2001, making her the Commission's first-ever transgender appointee.[4] Sparks used her position to lobby for a new transgender-sensitivity training program for county police officers, which the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) on August 10, 2001 agreed to produce. The program includes specific guidelines for how to treat transgender people and how to appropriately document cases involving transgender people.[11] She served on the commission for two four-year terms.[20]\nOn June 16, 2016, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee appointed Sparks as senior advisor on transgender initiatives.[21]\n\nPolice Commission[edit]\nImpressed with Sparks' public service, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors appointed Sparks a police commissioner, and she was sworn in on April 30, 2004 by Mayor Gavin Newsom.[22] She served for two years as the commission vice president until May 24, 2006, when she voluntarily declined to reapply for that position: the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sparks \"slam[med]\" her fellow commissioners, citing the Police Commission's lack of progress in addressing the city's high murder rate, loss of SFPD staff, and low police morale.[23]\nOn May 9, 2007, Sparks made history yet again when she was elected president of the San Francisco Police Commission by a single vote, making her the first transgender person ever to be elected president of any San Francisco commission and San Francisco's highest ranking transgender official.[6][24][25] The deciding vote was cast by Commissioner Joe Alioto Veronese, which came as a surprise to many observers who expected the Newsom-appointee to back Joe Marshall, the candidate Newsom preferred. Newsom himself was reportedly stunned.[26]\n\"Theresa defines trailblazer,\" Cecilia Chung told the San Francisco Bay Times shortly after the election. Chung, deputy director of the Transgender Law Center and a member of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, saw Sparks election as a landmark moment for transgender people in the city. \"Her brilliance and dedication continue to open doors for transgender people throughout San Francisco and the state. She represents a strong, committed voice for our community on issues of police reform and oversight; and this election is a clear indicator of the increasing number of leadership opportunities that are open to more and more community members.\"[25]\n\nGood Vibrations[edit]\nSparks found some temporary work in 2001 in the shipping department of the worker-owned sex toy company Good Vibrations. The general manager of Good Vibrations, Beth Doyle, quickly recognized Sparks' management skills and hired her as a financial manager when the position became available three months later.[27]\nDoyle left the company in April 2005, frustrated with the constraints of the co-op business structure, and the board of Good Vibrations elected Sparks to be the new general manager. On February 1, 2006 under Sparks' leadership, the board voted unanimously to drop Good Vibration's co-op structure but retain its progressive business roots. Sparks herself was the main instigator of the change. \"We researched Whole Foods, Ben & Jerry's, and others. All these companies have progressive values, but they're not co-ops,\" Sparks' explained to a reporter later. \"Something had to give.\" Shares of the newly structured company were split evenly.[27]\nHowever, Good Vibrations' Internet sales, which had initially been successful and at one time accounted for two thirds of its income, began to suffer as mass-market retailers Amazon.com and Drugstore.com began to carry adult merchandise. The company also faced competition from small independent adult entertainment websites.[28] Facing a cash crisis, the company appealed on its website for potential investors to enable it to buy inventory for the 2007 holiday season. In September, 2007, the company was purchased by adult novelty wholesaler GVA-TWN, which also owns 50 adult retail stores in the Midwest and affiliate program PECash.[28]\nBefore the sale, the board of directors included Sparks, Margaret Cho, Donna Daniels, Charlie Glickman, Carol Queen, Linda Shaw and James Williamson. Both companies announced that there were no immediate plans to lay off workers or change the company's management.[28]\nAt a speech commemorating the Compton's Cafeteria riot, Sparks said her company was \"one of the top U.S. employers of transgenders\" and \"proud to continue the fight for transgender equality.\"[29]\n\nWoman of the Year[edit]\nIn 2003, Theresa Sparks became the first transgender woman ever named \"Woman of the Year\" by the California State Assembly.[30] Assemblyman Mark Leno, Sparks' friend and a fellow activist for transgender civil rights, said he selected Sparks for the award, not only to honor her advocacy on behalf of the LGBT community, but to humanize a transgender civil rights bill he introduced earlier that year.[31] Assembly Bill 196, which was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis later that year, amended the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, making it illegal to discriminate in employment or housing decisions on the basis of transgender status or gender stereotypes.[32][33]\nJay Leno angered the National Transgender Advocacy Coalition (NTAC) after making jokes about Sparks' award on a March 31, 2003 broadcast of his talk show, The Tonight Show. During his opening monologue, Leno quipped, \"The California Assembly awarded a man who had a sex change as its Woman of the Year. When he accepted the award, he said there was a part of him that didn't want to accept it \u2014 but that's gone now.\"\nThe NTAC's executive director, Vanessa Edwards Foster, criticized Leno's comments as dehumanizing. \"In a country where no positive accomplishments of transgender people are ever reported it's curious that belittling humor of these same people is openly welcomed,\" Forster said. \"Leno's remarks took an historic recognition for a transgender community leader and summarily diminished it with insensitive humor.\" The NTAC also criticized Leno for using the male pronoun to refer to Sparks.\nThe LGBT Advisory Committee of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission reported at a meeting on April 15 that Jay Leno had apologized to Mark Leno for his comments. Minutes of the meeting also recorded that \"national organizations have been responding to Mr. Leno without conferring with Commissioner Sparks first\".[34]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nHonor Roll of LGBT Elected and Appointed Officials, Horizons Foundation (2004)\nCommunity Service Award, Alice B.

Their musical style has varied from country to electronic-influenced indie rock and folk punk.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n2 Career\n3 Discography\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSpoon grew up as a transgender person in Calgary, Alberta. They were raised in a Pentecostal household to a paranoid-schizophrenic father. Their father's religious beliefs caused anxiety to a teenage Rae. Spoon now lives in Victoria, British Columbia.\nIn 2003, Spoon said they identified as a trans man.[2] In 2012, during an interview with fellow advocate for the gender-neutral pronoun and cartoonist, Elisha Lim, Spoon noted a preference for the pronoun \"they\",[3] and has identified as non-binary since then.[4] They explained to Now Magazine, \"after years of fighting to be called 'he,' the idea of coming out again made me tired. But now I feel kind of rejuvenated, ready to fight on some more. I think the 'they' pronoun is a pretty cool thing. It's letting a lot of people not have to identify as a man or a woman. Whatever it means to them.\"[5]\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which forced them to cancel a series of tours, Spoon was diagnosed with cervical cancer. They said they didn't know what the prognosis was at that point.[6]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nHow do you become a transgender country singer? For some, it's easier to be transgender from the start,and then work towards becoming a singer. For others it is better to play music first, and then come out as transgender. About ten years ago, I managed to do both in the space of a few months.\nRae Spoon[7]\n\n\nSpoon started performing before they started recording. They decided they wanted to become a songwriter while performing at the age of seventeen.[8] They emerged as a country and roots singer. Their early music features country imagery to the sound of acoustic string instruments such as banjo, guitar and mandolin.[9]\nSpoon has performed with such artists as Annabelle Chvostek, Ember Swift, Kinnie Starr, Melissa Ferrick, The Be Good Tanyas, Bitch & Animal, Natalie Merchant and Earl Scruggs.[10] They have performed at festivals including North Country Fair, South Country Fair, Under the Volcano Festival, and the Vancouver,[10] Regina, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton, Brandon Folk, Music & Art Festival and Winnipeg folk festivals.\nSpoon's breakthrough album, 2008's Superioryouareinferior, was recorded in Calgary and introduced some electronic music elements into Spoon's style.[1] Superioryouareinferior includes themes previously used by Spoon like Canadian history and culture such as the commentary on colonialism in their song \"Come On Forest Fire Burn The Disco Down\".[11] Superioryouareinferior was a longlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize.[12]\nWhile touring Europe Spoon met Alexandre Decoupigny in Berlin. Decoupigny and Spoon collaborated in the album Worauf Wartest Du?[13] Decoupigny taught Spoon how to create music with a computer which inspired the musician to further experiment with electronic music.[14] The experimentation with electronic music influenced their subsequent albums and culminated in I Can't Keep All Our Secrets.[15]\nThey have also published First Spring Grass Fire, a book of short stories about growing up in Alberta. Arsenal Pulp Press released the book in the fall of 2012.[5] The book was a nominee for the 2013 Lambda Literary Awards in the Transgender Fiction category,[16] and Spoon was awarded an Honour of Distinction from the Dayne Ogilvie Prize for LGBT writers in 2014.[17]\nSpoon has stated that First Spring Grass Fire was written to help them  prepare for the production of a National Film Board of Canada documentary about their life and music, My Prairie Home, directed by Chelsea McMullan. The film was released in the fall of 2013.[18][19] My Prairie Home, the album of music that Spoon composed for the film, was a longlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.[20]\nIn 2012, Spoon and Ivan Coyote collaborated on Gender Failure, a touring multimedia show in which both artists performed music and spoken word pieces about their failed attempts at fitting into the gender binary.[21] A book based on the show was published by Arsenal Pulp in 2014.[22] Gender Trouble was nominated for the ALA's Over the Rainbow Project List in 2015.[23]\nIn 2014, Spoon composed music for the feature film The Valley Below.[24]\nSpoon began the music label Coax Records \"out of a love for indie music and as an answer to under representation for many groups in the music industry.\"[25] The album \"Armour\" was released on Coax in 2016.[26]\nIn 2017, Spoon published a manual in the How To series, entitled How to (Hide) Be(hind) You Songs.[27]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nHonking at Minivans (2001)\nThrow Some Dirt on Me (2003)\nYour Trailer Door (2005)\nWhite Hearse Comes Rolling (2006)\nTrucker's Memorial (2006, with Rodney Decroo)\nsuperioryouareinferior (2008)\nWorauf wartest du?

After serving as City Manager in Greenfield, California for four years, she served as Chief Operating Officer of Administrative Services of the Santa Clara Valley Water District in San Jose, California until her resignation on November 30, 2017.  On September 11, 2020, she was ordained to the Priesthood in the Episcopal Church by Bishop Lucinda Ashby in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.\nShe grew up in the Catskill Mountains  in New York.[2] Stanton was married to Donna Becker[3] and they have a teenaged son named Travis. Stanton became the subject of national and international media attention in February 2007 after disclosing that she is transgender and would be pursuing sex reassignment, leading Largo city commissioners to initiate the process of ending her contract as city manager,[2] a decision which Stanton appealed.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Berea, Kentucky\n2.2 Largo, Florida\n2.3 Continuing Her Career\n2.4 Lake Worth, Florida\n2.5 Greenfield, California\n\n\n3 Largo human rights debate\n4 Transgender issues\n\n4.1 Struggle with being transgender\n4.2 Decision to pursue sex reassignment\n4.3 Preparing to go public\n4.4 \"Outed\"\n4.5 Public reaction\n4.6 Personal impacts on Stanton and family\n\n\n5 Job loss\n\n5.1 Largo City Commission vote to end Stanton's employment\n5.2 Attempt to retain position\n5.3 National media interest\n5.4 Reaction from national LGBT community\n5.5 Support in the local community\n5.6 Fired\n5.7 Announces intent not to sue\n\n\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nSusan Ashley (born Steven Bruce) Stanton grew up in the Catskill Mountains of New York. Her public school years were relatively uneventful. She later recalled being rejected as a drummer in the sixth grade band and, in ninth grade, being told by a coach that at 5 feet 9 she was too short to play on the basketball team.  In high school she worked cleaning offices at night for 30 hours a week, and she was a typist for the yearbook, her only extracurricular activity.[5] Stanton earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in public administration from the University of Florida in Gainesville.[5][6]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly in her career, Stanton held positions at various times as assistant to the city manager of Newburgh, New York; administrative assistant to the borough manager of Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska; and assistant to the city manager of Champaign, Illinois.[5]\n\nBerea, Kentucky[edit]\nAs city administrator in Berea, Kentucky, a position she held for about four years,[6] Stanton took part in negotiations which brought four manufacturing companies to Berea, representing a total capital investment in the city of $120 million and annual payrolls of $10 million.[5] The industries included Tokico Ltd., which planned to build a $20 million shock absorber and brake assembly plant that would employ 150 people, and Alcan Aluminum, which built a $50 million aluminum recycling plant.[7][8]  The Alcan plant became the largest used aluminum can recycling facility in the world.[9] Stanton received an  honorary award from Kentucky governor Wallace Wilkinson, who named Stanton a Kentucky Colonel.[5]\n\nLargo, Florida[edit]\nStanton was hired away from Berea to become assistant city manager in Largo, Florida in August 1990. Stanton worked under city manager Stephen Bonczek until April 20, 1993 when Bonczek resigned under pressure from city commissioners, who were unhappy with Bonczek's poor relationship with city workers and unions. At that point Stanton became interim city manager, and was formally hired as acting city manager in May 1993 (with a consequent rise in salary). City commissioners cited their confidence in Stanton, as well as the time and cost of recruiting a replacement for Bonczek, as their reason for hiring in-house. City Clerk Henry Schubert was reassigned at the same time to the post of assistant city manager. Both assignments were open-ended, with the commission delaying its decision on a permanent city manager until later that year.[6] Stanton's posting was made permanent in September 1993, with an 18-month contract and another increase in salary.[10]\nIn total, Stanton had a career spanning 17 years with the City of Largo and as of 2007[update], had spent 14 years as city manager[2] where she reportedly received good reviews for her performance.[11] In September 2006, she was given an $11,000 annual pay raise, bringing her annual salary to over $140,000. She managed a $130-million budget and about 1,200 employees.[11]\nStanton was on paid administrative leave while the City of Largo began the legal process of terminating her contract,[11] pursuant to her confirmation on February 21, 2007 to the St. Petersburg Times that she was transgender and was in the process of pursuing sex reassignment.[2]\n\nContinuing Her Career[edit]\nAfter her termination from the City of Largo, Stanton had her name legally changed to Susan Ashley Stanton.[12] Stanton decided to continue her long professional career in public policy and politics while undergoing gender transition. Stanton appeared in public for the first time as a woman on May 9, 2007.[13] Stanton lobbied Congress on behalf of laws to protect gay and transgender people from employment discrimination.[14] Stanton testified before Congress, appeared on TV with Larry King and Montel Williams and became the somewhat reluctant face of the transgender-equality movement. Susan applied for more than 100 positions in city management, but had interviewed in less than half a dozen cities.[15] Atlanta's Gay Pride Parade asked Stanton to be grand marshal. A Chicago transgender convention invited her to speak. The City of Sarasota named Stanton a finalist for its city manager job.[13] Stanton was eventually named third for the position as city manager in Sarasota, FL, but didn't get the job.[16]\n\nLake Worth, Florida[edit]\nTwo years after losing her job as Largo city manager, Susan Stanton was picked to lead Lake Worth, Florida.[17][18] Stanton was selected as City Manager of Lake Worth, Florida, on April 7, 2009 by a 4-1 vote. Lake Worth City Commissioner Suzanne Mulvehill said she liked Stanton's approach to marketing the city and her ability to work for such a long time in Largo. Commissioner Cara Jennings said she favored Stanton because of her team-building approach to managing city staff. Vice Mayor Jo-Ann Golden stated, \"I thought she had the right temperament for our city and, truthfully, I learned a lot from her.\"[19][20] Mac Craig, City of Largo's current manager, stated, \"I think she'll make an excellent city manager. I personally think they're lucky to have her.\"[14] Stanton was selected for the job from a group of 50 candidates.[21] Lake Worth, a city of about 37,000 people, near the ocean in Palm Beach County offered Stanton an annual salary of $150,000. Stanton was quoted as saying, \"Lake Worth has a very progressive city commission and a staff that wants to improve the quality of life in the community. It's the first place I wanted to work after I left graduate school at the University of Florida.\"[17]\nShe was terminated abruptly from her position at Lake Worth on December 6, 2011.[22]  In reflecting upon Stanton's dismissal, the Palm Beach Post noted that during her tenure \"she dismissed low-performing employees and brought in smart, eager wonks. She revised union contracts that were stacked against the city. She prodded cities that owed Lake Worth for contracted services. She saved Lake Worth $2 million a year on its police and fire contracts.[23]\n\nGreenfield, California[edit]\nIn October 2012, the Greenfield City Council appointed Stanton City Manager.[24]  As Greenfield's City Manager, Stanton had oversight responsibilities for sanitary sewer and water utility systems, police, streets, drainage, parks, recreation, planning, zoning, building, community development and finance. In 2016, Greenfield became one of the most progressive communities in Monterey County to regulate dispensing, cultivation and the manufacture of medical marijuana.[25]\n\nLargo human rights debate[edit]\nIn 2003, a contentious debate took place in Largo over a proposed human rights ordinance that would prohibit discrimination in the municipality based on race, religion, gender, disability, gender identity, or sexual orientation. More than 100 people packed a five-hour public hearing on the proposed ordinance at Largo's City Hall on August 5, 2003, hearing testimony from over 40 people on both sides of the question.  Had the ordinance passed, it would have made Largo the 64th municipality in the United States to extend equal rights protection to transgender people through the inclusion of gender identity. However, the proposed ordinance failed by a 4 to 3 vote of the City Commission, leaving both gender identity and sexual orientation as permissible reasons for Largo residents to be discriminated against in employment, housing, and public accommodations.[26][27]\nCity workers did, however, receive protection three months later on October 7, 2003, when the City Commission unanimously approved the Discrimination and Harassment Prohibition policy, an internal antidiscrimination policy, that applied to all city employees. In contrast with the city-wide August debate, not even one individual opposing the internal policy attended the commission meeting.[28]\nThe city employee policy prohibited discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, religion, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. The policy applied to city employees and prohibited discriminatory conduct both in the workplace and in any work-related setting, such as during business trips.  The policy included definitions of harassment and retaliation, and explained that sexual harassment could involve individuals of the same or different gender. Extensive training for all city employees was set to take place in November and December 2003, under Stanton's direction in her role as city manager.  The policy was passed partly in reaction to two incidents in which a fire department lieutenant and a police officer made racial slurs.[28][29][30]\n\nTransgender issues[edit]\nStruggle with being transgender[edit]\nStanton reports having had thoughts of transitioning since she was a child, and recalls wearing her sister's clogs when she was age 6 or 7 to walk to the candy store. In adolescence, she tried on her mother's tennis dress, and while in college she went to the library to read about cross-dressing. After graduation, she threw away all her \"girl clothes\" after deciding that cross-dressing was incompatible with a career in municipal government. She continued to collect women's items, but purged them with each new job.[31]\nIn 1990, Stanton married her wife Donna, and thought she had closed the \"cross-dressing\" chapter of her life.[31] She and her wife had a son, Travis, in 1993, shortly after she became acting city manager of Largo.[10] However, in 1997 she became involved in an Internet chat group for cross-dressers.[31]\n\nDecision to pursue sex reassignment[edit]\nStanton supported the proposed city-wide ordinance, though she did not take a prominent role in the debate that surrounded it.  Afterwards, she began to discuss her feelings with a therapist who had testified in support of the ordinance, and ultimately made the decision along with her wife to pursue sex reassignment. Since then, Stanton underwent counseling, with clinical psychologist and gender therapist Kathleen Farrell, and hormone replacement therapy in preparation for sex reassignment surgery at some future date.\n\nPreparing to go public[edit]\nStanton met privately with Largo City Mayor Pat Gerard on January 1, 2007 to inform her that she was transgender and intended to begin the final stages of gender transition in the coming year.[32][33] Stanton shared her plans only with a very small group of confidential advisers, including her wife, a  medical team and a few top officials at City Hall.[32][33][34] Stanton and Gerard worked together to write an eight-page plan to help make her decision public in June, a time chosen because Stanton's 13-year-old son could be out of town and be shielded from the attendant publicity.[32][34][35][36]\n\n\"Outed\"[edit]\nAn unidentified source leaked Stanton's intentions to the St. Petersburg Times, and on February 20, 2007 a reporter went to Stanton's office for a regular weekly meeting and informed her that the paper had received a tip.[37] Stanton had little choice but to sit for an interview even though she had not yet discussed the situation with her son.[37]  An interview was scheduled for the following morning to give Stanton time to talk with her family. Stanton was accompanied by Largo Mayor Pat Gerard during the interview.[31]  Stanton informed her son that she was transgender that night.[37]\nOn February 21, 2007, the St. Petersburg Times published a news article[31] on the Internet regarding Stanton's intentions.  A press conference was held at City Hall the same day. Stanton and Mayor Pat Gerard explained the plans and events they had developed to make Stanton's transgender identity public in June. Stanton disclosed that she would begin wearing dresses to work on April 2 and would be known from that day forward as Susan Stanton.[36]\nAlso on February 21, 2007, Stanton sent an email to city employees explaining the situation. \"Like many transgendered people,\" Stanton wrote, \"I have privately struggled with this very personal matter all of my life and have kept it secret from my family, friends and co-workers. I hoped I could outrun it when I got married, became a father and found a job I love. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\"  She stated her intention to continue in her job as Largo city manager throughout her transition. In addition to her email, Stanton provided two pages of \"historical information about myself and my plans for the future.\"[32][33]\nLargo Police Chief Lester Aradi sent out another email that same day to employees of the Largo Police Department, expressing support for Stanton and reminding police officers that inappropriate comments, jokes or other communications in the work environment were not appropriate or allowed.[38]\n\nPublic reaction[edit]\nFollowing the breaking of Stanton's story, e-mails and faxes to the city from Largo residents were mostly negative, while non-Largo residents sent mostly positive notes. Anonymous blog postings were generally negative or expressed confusion.[39] Initially there was little interest from national media.[40] One concern commonly expressed by both city residents and city employees was whether Stanton's sex reassignment surgery would be paid for by taxpayers; in fact, Stanton's counseling and hormonal treatments were paid for by Stanton herself, as will be her eventual surgery.[39][40]\n\nPersonal impacts on Stanton and family[edit]\nStanton had hoped to remain married, but was uncertain what would happen.  She said that her wife had been dealing with an upsetting situation as best as she can.[37]  On Larry King Live on April 13, 2007, Stanton announced that she and her wife were separating. In August, 2008, Stanton announced that her marriage had come to an end. Susan Stanton agreed to pay alimony and child support to her ex-wife.[41] Stanton was assaulted while out running, though Stanton was uncertain if it was related to the controversy. She suffered a few small scratches on her nose.[3]\n\nJob loss[edit]\nLargo City Commission vote to end Stanton's employment[edit]\nBy the end of the week following Stanton's public outing on February 21, 2007, Commissioner Mary Gray Black, apparently the only commissioner Stanton had not personally informed of her plans, called for a special meeting of the city commission to discuss Stanton's contract and future employment. To terminate Stanton's employment according to the Largo city charter, five of the seven city commissioners would have to vote in the affirmative.  According to Stanton's contract, upon her dismissal a severance package would include 12 months' salary unless she were convicted of a felony, had violated the state code of ethics, or had committed \"gross misconduct.\"[42]\nA special meeting of the city commission was held on February 27, 2007. It lasted four hours and was attended by 444 members of the public.[43] Approximately 60 individuals, mostly Largo residents, testified. In a five to two vote, the commission voted to place Stanton on administrative leave until her termination could be made final. Mayor Pat Gerard and Commissioner Rodney Woods were the two commissioners who voted to retain Stanton. Commissioners then named assistant city manager Norton \"Mac\" Craig as acting city manager.[34]\n\nAttempt to retain position[edit]\nThe vote taken by the Largo City Commission on February 27, 2007 began the three-step process necessary to remove Stanton as the city manager. Stanton was placed on paid administrative leave while the city began the legal process required to end her contract, which stipulates that she can be fired at any time without cause with a 5-2 vote. The commission must vote a second time to formally remove Stanton from her position.[11]\nThe National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) was assisting Stanton in an attempt to persuade the City Commission to reverse its decision to terminate her employment.[44] NCLR had stated they would represent Stanton in legal proceedings, if necessary, in an effort to help her regain her position.[45] Stanton appealed the City Commission's decision to fire her on March 8, 2007, and planned to seek a public hearing within 30 days at which she intended to make a presentation of up to three hours on transgender individuals and the workplace transition process for transgender people.[4][46]\n\nNational media interest[edit]\nOn February 28, 2007, the day following the special commission meeting, Stanton, reportedly surprised by the abrupt loss of her job, began fielding calls and taking part in interviews with local television stations. She was also interviewed by Michele Norris of National Public Radio.[35][47]\nStanton told the St. Petersburg Times that she didn't want to waste the opportunity such media interest provided to help \"the next person that comes out with the same disclosure so he doesn't suffer the same consequences.\" By that afternoon, Stanton had received approximately 45 media calls.[35]\nOn April 17, 2007, The Daily Show with correspondent Rob Riggle featured a segment of Stanton's firing.  In March 2010, Stanton was the subject of a two-hour CNN documentary, \"Her Name was Steven\", about her transition from man to woman.[48]\n\nReaction from national LGBT community[edit]\nTransgender activists immediately protested the decision to fire Stanton.[49] One LGBT rights group, the National Sexuality Resource Center, started a 'Stand with Stanton' petition to pressure the City Commission of Largo, Florida to reverse their decision.[50]\nThe Human Rights Campaign reported that if the vote to fire Stanton was upheld, the Largo city commissioners would be \"in direct violation of the city government's own internal non-discrimination policy... that explicitly prohibits discrimination in public employment on the basis of gender identity and expression,\"[51] referring to the city's Discrimination and Harassment Prohibition policy, adopted in October 2003.[30] The National Center for Lesbian Rights similarly denounced the commission's decision to fire Stanton, also citing the city's internal non-discrimination policy.[52]\n\nSupport in the local community[edit]\nOn 3 March 2007, the St. Petersburg Times published the results of a survey conducted on its behalf by Communications Center Inc. of Lakeland, Florida. The survey found that a majority of adults in the city of Largo and in Pinellas County, where Largo is located, believed the commission had been wrong to move to fire Stanton as city manager.  The survey also found widespread acceptance among city and county residents for transgender persons in the workplace, whether in the public or private sector.[53]\nAn interfaith coalition of local religious leaders organized a protest at Largo City Hall to urge the City Commission to reconsider its decision to fire Stanton. The religious leaders involved in the protest wished to counteract the religion-based claims of other religious leaders that supported Stanton's termination as city manager.[54] A total of 350 people, including clerics and congregation members from more than a dozen local churches and synagogues, attended the 30-minute protest on March 6.[55]\n\nFired[edit]\nOn March 23 during a six-hour meeting of Largo city council, the motion was made to terminate Stanton's employment. Commissioner Black tabled a motion to terminate the city manager's contract of employment. After a brief deliberation, this was upheld by five of the commissioners while Mayor Pat Gerard and Commissioner Rodney Woods dissented. Thus, at five minutes past midnight, Stanton's employment officially ended.[56]\nThe five commissioners who voted to uphold the decision to fire Stanton contended that her employment was terminated due to a loss of confidence in her and had nothing to do with her impending transition; \"You have to believe us, you have to trust us, it is not about transgenderism,\" Commissioner Gay Gentry was reported to have said.[57] It is important to note, however, that the city commissioners did not even consider firing her before her plans to become a woman had been announced.\n\nAnnounces intent not to sue[edit]\nOn April 13, 2007, Stanton appeared on the Larry King Live show on CNN accompanied by her attorney, Karen Doering, of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. She announced on the program that she \"absolutely\" would not sue the city, comparing a potential suit against the city as \"like suing my mother.\"\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Office of City Manager\".

Steele made numerous film and television appearances, including hosting a transgender beauty pageant featured in the film Trantasia.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and career\n2 Outing and its effects\n3 Transsexual beauty contest hostess\n4 Controversy\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and career[edit]\nBorn in San Antonio, Texas, Steele was a Miss Gay USA pageant winner in the Texas finals under the name Jhoana Reis.[4] In her early twenties, Steele under went gender confirmation surgery, also known as sexual reassignment surgery.[5] She then left San Antonio and moved to Las Vegas, Nevada following her sex reassignment surgery. She later changed her name legally to Jahonau Erica Steele. She joined the cast of the Crazy Girls Revue at the Riviera in Las Vegas during the late 1980s. In 1991, Steele was voted \"the sexiest showgirl on The Strip\".[6]\n\nOuting and its effects[edit]\nMost people in Las Vegas, including the producer who hired her and her costars, \"knew she was transgender but didn't care.\"[7] She was outed on a 1992 edition of the television program A Current Affair. Following her outing by A Current Affair people began questioning Jahna's womanhood and asking if she was a girl, to which she'd reply, \"Well last time I looked, for the past 25 years.\"[6] The story of her outing and its negative effect on her showgirl career was featured in The National Enquirer.[8]\nAfter being fired from Crazy Girls Revue, Steele was a frequent talk show guest and sang in nightclubs across the United States before moving to Hawaii. She also appeared as a guest star in a second-season episode of NYPD Blue (\"Don We Now Our Gay Apparel\"), playing the character Candace La Rue.[9] Steele was additionally on the Maury Povich Show in the early 90s. Following her outing as being a transgender woman, she received much publicity leading her to be on various talk shows such as the Maury Show. When asked about her experience on the show, Steele stated, \"...[the show] it was much more based on education and kindness. Now it's about exploitation and freakism, and like, 'We fooled you. Hardy-har-har. This is a man.' Which is just so insulting to somebody who's lived such a distressful life, because it's not easy growing up with a gender-identity disorder.\"[6]\nSteele later returned to school, and \"learned how to do things other than entertaining\" so that she'd have something to fall back on, studying computer courses and working for United Blood Services before she worked for a women's health facility and got certified in nonprofit management.[6] Prior to her death, she also began hosting Aleman's La Cage drag show at the Riv, and it was the last job she had before overdosing in January 2008.[6]\n\nTranssexual beauty contest hostess[edit]\nSteele made her comeback in 2004 when she hosted The World's Most Beautiful Transsexual Contest at the Riviera.[10] A documentary feature film based on the pageant, Trantasia, recognized Steele's pioneering place in the history of the transsexual community.  Steele was also featured on several segments of Entertainment Tonight in connection with Trantasia.  Following the success of the film, Steele continued her singing career and was the spokesperson for Tingari Skin Care System. Steele was working on her \"kiss-and-tell\" autobiography, Always a Lady[11]  when she died in Las Vegas.[12] The cause of death was accidental overdose of cocaine, morphine and hydromorphone.[13]\n\nControversy[edit]\nThere is some controversy over Steele's career, particularly regarding the Riviera. Jahna was hired by show producer Norbert Aleman, and she quickly became the star of Crazy Girls Revue. Aleman, as well as Steele's co-show girl performers knew that she was transgender, however when Steele's trans identity was outed, Aleman fired her because Crazy Girls was an \"\u00fcber-straight topless revue\"[5] and that did not include transwomen. Several years later due to the public attention towards the transgender community, Aleman brought Steele back to host The World's Most Beautiful Transexual at the Riviera. The show went on to be documented and star Steele in Trantasia filmed by Jeremy Stanford.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Clarke, Norm (January 26, 2008). Jahna Steele R.I.P.

At the age of 10, Stone was the youngest person to receive hormone blockers in Australia, which set a precedent that eventually changed the law that compelled transgender children and their families to apply to the Family Court of Australia to access stage one treatment. She continues to advocate for transgender children, and is one of the most visible transgender individuals in Australia.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Activism\n2.2 Acting\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 Filmography\n\n4.1 Television\n\n\n5 Awards and nominations\n6 See also\n7 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nGeorgie Stone was born on 20 May 2000 in Melbourne, Australia to parents Greg Stone and Rebekah Robertson. She initially attended Valkstone Primary School but moved to Bentleigh West Primary School in 2009. In her high school years, Stone studied at Elwood College. Stone began studying a Bachelor of Arts at The University of Melbourne in 2019.

In February 2016, Stone and a number of other families of transgender kids travelled to Canberra to speak with politicians about changing the law.[4] Stone and her mother were interviewed on The Project[5][6] in response to the controversy surrounding the Safe Schools Coalition and the importance of the program. Later that year, Stone and her family appeared on Australian Story,[7] telling their story. Stone started a petition on change.org in August 2016, rallying support for law reform [8] which has so far gained over 15,000 signatures.[9][10][11] Stone has also spoken out in support of transgender kids being allowed to use the bathroom of their choice,[12] the importance of the Safe Schools Coalition,[13] and the Pride Centre located in St Kilda.[14]\nStone was announced as a judge at the 2017 GLOBE Community Awards.[15] Stone also featured in the ABC Me television series, \"Advice to My 12-Year-Old-Self\", which aired on 11 October in celebration of the United Nation's International Day of the Girl.[16][17] The show consists of 37 interviews, all lasting 2 minutes in length, of prominent Australian women. In late 2017, Stone was made the official ambassador for the Royal Children's Hospital Gender Service in Melbourne.

He was perhaps the first transgender man to publicly identify as gay,[1] and is largely responsible for the modern understanding of sexual orientation and gender identity as distinct, unrelated concepts.[2]\nSullivan was a pioneer of the grassroots female-to-male (FTM) movement and was instrumental in helping individuals obtain peer-support, counselling, endocrinological services and reconstructive surgery outside of gender dysphoria clinics. He founded FTM International, one of the first organizations specifically for FTM individuals, and his activism and community work was a significant contributor to the rapid growth of the FTM community during the late 1980s.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Transition and adulthood\n3 Activism and community contributions\n\n3.1 Editor of The Gateway\n3.2 GLBT Historical Society\n3.3 Lobbying for recognition of gay trans men\n\n\n4 Honors\n5 Works\n6 References\n7 External links\n8 Further reading\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSullivan grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Sullivan was born the third child of six in a very religious Catholic family and attended Catholic primary and secondary school.[3] Sullivan started keeping a journal at the age of 10, describing his early childhood thoughts of being a boy, confusing adolescence, sexual fantasies of being a gay man, and his involvement in the Milwaukee music scene.[3][4] During his adolescence he expressed continued confusion about his identity, writing at age 15 in 1966 that \"I want to look like what I am but don't know what some one like me looks like. I mean, when people look at me I want them to think\u2014 there's one of those people [\u2026] that has their own interpretation of happiness. That's what I am.\"[5]\nSullivan was attracted to the idea of playing different gender roles,  and his attraction for male roles was outlined in his writings, specifically in his short stories, poems and diaries; he often explored the ideas of male homosexuality and gender identity.[3] At the age of seventeen he began a relationship with a self-described \"feminine\" male lover, and together they would play with gender roles and gender-bending.[3]\n\nTransition and adulthood[edit]\nIn 1973, Sullivan identified himself as a \"female transvestite\" and by 1975 he identified himself as a \"female-to-male transsexual\".[3] In 1975, it \"became apparent\" that Sullivan needed to leave Milwaukee for somewhere where he could find \"more understanding\" and access hormones for his transition, so he decided to move to San Francisco.[6] His family was supportive of the move and gave him \"a handsome man's suit and [his] grandfather's pocket watch\" as going-away presents.[6]\nUpon arrival in San Francisco, Sullivan began working at the Wilson Sporting Good Company, where he was employed as a woman but cross dressed as a man much of the time.[3] In his personal life, Sullivan lived as an out gay man, but he was repeatedly denied sex reassignment surgery (SRS) because of his sexual orientation and the expectation of the time that transgender people should adopt stereotypical heterosexual opposite-sex gender roles.[1] This rejection led Sullivan to start a campaign to remove homosexuality from the list of contraindications for SRS.[1][3]\nIn 1976, Sullivan suffered a severe crisis of gender identity and continued living as a feminine heterosexual woman for the next three years.  In 1978 he was shaken by the death of his youngest brother.[4] In 1979, Sullivan was finally able to find doctors and therapists who would accept his sexuality and began taking testosterone, with double mastectomy surgery following a year later.[1][3] He then left his previous job to work as an engineering technician at the Atlantic-Ritchfield Company so that he could fully embrace his new identity as a man with new co-workers.[3]\nIn 1986, Sullivan obtained genital reconstruction surgery. He was diagnosed as HIV positive shortly after his surgery, and told he only had 10 months to live.[7] It is likely that Sullivan was HIV- infected in 1980, just after his chest surgery.[4] He wrote, \"I took a certain pleasure in informing the gender clinic that even though their program told me I could not live as a Gay man, it looks like I'm going to die like one.\"[1] Sullivan died of AIDS-related complications on March 2, 1991.\n\nActivism and community contributions[edit]\nSullivan wrote the first guidebook for FTM persons,[8] and also a biography of the San Francisco FTM, Jack Bee Garland.[9] Sullivan was instrumental in demonstrating the existence of trans men who were themselves attracted to men.[10][11][12][13] Lou Sullivan began peer counselling through the Janus Information Facility which was an organization that provided transgender issues.[14] He is also credited for being the first to discuss the eroticism of men's clothing.[14]\n\nEditor of The Gateway[edit]\nSullivan was active in the Golden Gate Girls/Guys organization (later called the Gateway Gender Alliance), one of the first social/educational organizations for transgender people that offered support to FTM transsexuals, and in fact successfully petitioned to add \"Guys\" to its name.[3] From July 1979 to October 1980, Sullivan edited The Gateway, a newsletter with \"news and information on transvestism and transsexualism\"[15] that was circulated by the Golden Gate Girls/Guys.[16] It was originally primarily focused on the needs of MTF and transvestite readers and read \"much like a small town newspaper\", but under Sullivan's editing it gained more gender parity between MTF and FTM issues. According to Megan Rohrer, Sullivan \"transform[ed] Gateway in a way that [would] forever change FTM mentoring\" because trans people could still obtain information on how to pass without having to attend group gatherings in person.[16]\n\nGLBT Historical Society[edit]\nSullivan was a founding member and board member of the GLBT Historical Society (formerly the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society) in San Francisco. His personal and activist papers are preserved in the institution's archives as collection no. 1991\u201307; the papers are fully processed and available for use by researchers, and a finding aid is posted on the Online Archive of California.[17] The Historical Society has displayed selected materials from Sullivan's papers in a number of exhibitions, notably \"Man-i-fest: FTM Mentoring in San Francisco from 1976 to 2009,\"[18] which was open through much of 2010 in the second gallery at the society's headquarters at 657 Mission St. in San Francisco, and \"Our Vast Queer Past: Celebrating San Francsico's GLBT History,\" the debut exhibition in the main gallery at the society's GLBT History Museum that opened in January 2011 in San Francisco's Castro District.[19]\n\nLobbying for recognition of gay trans men[edit]\nLou was a writer and capable of standing up for what he saw as truth. He was a gay transsexual man, before this was even allowed or recognized. He is also the person who helped to change that, and now \u2013 being gay is no longer an issue if you want to begin transition.\u2014\u2009Max Wolf Valerio[20]\nSullivan lobbied the American Psychiatric Association and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health for them to recognize his existence as a gay trans man.[14] He was determined to change people's attitudes towards trans homosexuals[21] but also to change the medical process of transition by removing sexual orientation from the criteria of gender identity disorder so that trans men who are gay could also access hormones and surgery, essentially making the process \"orientation blind\".[21]\n\nHonors[edit]\nIn June 2019, Sullivan was one of the inaugural fifty American \u201cpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\u201d inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn.[22][23] The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history,[24] and the wall\u2019s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.[25]\nIn August 2019, Sullivan was one of the honorees inducted in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco\u2019s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields.\"[26][27][28]\n\nWorks[edit]\n\"A Transvestite Answers a Feminist\" in Gay People's Union News (1973)\n\"Looking Towards Transvestite Liberation\" in Gay People's Union News (1974)\nFemale to Male Cross Dresser and Transsexual (1980)\nInformation for the Female to Male Cross Dresser and Transsexual (1990)\nFrom Female To Male: The Life of Jack Bee Garland (1990)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e Highleyman, Liz. \"Who was Lou Sullivan?\".

Eastern Airlines became the federal legal precedent for transsexual legal status under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[2]\n\nLife and career[edit]\nUlane was born in Chicago, Illinois and graduated from St. Ignatius College Prep. Ulane joined the United States Army and flew combat missions in the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1968, then became a pilot for Eastern Airlines.[2] Following employment with Eastern Airlines, Ulane transitioned from Kenneth to Karen Frances in April 1980.[3]\nT.R. Buttion, the Senior Vice President of Flight Operations presented her with a letter of termination on April 24, 1981 that read, \"It is our belief that the controversial nature of the operation you have undergone will detract from and prevent any flight crew of which you are a part of from operating in the integrated, coordinated fashion that is necessary to attain the highest degree of safety.\" The letter also noted that other Eastern pilots would refuse to fly with her.[4]\nUlane  filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which resulted in the civil case, Ulane v. Eastern Airlines. In her case against Eastern Airlines, Ulane reported coping with gender dysphoria from the age of 5 or 6.[3] Although she won the case against Eastern,[5] it was overturned on appeal the in U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.[2][6][7]\nUlane died in the crash of a chartered DC-3 she was piloting on a training flight, approximately five miles southwest of DeKalb, Illinois on May 22, 1989.

This piece, where she also had the opportunity to sing, ran for eight years in Santiago. During this time, she participated in more pieces, most notably in Migrante (Migrant), a piece about migration.[15][16] Vega's profile was elevated to a wider audience when she appeared in the music video of the famous song \"Maria\" by Manuel Garc\u00eda in 2014. The song and music video were made in collaboration with a gay suicide prevention organization, to help raise awareness and prevent suicide in gay teens.[17] She made her screen debut in 2014 in a drama called The Guest (La Visita), playing a trans woman at her father's wake.[18][14]\n\n Vega at the red carpet of the F\u00e9nix Awards 2017, Mexico\nThe 67th Berlin International Film Festival saw the release of A Fantastic Woman (2017), directed by Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio, a film for which her performance was acclaimed by critics.[19][3] A Fantastic Woman tells the story of Marina (played by Vega) and Orlando (played by Francisco Reyes), an older man with whom she is in love and planning a future. After Orlando falls ill and dies, Marina is forced to face family and society, and fight again to show who she is: a fantastic woman.[20] Critic Guy Lodge in a review for Variety praising Vega's performance said: \"Vega's tough, expressive, and subtly distressed performance deserves far more than political praise.\" He continued to note that \"It\u2019s a multi-layered, emotionally polymorphous feat of acting, nurtured with pitch-perfect sensitivity by her director, who maintains complete candor on Marina\u2019s condition without pushing her anywhere she wouldn\u2019t herself go.\"[21] Her name was strongly mentioned for an Oscar nomination as Best Actress.[22][23][24] She won an award for her performance at the Palm Springs International Film Festival for Best Actress in a Foreign Language Film.[25] A Fantastic Woman went on to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Vega became the first openly transgender person ever to be a presenter at the Academy Awards ceremony in 2018.[26][27][28]\nIn 2018, it was announced that Vega would have a recurring role in the Netflix miniseries Tales of the City.[29]\n\nMedia image[edit]\nVega became the first transgender person in history to be an Academy Awards presenter in 2018.[30] Time magazine named Vega one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018.[5]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\nRef(s)\n\n\n2014\n\nThe Guest (La Visita)\n\nElena\n\n\n\n[14]\n\n\n2017\n\nA Fantastic Woman\n\nMarina Vidal\n\nOriginal title Una mujer fant\u00e1stica\n\n[31]\n\n\n2019\n\nThe night, unsheltered\n\nGabriela\n\nShort film\n\n\n\n\n2020 \n\nUn Domingo de Julio en Santiago\n\nPamela\n\nCompleted\n\n\n\n\nTBA \n\nFutura\n\nTBA\n\nPost-production\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\n\nDenotes films that have not yet been released\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\nRef(s)\n\n\n2019\n\nTales of the City\n\nYsela\n\n3 episodes\n\n[32]\n\n\nTBA \n\nThe Pack\n\nTBA\n\n\n\n[33]\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\n\nDenotes television shows that have not yet been released\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nNominated work\n\nCategory\n\nResult\n\nRef(s)\n\n\n2015\n\n17\u00e8mes Rencontres du Cin\u00e9ma sud-am\u00e9ricain\n\nThe Guest (La Visita)\n\nBest Actress\n\nWon\n\n[34]\n\n\n2017\n\nFilm Festival Lima PUCP\n\nA Fantastic Woman\n\nBest Actress\n\nWon\n\n[35]\n\n\nPremio iberoamericano de cine F\u00e9nix\n\nBest Actress\n\nWon\n\n[36]\n\n\nHavana Film Festival\n\nBest Actress\n\nWon\n\n[37]\n\n\n2018\n\nPalm Springs Film Festival\n\nBest Actress in a Foreign Language Film\n\nWon\n\n[38]\n\n\nDorian Awards\n\nBest Performance of the Year \u2013 Actress\n\nNominated\n\n[39]\n\n\nHerself\n\nRising Star Award\n\nNominated\n\n\nInternational Cinephile Society Awards\n\nA Fantastic Woman\n\nBest Actress\n\nNominated\n\n[40]\n\n\nCaleuche Awards\n\nBest Leading Actress\n\nWon\n\n[41]\n\n\nPlatino Awards\n\nBest Actress\n\nWon\n\n[42]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Mackelden, Amy (March 2, 2018). \"Everything You Need to Know About A Fantastic Woman Star Daniela Vega\".

She is a trans woman, and has been active in many fields like television and radio.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Personal life\n3 Career\n\n3.1 Television\n3.2 Radio\n3.3 Politics\n3.4 Film\n3.5 Activism\n\n\n4 Controversies\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nRose became aware of her gender identity when she was around five years old[2] and felt uncomfortable with being forced to behave as a boy. She started dressing as a woman when she was in her early twenties.\nShe finished her high school in the year 1996 from Sri Ramakrishna Mission Higher Secondary School (South), Chennai. She studied mechanical engineering at Sathyabama Engineering College (currently Sathyabama University), Chennai between 1997 and 2001. She travelled to the United States to study Biomedical Engineering at Louisiana Tech University between 2001 and worked as a website designer before returning home to Chennai in 2003.[3][4]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIt took Rose years to tell her family how she felt, but when she did, they were devastated. When she decided to transition in 2004,[5] her family used violent means to prevent her and even looked at marriage as a possible solution. She was hit by her brother and was locked up in a room. She even attempted to commit suicide. She was thrown out of her house and she worked for a while in a call centre. She currently lives with her family who only conditionally accept her. Her mother has broken off all ties and has moved out of their house.[6][7][8]\nIn 2010, she made the decision to get sexual reassignment surgery done in Thailand, something that received significant media attention.[9][10]\n\nCareer[edit]\nTelevision[edit]\nRose made her television debut in the talk show Ippadikku Rose (English: Yours truly, Rose) which aired on Vijay TV. The show dealt with current affairs touching a wide variety of social issues including traditions, taboos, rebels and culture and had an audience of tens of millions. The show began in February 2008 and ended in April 2009, with Rose shifting to Kalaignar TV for the show Idhu Rose Neram (English: This is Rose Time) in July 2009.[11] In the show, she played a US-born Tamil character who studies Indology and invites people to her home for discussions on issues such as obesity.\n\nRadio[edit]\nHaving ended her television career in 2010, she became a Radio Jockey at BIG FM 92.7 in June 2011, airing the afternoon show Rosudan Pesungal (English: Talk with Rose) on Weekdays.[12]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nIn March 2012, she stated that she planned to form a political party, the Sexual Liberation Party of India. She said that the party's goals would be promoting sexual freedom and the rights of women and LGBT people.[13] Some of the initial proposals would be to legalize prostitution and brothels, change adultery laws and lower the minimum age for sex to 14\u201315 years.[14]\n\nFilm[edit]\nShe will be making her directorial debut with Cricket Scandal, which also features her in the lead with Kishan as the male lead.[15] --> She is also making plans for films featuring transgendered characters and is looking for a production partner for her reality television series about gender reassignment surgery.[16]\n\nActivism[edit]\nRose has been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ rights, women's rights and free sexual expression. Over the years, she has built her career around openly raising societal issues through the medium of radio and politics as well. Currently involved in organic farming on the outskirts of Chennai and working as a freelance in the corporate sector, Rose trains employees to get their American accent right and teaches them English grammar and speech.[17]\nAccording to her, there is more maturity in the corporate world but it is not without its problems pertaining to discrimination based not only on sexuality but also gender.[18]\n\nControversies[edit]\nAt a press meet that she had organized, the audience from the press was totally packed however, none of the newspapers had covered it. In instance of discrimination against transgender people, a journalist from a reputed English newspaper had once approached her for contacts of sex workers for personal use.[19]\nAlthough afraid of the backlash, Rose said that she will continue to be in media until she exposes their hypocrisy.[20]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"India's transgender talk show host\". 5 March 2008.

She was bullied at school and by kids in the neighborhood. As a teenager, she came out as gay, and eventually found acceptance from her peers and parents.[8]\nWillis attended college at the University of Georgia, where she encountered more harassment for being gender non-conforming.[2] She came to realize that she was a trans woman, and decided to transition.[8]  She worked with other students to counter discrimination based on gender identity.[2] Willis graduated in 2013 with a bachelor's degree in journalism.[4][9]\n\nActivism and career[edit]\nAfter graduating from college, Willis moved to Atlanta and began getting involved in activism with fellow transgender and gender non-conforming people of color.[2] She later came to live in Oakland and work as a communications associate, then national organizer, for the Transgender Law Center.[2][3]\nWillis was one of the speakers at the 2017 Women's March in Washington, D.C.[10][11] She later stated that though she was glad to be there, she felt that trans women were an \"afterthought in the initial planning\", and she was cut off by organizers when she tried to say this at the demonstration itself.[12][13]\nWillis has spoken out strongly on behalf of trans women, criticizing comments by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie that differentiated transgender women from cisgender women,[14] and calling for a boycott of The Breakfast Club radio show after comedian Lil Duval joked about killing trans women during an interview.[15]\nWillis designed the Black Trans Flag, a variation on the Transgender Pride Flag with a black instead of white stripe across the middle.[16]\nWillis' writings have appeared in publications including The Huffington Post,[17] BuzzFeed,[18] and Autostraddle.[19] She also hosted The BGD Podcast with Raquel Willis.[3][20]\nIn December 2018, Willis was appointed as executive editor of Out magazine, becoming the first trans woman to take on a leadership position at that publication.[5]\nWillis, along with Neal Broverman, endorsed Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[21]\nIn June 2020, Willis was announced as the new Director of Communications for the Ms. Foundation for Women.[6]\n\nWork[edit]\nThis section of a biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.

She subsequently joined Acorn Computers and was instrumental in designing the BBC Micro, including the BBC BASIC programming language whose development she led for the next 15 years. She first began designing the ARM reduced instruction set computer (RISC) in 1983, which entered production two years later. It became popular in embedded systems and is now the most widely used processor architecture in smartphones. Wilson is currently a director at the technology conglomerate Broadcom Inc.[5][6] In 2011, she was listed in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article titled \"The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History\".[7] She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 2019.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Honours and awards\n4 Personal life\n5 See also\n6 References\n\n6.1 Sources\n\n\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn Roger Wilson, she was raised in Leeds, Yorkshire, by parents who were both teachers, her father specialising in English and her mother in physics.[2] From 1975,[8] she studied computer science and the Mathematical Tripos at Selwyn College, University of Cambridge.[3] In an Easter break from university, Wilson designed a microcomputer with a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor inspired by the earlier MK14,[9] which was used to electronically control feed for cows.[6]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 1978, she joined Acorn Computers Ltd, after designing a device to prevent cigarette lighter sparks triggering payouts on fruit machines.[6] Her computer design was used by Chris Curry and Hermann Hauser to build the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first of a long line of computers sold by the company.[10][9]\nIn July 1981, Wilson extended the Acorn Atom's BASIC programming language dialect into an improved version for the Acorn Proton, a microcomputer that enabled Acorn to win the contract with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their ambitious computer education project.[11] Hauser employed a deception, telling both Wilson and colleague Steve Furber that the other had agreed a prototype could be built within a week. Taking up the challenge, she designed the system including the circuit board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new DRAM integrated circuits to be sourced directly from Hitachi. By Thursday evening, a prototype had been built, but the software had bugs, requiring her to stay up all night and into Friday debugging. Wilson recalled watching the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer on a small portable television while attempting to debug and re-solder the prototype. It was a success with the BBC, who awarded Acorn the contract. Along with Furber, Wilson was present backstage at the machine's first airing on television, in case any software fixes were required. She later described the event as \"a unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to program.\"[12]\nThe Proton became the BBC Micro and its BASIC evolved into BBC BASIC, whose development was led by Wilson for the next 15 years. As well as programming, she wrote the manuals and technical specifications, realising communication was an important part of being successful.[6]\nIn October 1983, Wilson began designing the instruction set for one of the first reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processors, the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM),[13] The ARM1 was delivered on 26 April 1985 and worked first time.[14] This processor type was later to become one of the most successful IP cores \u2013 a licensed CPU core\u00a0\u2013 and by 2012 was being used in 95% of smartphones.[6]\nWilson designed Acorn Replay, the video architecture for Acorn machines. This included operating system extensions for video access, as well as the codecs, optimized to run high frame rate video on ARM CPUs from the ARM 2 onwards.\nShe was a member of the board of the technology and games company Eidos Interactive, which bought and created Eidos Interactive, for the years following its flotation in 1990. She was a consultant to ARM Ltd when it was split off from Acorn in 1990.\n\n Wilson giving a public presentation on ARM development in 2009\nSince the demise of Acorn Computers, Wilson has made a small number of public appearances to talk about work done there.[15]\nShe is now the Director of IC Design in Broadcom's Cambridge, UK office.[5] She was the Chief Architect of Broadcom's Firepath processor.[16] Firepath has its history in Acorn Computers, which, after being renamed to Element 14, was bought by Broadcom in 2000.\nWilson was listed in 2011 in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article titled \"The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History\".[7]\n\nHonours and awards[edit]\nShe was awarded the Fellow Award by the Computer History Museum in California in 2012 \"for her work, with Steve Furber, on the BBC Micro computer and the ARM processor architecture.\"[1][17] In 2013 Wilson was elected as a Fellow of the prestigious Royal Society.[18] She received the 2014 Lovie Lifetime Achievement Award in acknowledgement for her invention of the ARM processor.[19] In 2016 she became an honorary fellow of her alma mater, Selwyn College, Cambridge.[8]\nWilson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to computing.[20]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nWilson underwent gender reassignment from male to female in 1994.[21][22] She enjoys photography and is involved in a local theatre group, where she is in charge of costumes and set pieces and has acted in a number of productions. She has also played a cameo role as a pub landlady in the BBC television drama Micro Men, in which a younger Wilson is played by Stefan Butler.[22]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of pioneers in computer science\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Sophie Wilson: 2012 Fellow\".

After changing her name she began to falsely tell people she was the heiress to Woodlawn Cemetery.\nIn 1962, at the age of fifteen, Woodlawn left Florida heading north. She recollected that \"I hocked some jewelry and ... made it all the way to Georgia, where the money ran out and ... had to hitchhike the rest of the way\" to New York City.[5]\nShe recalled in her memoir, A Low Life in High Heels:\n\nAt the age of 16, when most kids were cramming for trigonometry exams, I was turning tricks, living off the streets and wondering when my next meal was coming.\nBy 1969, she had considered sex reassignment surgery, but decided against it.[5]\n\nMovie career[edit]\nWoodlawn met Andy Warhol at the Factory, at a screening of Flesh (1968). Through him she met Jackie Curtis, who cast Woodlawn in her play Heaven Grand in Amber Orbit in the autumn of 1969.\nIn October, she originally was given a bit role in Trash, but so impressed director and screenwriter Paul Morrissey that he re-wrote it to give her a much larger role. In Trash, Joe Dallesandro plays a heroin addict on a quest to score who, ambivalent about his sexuality, has a transgender girlfriend played by Woodlawn. The pair contrasted the other with violent episodes of over-dose matched by improvisation and sulky rejection. Woodlawn ad libbed many of the lines herself, preferring creativity to strict adherence to the script. Woodlawn was paid $25 per day during filming, spending the last day's on heroin. In October 1970, she received word from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that George Cukor, supported by others, was petitioning the Academy to nominate her for Best Actress for her work in Trash, but nothing came of this. In Morrissey's next film she was joined by others in Warhol's pantheon of stars, to play in Women in Revolt, a satirical look at the women's rights movement and the PIGS (politically involved girls). In this film, she became one of the first people to say the word cunt in cinema.[6]\nIn May 1971, Woodlawn replaced Candy Darling at the La MaMa theatre in a production of Vain Victory written and directed by Jackie Curtis. She was arrested and briefly incarcerated in Puerto Rico after being caught shoplifting. Woodlawn created a stir when she was arrested in New York City after impersonating the wife of the French Ambassador to the United Nations. When arrested, she was taken to the Women's House of Detention then transferred to a men's facility when the fact that she was transgender was discovered.\nIn 1972, director Robert Kaplan and cinematographer Paul Glickman concocted the idea of a movie whose premise would be using a transgender woman as the lead in a film without revealing the sex of the actress. Woodlawn played a young, starstruck girl hoping for success as an actress in New York City. The film, Scarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers, was a low budget, 16\u00a0mm, unsuccessful musical feature. The song \"In The Very Last Row\", written by Marshall Barer, was performed by Bette Midler.\nIn 1977, Woodlawn moved to San Francisco. She returned to New York later in the year, appearing on Geraldo Rivera's talk show, before being jailed again in 1978 for violating terms of probation. She was released on the appeal of politician Ethan Geto, who helped organize a benefit for her. By 1979, she had surrendered to a faltering career, cut her hair and moved back to her parents' home in Miami, while working as a busser at Benihana.\nBack in New York in the mid-1980s, she became a featured singer in Gabriel Rotello's Downtown Dukes and Divas revues at clubs such as The Limelight and The Palladium, and a star of various musicals and revues mounted by the songwriting and producing team of Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman. In 1991 she published her autobiography, the Holly Woodlawn Story, \"A Low Life in High Heels\" with writer Jeff Copeland.\nDuring the 1990s, Woodlawn achieved a modest film and theatrical comeback, making cameo appearances in productions such as Night Owl (1993) and Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1998). After Warhol's death, she was interviewed frequently on his life and influence. At the time of her death she resided in West Hollywood where in the late 90s she participated in riot grrrl shows with Revolution Rising, and recorded spoken words for songs with experimental recordings by the band Lucid Nation. In 1999 she was in a controversial film about conjoined twins who live in a run down motel in a small town. Twin Falls Idaho was followed four years later by Milwaukee, Minnesota. More recently she acted in Transparent, a U.S. television series about a transgender mother played by Jeffrey Tambor.\n\nAppearance[edit]\nWhen Holly Woodlawn appeared in public she would dress as a dazzling alternative image of Jean Harlow, complete with wig and frosted lipstick. She presented as a glamorous actress, saying:\n\nI was very happy when I gradually became a Warhol superstar. I felt like Elizabeth Taylor. Little did I realize that not only would there be no money, but that your star would flicker for two seconds and that was it \u2013 the drugs, the parties, it was fabulous.\n\nIn the opinion of Vincent Canby, \"Holly Woodlawn, especially, is something to behold, a comic book Mother Courage who fancies herself as Marlene Dietrich but sounds more often like Phil Silvers.\"[7]\n\nCabaret artiste[edit]\nWoodlawn's first cabaret engagement was a solo act in 1973 at Reno Sweeney in New York.[8] The following year, she performed with Jackie Curtis in \"Cabaret in the Sky\" at the New York Cultural Center.  In the early 2000s, she resumed performing cabaret in sold-out shows in New York and Los Angeles. She continued to travel with her cabaret show, most recently appearing in Manhattan's Laurie Beechman Theater in 2013.[9]\n\nDeath[edit]\nWoodlawn fell seriously ill in June 2015, and was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. Tests later revealed that she had lesions on her liver and brain.[10] The lesions were later determined to be cancer. Woodlawn's health improved enough for her to be sent home, where she continued treatment and received in-home healthcare. She was later forced to vacate her West Hollywood, California, apartment due to flooding, and entered an assisted living facility in October.[11]\nWoodlawn died of brain and liver cancer in Los Angeles on December 6, 2015.[12]\nWoodlawn was included during the In-Memoriam segment at the 88th Academy Awards.[13]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nWoodlawn's estate founded the Holly Woodlawn Memorial Fund for Transgender Youth at the Los Angeles LGBT Center.[14]\nLou Reed refers to Woodlawn in his song \"Walk on the Wild Side\", the opening verse of which describes her hitchhiking journey and gender transition:[15]\n\n\nHolly came from Miami, F-L-A\nHitchhiked her way across the USA\nPlucked her eyebrows on the way\nShaved her legs and then he was a she\nShe says, \"Hey, babe, take a walk on the wild side.\"\n\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nYear\n\nFilm\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1970\n\nTrash\n\nHolly\n\na.k.a. \"Andy Warhol's Trash\"\n\n\n1971\n\nWomen In Revolt\n\nHolly\n\n\n\n\nIs There Sex After Death?\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n1972\n\nScarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers\n\nEve Harrington / Rhett Butler\n\n\n\n\n1973\n\nBroken Goddess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1979\n\nTally Brown, New York\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n1993\n\nNight Owl\n\nBarfly\n\n\n\n\nMadonna: Deeper and Deeper Music Video\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n1995\n\nThe Matinee Idol\n\nParty Guest\n\n\n\n\nScathed\n\nMiss Antonia Curtis\n\n\n\n\n1996\n\nPhantom Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1998\n\nBilly's Hollywood Screen Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeverly Hills Hustlers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1999\n\nTwin Falls Idaho\n\nFlamboyant at Party\n\n\n\n\n1999\n\nCitizens of Perpetual Indulgence\n\nUncreditted\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\nThe Cockettes\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2003\n\nMilwaukee, Minnesota\n\nTransvestite\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\nSuperstar in a Housedress\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2006\n\nJack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\nAndy Warhol: A Documentary Film\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2007\n\nAlibi\n\nGracie\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\nHeaven Wants Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nBeautiful Darling\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\nThe Lie\n\nCherry\n\nPost-production\n\n\n2011\n\nThe Ghosts of Los Angeles\n\nHolly\n\nShort\n\n\n2012\n\nShe Gone Rogue\n\nAunt Holly\n\nShort\n\n\n2013\n\nContinental\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\nI Am Divine\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\nEast of the Tar Pits\n\nMattie\n\na.k.a. \"Gary LeGault's East of the Tar Pits\"\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1971\n\nAn American Family\n\nHerself\n\n1 episode\n\n\n2015\n\nTransparent\n\nHerself\n\n2 episodes\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/movies/holly-woodlawn-transgender-star-of-1970s-underground-films-dies-at-69.html\n\n^ Piepenburg, Erik (July 28, 2011). \"When They Play Women, It's Not Just an Act\".

After graduating, she worked in freelance art and web design.[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2006, Wright gained an interest in glitches and exploits used to complete games at faster times than their designers had intended. She started reading discussions about speedrunning games, at the Speed Demos Archive's forums. She soon began to speedrun games herself and spent hours practicing games, most notably The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Wright practiced both of the games for hours while streaming on her Twitch account, building up a large audience. In July 2014, Wright achieved the world record for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, completing the game in 18 minutes and 10 seconds. This run is one of the most famous speedruns of Ocarina of Time, partly due to Wright's video providing commentary and explanation on the methods used in the run which gained over a million views on Youtube.[13] The record stood for half a year when it was beaten by three seconds by Joel W. \"Jodenstone\" Ekman.[14] As Wright's popularity started to grow, she began to stream more games such as Paper Mario and Castlevania 64.[2]\nIn 2009, she and Daniel \"Jiano\" Hart together created the website SpeedRunsLive. The two aimed to create a \"richly developed speedrunning racing platform\" through an Internet Relay Chat community run by a Racebot. The website soon grew to host many speedrunners who live streamed through Twitch. Wright and many other members of SpeedRunsLive have attended various charitable events in the past hosted by Speed Demos Archive, most notably Awesome Games Done Quick. She has supported almost all of these events by running games during marathons.\nWright is also an accomplished Super Smash Bros. Melee player, having played Melee at EVO 2013 and 2014.[15]\nIn 2015, Wright was invited by Nintendo to attend the Nintendo World Championships along with fifteen other players.[16] She managed to reach the final round of the competition, where she competed with John Numbers to get as far as possible in a series of four Super Mario Maker levels. She placed second in the Championships after facing difficulty with a section of the final level, and received a New Nintendo 3DS XL signed by Shigeru Miyamoto for her efforts.[17]\nSince 2015, her Twitch channel began to move away from a majority of speedrun content, with newer streams consisting mostly of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Mario Maker.\nWright came out as a transgender woman in November 2015 and began to transition, changing her name to Narcissa.[18] On April 7, 2016, she temporarily deleted her Twitch account, citing abuse and online criticism,[19] though it was reactivated on April 10.[20] Her Twitch account was suspended indefinitely in 2018 due to violations of the site's policies regarding nudity and sexual content.[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Cosmo reads his Wikipedia page YouTube.

As well as the Giro second-place finish, York finished second in two other Grand Tours: the 1985 and 1986 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.[2] The second place at the 1985 Vuelta came after losing the leader's jersey on the penultimate stage, in what is widely thought to have been collusion by the Spanish-speaking teams.[3] Further victories came at the 1985 Volta a Catalunya, the 1989 Tour of Britain and the 1990 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nAfter retiring in 1995, York moved into journalism, as well as spending a year as a coach for British Cycling.[4] She reduced her public commitments in 2000 following hostile stories regarding rumours of her gender transition,[3][5] and after an appearance as Millar at the 2002 Commonwealth Games left public life altogether.[3] In the 2010s, having transitioned to living as York, she returned to journalism, publishing under the name of Robert Millar until a decision to appear on television commentary and reveal her transition publicly in 2017.[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and amateur career\n2 Professional career\n\n2.1 1980\u20131982: Early years\n2.2 1983: Tour de France debut\n2.3 1984: York's best Tour de France\n2.4 1985: The \u201cstolen Vuelta\u201d\n2.5 1986: Vuelta runner up again\n2.6 1987: Giro d'Italia\n2.7 1988\n2.8 1989: A third Tour stage win\n2.9 1990: Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9\n2.10 1991\n2.11 1992\u201395: Later racing career\n\n\n3 After racing\n\n3.1 Absence from public life\n3.2 Re-emergence\n\n\n4 In popular culture\n5 Personal life\n6 Career achievements\n\n6.1 Major results\n\n6.1.1 General classification results timeline\n\n\n6.2 Honours\n\n\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 Bibliography\n10 External links\n\n\nEarly life and amateur career[edit]\nYork was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland, as Robert Millar. At one time destined for a career as a factory engineer, York attended Shawlands Academy in the south of the city.[6] In 2017, York revealed that she had first felt \"different\" aged five, but was unaware that this difference came from discomfort with her gender.[1]\nShe initially began riding for Glenmarnock Wheelers cycling club and quickly established herself as a leading amateur road racing rider. As Robert Millar, she was a relatively small man meaning she had comparatively less weight to carry uphill and she excelled as a specialist hill and mountain cyclist. She won the Scottish junior title in 1976 and was Scottish hill-climb champion the following year. In 1978, York established herself on the British scene. She was twenty-first in the Milk Race, and won the British amateur road race championship. She moved to France in 1979 to join the Athletic Club de Boulogne Billancourt (A.C.B.B.), one of Europe's top amateur teams, and quickly began winning races such the Grand Prix de la Ville de Lillers.\nIn 1979, after retaining her British road title,[7] taking fourth place in the world amateur road championship,[8] claiming five wins in France and winning the French 'Best Amateur' Trophy, she turned professional for the Peugeot cycling team, and as a climbing specialist focused on single-day road races and stage races in hilly or mountainous terrain. York was happy to travel abroad and wasn't homesick. As Millar, she married a French woman and lived with her in France.[3]\n\nProfessional career[edit]\n1980\u20131982: Early years[edit]\nYork's 1980 debut pro season included second in the Tour du Vaucluse to Michel Laurent and eighth in a race in which she would finish in the top ten overall in her career seven times, the Tour de Romandie. Returning home for the UK National Championship, she finished fifth.\nIn 1981 she improved one place on the year before with her seventh place in the Tour de Romandie. 1981 was her first prominent finish in another race in which she would again consistently impress, the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9. York finished seventh as per the Tour de Romandie and was the first of six occasions in which she would end the Dauphin\u00e9 in the top ten in the General Classification.1982 saw York again finish seventh in the Tour de Romandie. In the second year of the under-23 Tour de l'Avenir being opened to professionals, York finished second to Greg LeMond.\n\n1983: Tour de France debut[edit]\nIn 1983 York came second in the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 with LeMond again finishing a place above her.[citation needed] With her impressive June showing in the Dauphine, York was selected for the Tour de France for the first time. Any hopes of a high placing in the tour General Classification ended on stage three when she crashed losing seventeen minutes. 11 July was that year's tour first mountainous race crossing the Aubisque, Tourmalet, Aspin, and Peyresourde in the Pyrenees on stage ten. The only Pyrenean stage of that tour, York won the day six seconds ahead of Pedro Delgado. York finished fourteenth overall, twenty-three minutes behind the winner, Laurent Fignon and sandwiched in between two riders who would figure prominently in her career, Stephen Roche in thirteenth and Delgado in fifteenth. York's debut grand tour gave her third in the mountains classification, one place above Delgado like in the General Classification with Lucien Van Impe taking the polka dot jersey.\n\n1984: York's best Tour de France[edit]\n1984 saw continued improvement. In the early season Paris\u2013Nice, she and her team-mates finished second in the stage four team time trial. Two days later York finished second on a 64\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) stage ending on Mont Ventoux putting her in the overall lead at that point. She ended the race in sixth overall behind winner Sean Kelly, Stephen Roche, Bernard Hinault, Michel Laurent and Phil Anderson. In the Tour de Romandie second stage at Crans Montana she beat Pascal Simon into second place. Roche won the race with York finishing in fifth. York took the mountains competition. York also enjoyed success in the Grand Prix du Midi Libre winning a stage and finishing fourth overall.\nThen came York's best Tour de France. Stage eleven again began at Pau. After crossing the climbs of the Portet d'Aspet, Core and Latrape, York won the stage finishing with a climb to Guzet-Neige ski station. She was forty-one seconds ahead of Luis Herrera with Delgado a further twenty seconds behind in third.[9] York finished fourth overall (surpassing Tom Simpson's sixth place in the 1960s as the best British finish at the time) with Fignon winning for the second successive year and Hinault and LeMond also ahead of York. Kelly was a place behind York in fifth. York won the \"King of the Mountains\" polka dot jersey, the first time a native English speaker had won this jersey.\nOn 2 September was York's best finish in the UCI World Championships. Raced in Barcelona, York finished sixth with winner Claude Criquielion, Claudio Corti and Steve Bauer taking the podium places. Other races that year included second in the Tour du Haut Var to Eric Caritoux and second in Nice\u00a0\u2013 Alassio to Roche.[10] York finished seventh in the Volta a Catalunya, won by Kelly.\n\n1985: The \u201cstolen Vuelta\u201d[edit]\nIn 1985, the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a was still held in its April\u00a0\u2013 May slot as the first of the three grand tours of the season. York took over the race lead on stage ten, a stage won by Kelly. York held the lead going into what has become one of the most infamous days' racing in the history of the event.[3] York started the day just ten seconds ahead of Francisco Rodr\u00edguez with Spain's Pello Ruiz Cabestany 65 seconds further behind in third. With the following day's last stage of the race little more than ceremonial, York said to the press, \"I just have to stick to Pacho Rodr\u00edguez's wheel and it's done.\" A mountainous stage with three major climbs, Rodriguez tried but was unable to make any inroads on York on the first climb of the day, the Morcuera. At the foot of the second climb, the Cotos, York punctured, meaning once the puncture had been tackled York had to chase to get back to Rodriguez and Cabestany. By the time riders reached the third climb, Los Leones, York had not only reached Rodriguez and Cabestany but was also taking their congratulations, indicating their acceptance of the race being effectively over as a contest.[11]\nHowever, York was unaware that Delgado, in the mountains around his Segovia home town that he knew so well, had launched an attack. None of the riders in York's group made York aware of the attack by Delgado, an elite specialist climber like York, with the knowledge of the roads allowing him to descend aggressively. Delgado had support in his break from a second rider, Jose Recio. Delgado had started the day in sixth place and six minutes behind York. Working with Recio, Delgado was now nearly seven minutes ahead of York on the road. York had no team-mates in the group with Rodriguez and Cabestany as they had been unable to keep up. Recio won the stage and Delgado took overall lead of the race by thirty-six seconds from York.[12] With the race being referred to as \"The Stolen Vuelta', from the collusion among the Spanish-speaking riders, York finished second overall.[13] Peugeot directeur sportif, Roland Berland, said \"It's rotten, the whole peloton was against us. It seems a Spaniard had to win at all costs.\" L'\u00c9quipe's Philip Bouvet stated York was \"the victim of a formidable Spanish coalition\". York said afterwards \"I'll never return to Spain\".[14] In the television documentary on the career of Robert Millar, \"The High Life\", York criticised Berland for his handling of the situation on the road when Delgado attacked, stating that Berland had been unable to negotiate support from other non-Spanish speaking teams during the stage to give York the required support to chase down Delgado's lead.\nEarlier that year, York had come sixth once more in the early season Paris\u2013Nice, with Kelly again winning in his run of seven successive victories in the event. In the Tour de France, York finished eleventh. In September, York was overall winner of the Volta a Catalunya, taking the leader's jersey on the penultimate stage, a 22\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) individual time trial at Tortosa. York beat Sean Kelly, the previous overall winner, by three seconds.[15] In the Giro del Piemonte, York finished third behind Charly Mottet. In the Tour du Haut Var, York ended seventh, with Mottet again the victor. York was fourth in the Grand Prix de Wallonie (won by Marc Madiot). York was sixth in two races won by Stephen Roche, the Tour Midi-Pyrenees\u00a0\u2013 now known as the Route du Sud\u00a0\u2013 and the Crit\u00e9rium International. In the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, York placed ninth behind a winning Phil Anderson.\n\n1986: Vuelta runner up again[edit]\nYork changed teams in 1986 to ride for Panasonic. Despite her previous comment after the '85 race, she again rode in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. York won stage six from Santander to Lagos de Covadonga putting her into the leader's jersey. On stage eleven however, a 29\u00a0km (18\u00a0mi) time trial at Valladolid, Alvaro Pino took over the lead and retained this to the finish with York finishing second overall like she had the year before. The winning margin was one minute and six seconds.\nIn the Tour de France York was racing well even before the race reached the mountains with a third in the team time trial and ninth in the individual time trial on stage nine. York was placed tenth at this point. This improved further in the Pyrenees on stage thirteen from Pau crossing the Tourmalet, the Aspin, the Peyresourde and finishing at Superbagneres. York finished second on the day to eventual winner of the race, Greg Lemond. This placed York in fourth overall at this point and in the lead in the mountains competition.[16] She retained this to the end of stage seventeen between Gap and Serre Chevalier. However York was battling illness and began to spiral down the placings in a struggle just to stay in the race. In the stage twenty time trial, in contrast to the ninth place in the earlier time trial, York placed 112th over ten minutes behind the stage winner (Hinault). York started stage twenty-one in fifteenth overall but climbed off her bike to abandon the race before the conical final climb of the day up the Puy de D\u00f4me.\nIn other races, York finished second overall in the Tour de Suisse behind Andrew Hampsten. York was sixth in the Vuelta a Arag\u00f3n and seventh in the Escalada a Montju\u00efc.\n\n1987: Giro d'Italia[edit]\nIn 1987 York rode the Giro d'Italia for the only time in her career. The race provided high drama due to the controversy between two riders on the same Carrera team, Roberto Visentini and Roche.[17] The two teammates battled each other, but the presence of York and her own Panasonic team-mate, Erik Breukink, challenging for the race made this risky. York won stage 21 in a three-man breakaway with Roche and Marino Lejarreta. The result moved her up to second overall and gave Roche the win as Visentini fell, broke his wrist and lost six more minutes on what was to be his last day in the race.[17] York also took the climber's green jersey. In the Tour de Romandie, York finished fourth, a race won by Roche as was the Tour de France. York finished nineteenth in the Tour de France, although at the end of stage fourteen from Pau to Luz Ardiden York again enjoyed her zenith in the race when she was fifth overall. Like the year before she had been helped by a strong showing in the first individual time trial. However, York slipped to fifth, then sixth, before on stage nineteen she lost over fifteen minutes to slide out of contention. Elsewhere York was fifth in Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge with Moreno Argentin winning for the third year running. York was sixth in the Tour of the Mediterranean (Gerrit Solleveld won) and seventh in the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme behind  winner Vicent Belda.\n\n1988[edit]\nIn 1988, York joined the French Fagor team as had Roche and Schepers. York managed her best position in a one-day 'Monument' Classic, third in Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge behind Adri van der Poel. York returned to the Vuelta a Espana and finished sixth overall with Kelly winning.\nIn the Tour de France, after struggling in the Alps, on stage fourteen she lost the opportunity of a repeat Pyrenees stage win in Guzet-Neige. York led over each of the first two climbs from Blagnac. In sprinting uphill to the finish with Phillipe Bouvatier, both riders mistook a gendarme's signals, took a wrong turn and ceded the win to Massimo Ghirotto. York finished in second on the day two seconds behind. The next day York was again riding at the front when leading over the second climb but cracked and finished twenty-one minutes behind. Stage seventeen was the last she would complete that year.\nHigh placings that year were second in the Bicicleta Vasca included third in each of the Crit\u00e9rium International and the Route de Sud (Ronan Pensec won). York was eighth in Volta a Catalunya] and ninth in Paris\u00a0\u2013 Nice.\n\n1989: A third Tour stage win[edit]\nYork returned to one of her previous teams, Z-Peugeot as it was now known and was second overall behind Mottet after winning stage seven in the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9. York was a stage winner in the Tour de Romandie and a runner-up in the Grand Prix de Wallonie to Thomas Wegm\u00fcller.\nShe rode only one grand tour for the first time since 1984, and she had her best placing in the tour since the 1984 race. She won stage ten of the 1989 Tour de France from Cauterets to Superbagn\u00e8res. York was first to the top of all four of that days climbs scaling the Tourmalet, Aspin, and Peyresourde before the Superbagneres finish. Charly Mottet was dropped from the three-man group approaching the finish leaving York to out sprint Delgado at the line. York was placed eighth at this point and ended that year's tour in tenth. In the autumn York was overall winner in the Tour of Britain with her decisive move coming in a long two-man breakaway with Mauro Gianetti into Cardiff. Gianetti took the sprint for the stage but York comfortably stayed in yellow for the rest of the race. Other top ten placings included eighth in the Tour de Vaucluse (Rooks won) and ninth in the Grand Prix of the Americas.\n\n1990: Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9[edit]\nVictory in the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 arrived in 1990. York was in a stage six, two-person breakaway with Thierry Claveyrolat. Both riders finished in the top five in the leading group the next day. Stage eight was an individual time trial and despite strong time trialists being in the peloton such as Roche and Toni Rominger, York took the overall title with Claveyrolat the runner up.[18]\nYork was runner up for a second time in the Tour de Suisse with Kelly the victor that year. York was a stage winner in the Tour de Romandie (Mottet took overall prize). York took fourth place in the Giro di Lombardia behind Gilles Delion. In between, she also took second place in the 1990 Tour of Britain hampered by a crash on the last day. In the Tour de France York rode as part of the team intended to support the previous year's winner and reigning world champion, Greg LeMond. The Z team not only helped deliver the yellow jersey for LeMond but also won the team competition. York though was denied the yellow cap award from the competition her team led from stage ten onwards. Stage fourteen was the last she completed on the tour that year. This was York's third and last withdrawal from the eleven times she rode the tour. Other placings in the top ten that year included fourth in the Vuelta a Andaluc\u00eda and ninth in La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne.\n\n1991[edit]\nYork won a stage in the 1991 Tour de Suisse and finished fifth overall. That year was her best overall finish in the Tour de Romandie, second, with Rominger the man denying York the title. She was second in the debut edition of the Classique des Alpes, fourth in the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, fourth in the Tour of Britain and fifth in the Grand Prix of the Americas. She finished the Tour de France in seventy-second place, the only one of her eight finishes in the tour that was outside the top twenty-five.\n\n1992\u201395: Later racing career[edit]\nIn 1992, York revealed her vegetarianism, which was an intention to improve her performance on the bike. \"It's not a principle\u00a0\u2013 it's a personal thing. I've read a lot of books about it\".[19] York completed the Tour de France in 1992 (18th) and 1993 (24th), and the Vuelta in 1992 (20th) and 1993 (15th).\nIn a time when doping was common and bans shorter, York tested positive for testosterone after a stage of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, in 1992. She was fined \u00a31,100, lost her third place on the stage, incurred a 10-minute time penalty and was given a three-month suspended ban.[20]\nIn the final years of her career, she achieved top ten finishes in the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, Giro del Piemonti and Liege\u00a0\u2013 Bastogne\u00a0\u2013 Liege (all in 1992), and the Classiques des Alpes and the Midi Libre (both in 1993). However, further victories largely eluded her. Her final major victory came in June 1995 when she won the National Road Race Championship. However, soon afterwards, her French team Le Groupement went bust and York retired from racing.\n\nAfter racing[edit]\nIn 1997, York became the coach of the British national team, and in 1998 managed the Scottish team in the Tour of Britain, an eight-day round-Britain stage race. She also worked in journalism, writing for several cycling magazines.[21]\n\nAbsence from public life[edit]\nYork and her wife were believed to have separated in the late 1990s.[22] In 2000, a tabloid news story reported that York, still known publicly as Robert Millar, was now living as a woman.[23] The story hurt York, who reduced her connections with cycling, though still kept up some writing[22] and appeared at the 2002 Commonwealth Games as Millar. Following this, however, she receded further from view and cut her ties with cycling. In 2007, journalist Richard Moore wrote a biography of York titled In Search of Robert Millar. After initially refusing to respond, York did answer some of Moore's questions via email, though dramatically cut off contact.[23][3] At the time, Moore wrote that \"It is impossible to put a date on Millar's disappearance. It was more a fade-out than a vanishing act...  These days, Millar is in very occasional email contact with one or two former acquaintances but his whereabouts are a mystery\".[4]\n\nRe-emergence[edit]\nYork partially returned to journalism in the 2010s, writing a blog for Cyclingnews[24] and later writing occasionally for other publications including The Guardian.[1] She remained a private figure, but following her announcement of her gender transition  joined the ITV4 commentary team for the 2017 Tour de France.[1]\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nDuring the mid-1980s Millar appeared in television commercials for Kellogg's 'Start' cereal. A one-hour Granada Television documentary about Millar's 1985 racing season, entitled The High Life, which also included appearances by Allan Peiper and music by Steve Winwood, was screened in Britain on the eve of the 1986 Tour de France.\nRobert Millar\u00a0\u2013 The High Life was rediscovered and screened, simultaneously with the release of the book, at Edinburgh Bike Week Film Festival on 26 June 2007.[25] A DVD version of the documentary was released in 2008.[26] In 2011, Millar authored analytical opinions for Cyclingnews during the Tour de France.[27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAs Millar, York married a French woman, Sylvie Transler, in December 1985. No-one from York's family was in attendance, nor were any of her team-mates, who had no idea she even had a girlfriend. Panasonic team-mate Phil Anderson commented, \"He didn't seem to have the skills for getting on with men, let alone women\".[28] The couple were believed to have separated by the late 1990s.[22]\nAs a cyclist, York had a reputation for being taciturn and could be uncooperative with the media. Jeff Connor, author of Wide Eyed & Legless: Inside the Tour de France was told to \"fuck off\" when requesting an interview during the 1987 Tour de France. When told this, commentator Phil Liggett replied, \"That sounds like Millar, he's been really awkward with us in the past. Personally, I think it's a disgrace. He has a duty to his sponsor to represent the team and you don't do that by telling journalists to 'fuck off'.\"[29] During commentary for Stage 23 of the 1987 Tour de France, Liggett stated \"[It has been a] very disappointing Tour for Robert. He has lost a lot of popularity, too, one has to say. He won't speak to journalists and the team itself [Panasonic] is also becoming discontented with Robert this year.\" York subsequently left Panasonic at the end of the 1987 season, to join Fagor.[30]\nYork's 'disappearance' during the 2000s was at the time attributed to her insularity and eccentricity.[3] At the time, rumours of her gender transition were largely disregarded.[3][22] On 6 July 2017, in a statement on Cyclingnews, York confirmed her gender transition.[5] She wrote that:\n\nAs much as I've guarded my privacy over the years there are a few, I believe obvious, reasons to why I haven't had a public \"image\" since I transitioned. Gratifyingly, times have moved on from ten years ago when my family, friends and I were subjected to the archaic views and prejudice that some people and certain sections of the tabloid media held...While there has been some speculation concerning my gender over the past decade, perhaps it'll now be better understood why unwelcome and unasked for intrusions into that transition have been damaging not only to myself but to those I love.[5]\nYork is the first former professional cyclist to have publicly changed gender.[1]\n\nCareer achievements[edit]\nMajor

To help support the family, Zyrus began to enter singing contests at the age of seven, from town fiestas in various provinces to singing competitions on TV,[9] eventually competing in almost a hundred such contests.[10]\nIn 2005, Zyrus joined Little Big Star, a talent show in the Philippines loosely patterned after American Idol. Eliminated after the first performance, Zyrus was called back as a wildcard contender and eventually became one of the finalists. Although a consistent top scorer in the final rounds, Zyrus did not win the title in the finale, placing third.[11]\nZyrus made some minor appearances on local television shows and commercials, but essentially fell off the radar after Little Big Star. Only in 2007 did Zyrus gain worldwide recognition after an avid supporter, FalseVoice, started posting a series of performances on YouTube. These videos received over 15 million hits, making Zyrus an internet sensation.[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\n2007\u20132008: Discovery and early work[edit]\nIn June 2007, producers at Ten Songs/Productions, a music publishing company in Sweden, invited Zyrus to a demo-recording seeing online videos.

In an ABC News interview, David Foster mentioned Zyrus's ability to mimic other people's voices, which, according to him, is a characteristic of good singers.[102] In a separate interview, Josh Groban stated that Zyrus's voice is one of the most beautiful he had heard in a long time.[103] Ryan Murphy, the executive music producer of the hit US television series Glee, said, \"When that girl opens her mouth, angels fly out.\" Oprah's bookazine, Oprah's Farewell Celebration: Inside 25 Extraordinary Years of 'The Oprah Winfrey Show', mentioned Zyrus's \"soaring soprano voice\".[104] However, since his transition from female to male, Zyrus has been known for his \"increasingly confident tenor\".[105]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRaised in the Iglesia ni Cristo faith, Zyrus and younger brother Carl were baptized and confirmed into their mother's Roman Catholic faith on May 22, 2010, 12 days after Zyrus's 18th birthday, at the Pasig Cathedral in Pasig,  Metro Manila, Philippines.

Ricky had been at a small grocery store in San Pedro, Laguna, a city south of Metro Manila, when he brushed against a drunk man who became angry and stabbed him with an ice pick in the chest and back, according to the Laguna province police chief. Zyrus responded to the stabbing on Twitter:  \"I want to thank my fans from around the world for their support and love at this very difficult time for my family and I.\"  \"We are all very sad about this terrible tragedy\" and \"I loved him and I will still love him\"; \"He's still my Dad after all.\"[108]\nZyrus' exploration of his gender identity was a subject of public interest. In March 2012, Zyrus faced harsh criticism from the Internet and the media after changing his hairstyle and fashion into a self-described \"edgy and rock\" look, responding: \"I know some people think that this is very rebellious but it's not. It's just me evolving.\"[109] On April 16, 2013, questions were raised after pictures surfaced online of Zyrus in masculine dress.[110][111][112] In an interview, mother Raquel Pempengco said that she would respect her child's decision about his own identity.[113][114] On May 28, The Philippine Star newspaper ran a story about Zyrus's 21st birthday party which was described as a \"coming out of sorts\".[115] On June 2, 2013, Zyrus said that he identified as lesbian at that time during an interview with Boy Abunda at The Buzz in the Philippines, mentioning past relationships with other women in the industry.[116][117][118] Nine months later, in March 2014, Zyrus debuted a new \"boyish\" look with much shorter hair cut and more tattoos.[119]   In a 2014 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Zyrus mentioned being attracted to girls since childhood and said \"basically, my soul is male\", but denied plans to pursue gender transition at that time.[120]\nIn April 2017, Zyrus broke up with Alyssa Quijano, after four years of living together.[121] In June 2017, Zyrus announced the adopting of his current name and discontinued the use of Charice, a name he previously went by, on Twitter and Instagram.[1][2][3] Subsequently, Zyrus disclosed that he had undergone removal of both breasts in March, and had begun testosterone shots in April.[7] In an interview with Papermag, he said \"I am always thankful for the life of Charice that I experienced and the music that I shared, but that obviously belongs to her, it's not for me.

He blends mythical, fantasy, and traditional themes in performances, switching between instrumental fiddle and songs accompanied by guitar, bodhr\u00e1n, and fiddle playing. He has also been a popular and influential artist in the field of filk music and won multiple Pegasus awards.\nAdams performed as Heather Alexander for 25 years before beginning to tour as Alexander James Adams.[1][2][3]  His website refers to him as the \"heir\" to Heather Alexander,[4] and continues to credit songs originally released as Heather Alexander under that name.[5]\nThe last public performance under the name Heather was at OryCon 2006. His debut as Alexander James Adams was at Seattle's Norwescon 30, on April 6, 2007.\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n\n1.1 Mid 1980s - 2006\n1.2 2007\u2013present\n\n\n2 Literary collaborations and references\n3 Awards\n4 Discography\n\n4.1 Solo albums\n4.2 Band albums\n4.3 DVD\n4.4 Books\n4.5 Guest appearances\n\n\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nMid 1980s - 2006[edit]\n Alexander James Adams at a performance in April 2007\nA native of California, Alexander began performing original music in the mid-eighties for friends, Renaissance fairs, and science fiction conventions.  Off Centaur Publications was recording performances at one convention and asked to include Alexander. This began an association where Alexander recorded for Off Centaur and later Firebird Arts and Music, primarily work for hire.[6]\nIn the late 1980s Alexander co-founded the Celtic fusion rock band Phoenyx, which released one album, Keepers of the Flame.  The band disbanded in 1991 after achieving a high degree of local fame, and that album is no longer in print.[7]\nAlexander returned to a solo career. Firebird Arts & Music produced a live album which did well enough to inspire Alexander to create a label (Sea Fire Productions, Inc.) for the release Wanderlust 1994. Two live concert albums and several studio albums have followed.[6][8] Alexander also moved to the Pacific Northwest, settling in Banks, Oregon in 2002.\nIn 2001, Alexander founded a new band, Uffington Horse, together with Andrew Hare and Dan Ochipinti and continued to perform solo gigs between band appearances. In 2004, a limited run of the Uffington Horse promotional CD was offered to fans to help finance recording their first studio album, Enchantment, published in 2004.[8] In 2002, Heather Alexander told Strange Horizons that \"I tend to think of myself as a 'musical entertainer.' I sing, play, compose, and tell stories.\"[6]\n\n2007\u2013present[edit]\nIn early 2007 Adams transitioned to male and since April 2007 has performed in many of the venues that he had formerly played as Heather Alexander. He has played with Uffington Horse and has also formed a new band, Tricky Pixie, with S.J. Tucker and Betsy Tinney.  In summer 2007, the band released a recording of their first concert, Live!, which is the earliest released recording of Adams' post-transition voice.[9]\n\n Alexander James Adams at Conflikt in January 2010\nAdams' first post-transition solo album, Cat & The Fiddle, was entirely instrumental. Balance of Nature, released in fall 2007, mixed a few of his older works (such as \"Creature of the Wood\") with new songs.\nIn November 2007, Adams released the Yule album Wintertide, featuring duets between both Adams' and Heather Alexander's voices.  As noted in Adams' interview in Just Out, Wintertide is the first album with a series of these duets.[2] A Familiar Promise, released in July 2008, also includes duets between both voices.\n\n\nLiterary collaborations and references[edit]\nSeveral of the Firebird Arts and Music albums include collaborations with Mercedes Lackey and inspired by the works of Andre Norton.  (See the discography below for more information.)\nThe 2002 album Insh'Allah was inspired by Steven Barnes's novel Lion's Blood. The songs and the book were written concurrently, and several of the songs are quoted in the book and its sequel.[6]\nIn a similar vein, the 2006 album Merlin's Descendants is based on the fiction of Irene Radford.[8][10]\nS.M. Stirling quotes Alexander's song lyrics in his Island in the Sea of Time trilogy.  His Emberverse series features a red-haired musician who plays guitar, fiddle, and bodhran named Juniper Mackenzie. Alexander's song lyrics are used as Mackenzie's songs in the book. (Juniper and heather are both plants.)[11]\nJohn Ringo quotes Alexander's song \"March of Cambreadth\" in his Council Wars series (for the Centurions' battle song) as well as in the Paladin of Shadows series.[12] \"March of Cambreadth\" and \"Black Unicorn\" are also quoted in the Looking Glass series.\nMike Shepherd used the song \"March of Cambreadth\" in his book Defiant.  Defiant also has a character named Heather Alexander.\nSeveral of his songs have been parodied, most notably \"March of Cambreadth\".\n\nAwards[edit]\nHeather Alexander \n\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nNominee/Song\n\nResult\n\n\n1995\n\nPegasus Award[13]\n\nBest Performer\n\nHeather Alexander\n\nNominated\n\n\n1996\n\nPegasus Award\n\nBest Writer/Composer\n\nHeather Alexander\n\nWon\n\n\n1996\n\nPegasus Award\n\nBest Performer\n\nHeather Alexander\n\nWon\n\n\n1998\n\nPegasus Award\n\nBest Myth Song\n\n\"Midsummer\"\n\nNominated\n\n\n1998\n\nPegasus Award\n\nBest Adaptation\n\nDemonsbane w/ Mercedes Lackey\n\nNominated\n\n\n2006\n\nPegasus Award\n\nBest Battle Song\n\n\"March of Cambreadth\"\n\nWon\n\n\n2018\n\nPegasus Award\n\nBest Classic Filk Song\n\n\"Creature of the Wood\"\n\nWon\n\nAlexander James Adams\n\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nNominees & Recipients\n\nResult\n\n\n2011\n\nPegasus Award[14]\n\nBest Performer\n\nTricky Pixie\n\nNominated\n\n\n2013\n\nPegasus Award\n\nBest Performer\n\nAlexander James Adams\n\nWon\n\nDiscography[edit]\nThe albums listed through Everafter are billed as Heather Alexander.

At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings.\nAlcorn used Tumblr's timer feature to publish her suicide note online several hours after her death, and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media. LGBT rights activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth, while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom. Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of \"Leelah's Law\", a ban on conversion therapy in the United States, which received a supportive response from then-president Barack Obama. Within a year, the city of Cincinnati criminalized conversion therapy. Alcorn's parents were severely criticized for misgendering her in comments to the media, while LGBT rights activist Dan Savage blamed them for their child's death, and social media users harassed them online. They defended their refusal to accept Alcorn's identity and their use of conversion therapy by reference to their Christian beliefs.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Death\n3 Reaction\n\n3.1 Alcorn's parents\n3.2 Tributes, vigils, and activism\n3.3 Leelah's Law\n\n\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\n\n\"When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self [sic]. That's exactly what it did to me.\"\n\u2014 Alcorn's suicide note[1]\n\n\nLeelah Alcorn was born in Kings Mills, Ohio, on November 15, 1997.[2] She described herself as one of several children being raised in a conservative Christian environment;[3][4] she and her family attended the Northeast Church of Christ in Cincinnati, and she had been featured in a profile of that church published in a 2011 article in The Christian Chronicle.[5] As of 2014, the family lived in Kings Mills.[6] According to her suicide note, Alcorn had felt \"like a girl trapped in a boy's body\" since she was four, and came to identify as a transgender girl from the age of 14, when she became aware of the term.[1] She rejected the name she was given by her parents, and signed her suicide note \"(Leelah) Josh Alcorn\".[1][7] According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted \"extremely negatively\" by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman.[1][7] She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression.[1]\nAlcorn's mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists,[8][9] but Alcorn later related that there she only encountered \"more Christians\" telling her that she was \"selfish and wrong\" and \"should look to God for help\".[1] Aged 16, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, \"I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.\"[1] Alcorn publicly revealed her attraction to males when she was 16, as she believed that identifying as a gay male at that point would be a stepping stone to coming out as a transgender female at a later date.[10][11] According to a childhood friend, Alcorn received a positive reception from many at Kings High School, although her parents were appalled.[11] In Alcorn's words, \"They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight Christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted.\"[1][10] They removed her from the school and enrolled her as an eleventh grader at the Ohio Virtual Academy online school.[10]\nAccording to Alcorn, her parents cut her off from the outside world for five months as they denied her access to social media and many forms of communication. She described this as a significant contributing factor towards her suicide.[1] At the end of the school year, they returned her mobile phone to her and allowed her to regain contact with her friends, although by this time, according to Alcorn, her relationship with many of them had become strained, and she continued to feel isolated.[1] Two months before her death, Alcorn sought out help on Reddit, asking users whether the treatment perpetrated by her parents constituted child abuse.[12][13] There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, \"they always talked to me in a very derogatory tone\" and \"would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive.\"[13] Further, she explained, \"I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents.\"[14] On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant Prozac.[13] In concluding her post, she wrote, \"Please help me, I don't know what I should do and I can't take much more of this.\"[15] Alcorn's computer was recovered near the site of her suicide. It contained conversations showing that she had planned to jump off the bridge that crosses Interstate 71 days before the incident, but then contacted a crisis hotline and, as told to a friend, \"basically cried [her] eyes out for a couple of hours talking to a lady there\".[16]\n\nDeath[edit]\nPrior to her death on December 28, 2014, Alcorn scheduled for her suicide note to be automatically posted on her Tumblr account at 5:30\u00a0pm.[10] In the note, she stated her intention to end her life, commenting:\n\nI have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say \"it gets better\" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me.[1]\nShe expressed her wish that all of her possessions and money be donated to a transgender advocacy charity,[1] and called for issues surrounding gender identity to be taught in schools.[1][9]\nThe note ended with the statement: \"My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that's fucked up' and fix it. Fix society. Please.\"[1][9][17] A second post appeared shortly after; titled \"Sorry\", it featured an apology to her close friends and siblings for the trauma that her suicide would put them through, but also contained a message to her parents: \"Fuck you. You can't just control other people like that. That's messed up.\"[1][18][19][20] An additional, handwritten suicide note reading \"I've had enough\" was found on her bed, but then thrown away by Alcorn's mother after police made a copy.[16]\nIn the early morning of December 28, police informed news sources that she had been walking southbound on Interstate 71 near Union Township when she was struck by a semi-trailer just before 2:30 am near the South Lebanon exit.[21] She died at the scene. It is believed that Alcorn walked three to four miles from her parents' Kings Mill house, before being struck.[6] The highway was closed for more than an hour after the incident.[10] An investigation was launched by the Ohio State Highway Patrol,[21] while Alcorn's body was transported to the Montgomery County coroner, where an autopsy was scheduled.[10] The truck driver was uninjured in the incident.[22]\nWithin 48 hours of the posting of her suicide note, it had attracted 82,272 views,[10] and by the morning of December 31, it had been reposted on Tumblr 200,000 times.[9] Writing for the Boston Globe, the reporter Maura Johnston described it as a \"passionate post\".[9] The suicide note was later deleted after Alcorn's parents asked for it to be removed,[23] and the blog was made inaccessible to the public.[24] According to the family minister, the Alcorn family decided to hold the funeral privately after receiving threats.[25] Alcorn's body was reportedly cremated.[25] The Ohio State Patrol completed their investigation into Alcorn's death on April 30, 2015, officially ruling it a suicide.[16]\n\nReaction[edit]\nAlcorn's parents[edit]\nOn December 28 at 2:56\u00a0p.m., Alcorn's mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, posted a public message on the social media website Facebook, stating: \"My sweet 16-year-old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn, went home to Heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck. Thank you for the messages and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your prayers.\"[10][11][22] Carla Alcorn's post was subsequently deleted, and her Facebook account was made private.[22] The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the Kings Local School District.[10] In that statement, staff from Alcorn's former school, Kings High School, declared that \"Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old\", adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident.[10] A moment of silence was held in Alcorn's memory before a Kings High basketball game on December 30.[11]\n\n LGBT rights advocate Dan Savage called for Leelah's parents to face legal prosecution in the wake of their daughter's death.\nSome of Alcorn's sympathizers publicly criticized the teen's mother, Carla Alcorn, for misgendering her daughter in the Facebook post announcing the teenager's death.[26] Some individuals\u2014termed \"the Internet's self-appointed vigilantes\" in The Washington Post\u2014subsequently doxed and harassed Carla via her Facebook account \"in revenge\" for Leelah's death.[27] On Twitter, American gay rights activist Dan Savage argued that Alcorn's parents should be prosecuted for their role in bringing about their daughter's death, commenting that through their actions they \"threw her in front of that truck\". He cited the successful prosecution of Dharun Ravi following the suicide of Tyler Clementi as a legal precedent for such an action.[28][29][30] He added that legal action should also be brought against the conversion therapists who had counseled Leelah, and suggested that the Alcorns should lose custody of their other children.[2][28]\nCarla Alcorn responded to such criticism in an interview with CNN, stating \"we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy.\"[17][31][32] Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name \"Leelah\", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding \"We don't support that, religiously.\"[17][31][32] She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a \"horrible person\", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to \"inappropriate\" things.[31] In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, \"We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death. We have no desire to enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him. We wish to grieve in private. We harbor no ill will towards anyone. ... I simply do not wish our words to be used against us.\"[5]\nWriting for Salon, Mary Elizabeth Williams commented that \"it would be cruel and inaccurate to suggest that Carla Alcorn did not love her child\", but added that Carla's statement that she \"loved him unconditionally\" revealed \"a tragic lack of understanding of the word 'unconditionally', even in death\".[33] People magazine quoted Johanna Olson, Medical Director for the Center of Trans Youth Health and Development at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, as stating that \"Did Leelah's parents love her? Yes, I'm sure they did. Did they support her? No, they didn't. And that's a tragedy.\"[30] Mara Keisling, the Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, was quoted as stating that the blaming of Alcorn's parents was unhelpful, adding, \"Despite the great cultural and policy advances transgender people have made, there is still a lot of disrespect, discrimination and violence aimed at us. And being a child or a teenager of any kind today is very difficult.\"[7]\n\nTributes, vigils, and activism[edit]\n A memorial placed against a wall following the London vigil, January 2015\nThe day after Alcorn's suicide note was published online, Chris Seelbach, the first openly gay councilman on Cincinnati City Council, shared it as part of a Facebook message in which he stated that her death showed how hard it was to be transgender in the U.S. His post was shared over 4,700 times and increased public awareness of the incident.[9][10][11] By December 30, Alcorn's death had attracted worldwide attention.[10] News outlets across the world had picked up the story, and the hashtag #LeelahAlcorn had topped Twitter.[10] According to British newspaper The Independent, the incident \"triggered widespread anguish and raised a debate about the rights of transgender people\".[17] The U.S.-based Boston Globe stated that it \"served as a flashpoint for transgender progress in 2014\",[9] while The New Republic referred to it as having \"sparked a national conversation about the plight of transgender kids and the scanty rights and respect our society affords them.\"[34]\nOn January 1, 2015, the Cincinnati-based LGBT rights group Support Marriage Equality Ohio hosted a vigil for Alcorn outside Kings High School.[5][35] A candlelight vigil in Goodale Park, Columbus, was held on January 2 by a group called Stand Up 4 Leelah.[35] A further vigil was organized by both The Diverse City Youth Chorus in partnership with the Cincinnati chapter of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center for January 10.[35] The vigil location at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center was moved to the Woodward Theater, to make way for a larger setting.[36][37] The event was attended by over 500 people.[38]\nA January 3 vigil was scheduled for Trafalgar Square in London; an organizer was quoted as saying that \"[Alcorn's] death was a political death. When a member of our community is brutalised at the hands of oppression we must all fight back\".[39] Those who spoke at the event included politician Sarah Brown and novelist and poet Roz Kaveney.[40] Marches were carried out in honor of Alcorn in both Northwest, Washington, D.C., and Queen Street, Auckland, on January 10.[41][42][43] The same day, a candlelight vigil was held in New York City's Columbus Circle.[44] A memorial protest against conversion therapy and in memory of Alcorn took place in Lynchburg, Virginia, on January 24, 2015.[45]\nAmong the transgender celebrities who publicly responded to the incident were Janet Mock, Andreja Peji\u0107, and Laverne Cox,[46][47] while the musician Ray Toro released a song, \"For the Lost and Brave\", in dedication to Alcorn.[48][49] Joey Soloway, the writer of the television show Transparent, dedicated their Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series to Alcorn.[50] During Diane Sawyer's interview with Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce), which confirmed Jenner's transgender identity, Alcorn was mentioned by name and the message \"Fix society. Please\" was broadcast.[51] In June 2015, the singer Miley Cyrus founded the Happy Hippie Foundation, an organization to raise awareness of homelessness and LGBT issues among young people, partly in response to Alcorn's death.[52] To promote the organization, she released a new series of Backyard Sessions videos, the second of which, Dido's \"No Freedom\" was dedicated to Alcorn.[53] After reading about Alcorn's death, British musician Declan McKenna was inspired to write a song, \"Paracetamol\", which was included on his debut album What Do You Think About the Car? and discusses the media's representation of LGBT communities.[54]\n\nCelebrities such as Joey Soloway (left) and Laverne Cox (right) publicly responded to Alcorn's death.\nCarolyn Washburn, editor of the Ohio newspaper The Cincinnati Enquirer, stated that the incident \"raises important issues we hope will prompt conversations in families throughout our region\".[10] Washburn had also received letters that derided the newspaper's use of Alcorn's chosen name in covering her death.[55] When contacted by The Cincinnati Enquirer, Shane Morgan, the founder and chair of transgender advocate group TransOhio, stated that while 2014 witnessed gains for the trans rights movement, Alcorn's death illustrated how \"trans people are still being victimized and still being disrespected\", highlighting the high rate of transgender people who had been murdered that year.[10] Since the incident, TransOhio received letters from parents of transgender children describing how Alcorn's death had affected them.[31] Morgan stated that while he understood the anger directed toward Alcorn's parents, \"there's no excuse for threats to the family.\"[31]\nAllison Woolbert, executive director of the Transgender Human Rights Institute, informed The Independent that Alcorn's case was \"not unique\"; the newspaper highlighted research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that LGBT youth are about twice as likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual, cisgender teenagers.[2] Newsweek similarly placed Alcorn's suicide within its wider context of transphobic discrimination, highlighting that the Youth Suicide Prevention Program reports that over 50 percent of transgender youths attempt suicide before the age of 20, and that the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs recently published a report indicating that 72 percent of LGBT homicide victims in 2013 were transgender women.[47]\nKevin Jennings of the Arcus Foundation also situated Alcorn's death within wider problems facing young LGBT people. In his view, she became \"an international symbol of the ongoing challenges faced by LGBT youth\", adding that her death \"reminds us of a basic lesson still being taught to young people across America: When it comes to gender identity, it's best to be cisgender; and when it comes to sexual orientation, it's best to be straight.\"[56]\nUnder the Twitter hashtag #RealLiveTransAdult, many transgender people posted encouraging tweets for their younger counterparts,[57] while other hashtags, such as #ProtectTransKids, and the term \"Rest in Power\", also circulated on Twitter.[58][59][60] A change.org petition was set up calling for Leelah's chosen name to be included on her gravestone,[26] which gained over 80,000 signatures.[37] On January 6, Adam Hoover of Marriage Equality Ohio remarked that, since the request of having Alcorn's chosen name on her gravestone seemed \"like a slim possibility\", they would be raising money for a permanent memorial arranged as a bench, tree and commemorative plaque.[37]\nUnder Ohio's Adopt-a-Highway program, a group adopted the interchange of Interstate 71 South and Ohio State Route 48\u2014which was where Alcorn died\u2014and dedicated it to her memory. As a result, the Ohio Department of Transportation erected signs stating \"In Memory of Leelah Alcorn\" along the road.[61] Members of the group affixed a wreath to one of these signs; group member Lisa Oravec informed press that \"We don't want Leelah to be forgotten... We want people in Cincinnati, or anybody driving down 71 to see the wreath. See the highway. If they don't know who Leelah is they'll google it, educate it, and learn from what happened.\"[62] As of December 2018, the \"Leelah Alcorn Highway Memorial\" group continued to meet four times a year to clean that stretch of road.[62] The highway memorial formed the basis of a short documentary, Leelah's Highway, which was screened at the 2018 Cindependent Film Festival in Cincinnati's Woodward Theater.[63] Its creator, Elizabeth Littlejohn of Toronto, stated that \"as a human rights activist who believes [in] the right for gender self-determination, I believe this story needed to be told.\"[64]\n\nLeelah's Law[edit]\nA Facebook group called \"Justice for Leelah Alcorn\" was established,[65] while a petition calling for \"Leelah's Law\", a ban on conversion therapy in the United States, was created by the Transgender Human Rights Institute to raise awareness of the psychologically harmful effects of such practices; by January 24 it had 330,009 signatures,[66][67][68] and was named the fastest growing change.org petition of 2014.[69] A second appeal demanding the enactment of \"Leelah's Law\" was posted to the We the People section of WhiteHouse.gov on January 3, 2015, which garnered more than 100,000 signatures as of January 30.[70] In response to the petition, in April 2015 President Barack Obama called for the banning of conversion therapy for minors.[71][72][73]\nIn December 2015, Cincinnati became the second U.S. city after Washington, D.C., to ban the practice of conversion therapy outright; council member Chris Seelbach cited Alcorn's suicide as an influence in the decision and stated that \"she challenged us to make her death matter, and we're doing just that\".[74] By October 2018, four cities across Ohio had banned conversion therapy, leading journalist Nico Lang to comment that \"the Buckeye State has become an unlikely leader in banning conversion therapy at the local level.\"[75]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of LGBT-related suicides\nList of people from Ohio\nList of transgender people\nSuicide of Blake Brockington\nOhio portalTransgender portalLGBT portal\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o Alcorn, Leelah (December 28, 2014). \"Suicide Note\".

She established a boarding house in Oxnard, where she became a popular hostess. In 1945, a year after she married her second husband, she was arrested and tried and convicted of perjury, as the government said she had lied about her sex on her marriage license.[3] After release from prison, she and her husband moved to Los Angeles.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Marriages and time in Oxnard\n3 Trials\n4 Death and legacy\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nLucy Hicks Anderson was born in Waddy, Kentucky, in 1886.[4] From a very early age Anderson was adamant that she was not male, identifying as female in a time period before the term transgender existed.[5] Doctors told Lucy's parents to let her live as a young woman, so they did, and she began wearing dresses to school and being known as Lucy.[1][6]\n\nMarriages and time in Oxnard[edit]\nAt the age of 15, Lucy left school and did domestic work as a means to support herself.[4] At age 20, she headed west to Texas and then to New Mexico, where she married her first husband, Clarence Hicks, in Silver City, New Mexico.[7][6] She later moved to Oxnard, California at the age of 34.[7] A skilled chef, she won some baking contests.[6] Her marriage to Clarence lasted only nine years, but during the course of the union, she saved up enough money to buy property that was a boarding house front for a brothel; it also sold illegal liquor in Prohibition America.[7][6] Outside of her time as a Madame, she was a well-known socialite and hostess in Oxnard, and would later use her connections to avoid serious jail time. According to scholar C. Riley Snorton, \"When the sheriff arrested her one night, her double-barreled reputation paid off\u2014Charles Donlon, the town\u2019s leading banker, promptly bailed her out [because] he had scheduled a huge dinner party which would have collapsed dismally with Lucy in jail.\"[8] In 1944, Hicks remarried Rueben Anderson, a soldier stationed in Long Island, New York.[4][7]\n\nTrials[edit]\nIn 1945, a sailor claimed that he caught a venereal disease from one of the women in Anderson's brothel, so all of the women, including Anderson, were required to undergo medical examination.[6] When the Ventura County district attorney learned from this examination that Anderson had been assigned male at birth, he chose to try her for perjury, arguing that she lied about her sex on her marriage license and impersonated a woman.[4][6] During the trial, she stated \u201cI defy any doctor in the world to prove that I am not a woman,\u201d and \u201cI have lived, dressed, acted just what I am, a woman.\u201d[6] However, the court convicted her of perjury on her marriage license and sentenced her to 10 years of probation.[4] At the time, marriage was only valid between a man and a woman, and she was not deemed a woman, so the marriage was declared invalid.[6] As a result, the federal government charged her with fraud for receiving the financial allotments wives of soldiers got under the GI Bill,[4] and initially also with failing to register for the draft, until she proved she had been too old to register.[6] In this trial, she and Reuben were found guilty and sentenced to prison, where Lucy was forbidden by court order to wear women's clothes.[6]\n\nDeath and legacy[edit]\nAfter being released from prison, Anderson was barred from returning to Oxnard by the police chief, who threatened further prosecution.[6] She and Reuben relocated to Los Angeles, where they resided quietly until her death in 1954,[6][8] at 68.[5]\nThe Handbook of LGBT Elders calls Anderson \"one of the earliest documented cases of an African-American transgender person\".[4]\n\nSee also[edit]\nAfrican-American LGBT community\nTransgender rights in the United States\nHistory of transgender people in the United States\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Hannah, Jewell (2018-03-06).

Thomas attended classes at Wharton County Junior College and earned certifications in the Police Academy, Fire Academy and was an EMT. Nikki worked as a Sales Executive and Sales Manager for a Houston GLBT magazine. Thomas served Wharton as a volunteer firefighter, and after marrying Nikki, became a Sheriff's Deputy and completed courses required for paid firefighters.\nOn July 3, 2010, Captain Araguz answered the call to fight a fire at an egg plant in Boling, Texas and went missing for several hours.[3] At the time of the fire Nikki was on a business trip and was not made aware he was missing. Nikki learned of Thomas' death from a posting on a social networking site by another fireman's wife. Upon her return to Wharton, Nikki's in-laws prevented her from seeing her stepchildren.\nThe morning after Thomas' burial, Nikki learned that two separate lawsuits had been filed by his family in an attempt to take away her benefits as a firefighter's spouse, though Thomas had specifically named her as beneficiary in one instance.[4] Thomas' family claimed that since Araguz was \"born a man\", she was not female at the time of her marriage to Thomas and that the marriage should be invalidated.[5] On May 26, 2011, State District Judge Randy Clapp ruled in favor of Thomas' family and nullified the marriage.[6]\nAraguz's widow's benefits were withheld during litigation until a final outcome. She appealed unsuccessfully in court on November 14, 2011, hoping to have Judge Clapp's ruling overturned.[7] On January 25, 2012, Araguz pleaded guilty to stealing a Rolex watch from a woman and was sentenced to 50 days in jail.[8]\nIn February 2014, the 13th Texas Court of Appeals ruled that Araguz would get another chance to litigate the case in a state district courtroom.[9] Specifically, the appellate court voided the state district court judge's summary judgment in favor of Thomas Araguz's parents and ordered the case returned to the original courtroom for further litigation.[9]\nIn 2015, a state appeals court ruling by the 13th Texas Court of Appeals sent the case of Araguz back to the Wharton County judge who originally voided the marriage because Texas did not recognize same-sex marriage.[10] Later in 2015, a state district judge in Texas ruled that Araguz was legally married to Thomas Araguz at the time of his death in 2010.[11]\n\nLater life and death[edit]\nNikki remained active in the fight for same-sex marriage until her death, aged 44, at home in Humble, Texas on November 6, 2019.[12] Her husband William Loyd announced her death.[1] According to the medical examiner, she died of an accidental drug overdose.[13] Her memorial was attended by hundreds of people and featured displays of some of her intricate clothing.[14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Nikki Araguz.\n\n\n\n^ a b Nash, Tammye (Nov 7, 2019).

She was the first transgender person to be admitted to an engineering college in the state of Tamil Nadu. As of 2014, she discontinued her studies at Sri Krishna College of Engineering. She lives in the Thoothukudi district,[1] Tamil Nadu.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Professional life\n3 Activism\n4 Tharika Banu\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBanu was born and raised in Tuticorin district, Tamil Nadu.[2] A Dalit, she says that from early in her schooldays she was not allowed to attend the regular hours of 9.30 am to 4 pm.[3]\nShe was told that in order to attend school she had to agree to come in to school at 10 am, after all the other students were in and settled, and leave at 3.30 pm before others finished.[citation needed] Other students were told that they would be punished if they interacted with her. This kind of untouchability, based on both her caste and gender identity, caused her to attempt suicide and give up on the idea of finishing school.[4] Banu's family rejected her in 2008 when she told them of her gender identity.[5]\nDespite financial difficulties and discrimination from classmates and teachers, Banu undertook a Diploma in Computer Engineering.[6][4]\nShe was the first transgender person to be admitted to an engineering college in the state of Tamil Nadu.[7] Banu struggled financially to remain in college, in part because she was not receiving any support from her family at the time. Responding to a call for help, a local businessman launched an online campaign raising funds for her to complete the course.[8] Her adopted daughter Tharika Banu is also first to attend secondary education as a transgender person in India.[9]\n\nProfessional life[edit]\nAfter completing her Diploma with honours (95%), Banu was selected to work for a software firm when she had excelled at a campus interview. She worked as a programmer until she quit due to alleged discrimination.[6]\nShe filed a Right to Information (RTI) to find out if Anna University accepted transgender students. On finding out that they did not, she applied against their rules anyway and was given admission to a private affiliated college, Sri Krishna College of Engineering.[7]\n\nActivism[edit]\nBanu believes that ultimately Reservation, dedicated places for members of different groups, is key to the uplift of transgender people. \"No amount of temporary governmental and non-governmental schemes can have the transgenerational impact that reservations can have. Reservations are the only way,\" she says.[10] She has been advocating for Dalit and transgender rights, demanding along with other transgender people for reservation based on gender identity as well as caste.[11][12][13]\nBanu insists that the intersectionality of these oppressions matter. She believes that Dalits can be transphobic and that the transgender community replicates structures of caste privilege. She says that upper-caste transgender people bring Brahminism into transgender cultural, community and organizing spaces. Despite being pressed, upper-caste transgender women dominate all the positions of leadership, call the shots and define the needs for the whole community.\"[10] Denying caste in the transgender community is like \"hiding a whole pumpkin in a plate of rice,\" she says.[10]\nBanu was active in voicing concerns and questioning the death of a fellow trans woman named Tara (Thara), who burned to death in Chennai.[14][15]\n\nTharika Banu[edit]\nTharika Banu is the first registered transgender person[16][17] to complete her secondary education in Tamil Nadu.[18][19][20] She was denied admission into college but her adoptive mother and transgender activist filed a case in Madras High Court to fight for her.[21][22]\nShe studied until Class 11 in a government school there. Her parents refused to accept her when they came to know that she was a transgender woman. After that, the bullying she fell victim to in school became unbearable.[23] In 2013, Tharika, ran away from her home in the Thoothukudi district, where she did not feel accepted or comfortable. She arrived in Chennai, where she was legally adopted by transgender activist Grace Banu.[24] Grace helped her to get an official identification, name change and a sex reassignment surgery and made it possible for Tharika to finish her education.[citation needed]\n\nSee also[edit]\nTransgender rights in Tamil Nadu\nLGBT rights in India\nRights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014, India\nLiving Smile Vidya, transgender activist in India\nLaxmi Narayan Tripathi, transgender activist in India\nList of Dalits\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kumar, S.

In 2007, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences chose Bunten as the 10th inductee into its Hall of Fame.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 M.U.L.E\n4 The Seven Cities of Gold\n5 Ozark Softscape\n6 Personal life\n7 Games\n8 Recognition\n9 See also\n10 References\n11 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBunten was born in St. Louis, Missouri and moved to Little Rock, Arkansas as a junior in high school.[2] She was the oldest of six siblings. While growing up in Little Rock, Bunten's family didn't always have enough money to make ends meet, so Bunten took a job at a pharmacy. She also held a leadership role with the Boy Scouts.[2]\nAccording to Bunten, one of her fondest childhood memories involved playing games with her family. She was quoted saying, \u201cWhen I was a kid, the only times my family spent together that weren\u2019t totally dysfunctional were when we were playing games. Consequently, I believe games are a wonderful way to socialize.\u201d[2]\nWhile attending the University of Arkansas, she opened up her own bike shop called Highroller Cyclerie.[2] Bunten acquired a degree in industrial engineering in 1974 and started programming text-based video games as a hobby. After she graduated from college, she was employed by the National Science Foundation, where she created urban models before starting a job at a video game company.[2]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 1978, Bunten sold a real-time auction game for the Apple II titled Wheeler Dealers to a Canadian software company, Speakeasy Software. This early multiplayer game required a custom controller, raising its price to USD$35 in an era of $15 games sold in plastic bags. It sold only 50 copies.[5]\nAfter producing three titles for SSI, Bunten, who by then had founded a software company called Ozark Softscape, caught the attention of Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. M.U.L.E. was Bunten's first game for EA, originally published for the Atari 8-bit family because the Atari 800 had four controller ports. Bunten later ported it to the Commodore 64. While its sales - 30,000 units - were not high, the game developed a cult following and was widely pirated. The game setting was inspired by the novel Time Enough for Love by Robert A. Heinlein.[5]\nAlong with the success of M.U.L.E., Berry also had close ties with the games Robot Rascals, Heart of Africa, and Cartels & Cutthroat$.  Throughout her career, she was involved in the creation of 12 games, 10 of which revolved around multiplayer compatibility. The only two which didn't have a multiplayer focus were Seven Cities of Gold and Heart of Africa.[2]\nBunten wanted to follow up M.U.L.E. with a game that would have been similar to the later game Civilization, but after fellow Ozark Softscape partners balked at the idea, Bunten followed with The Seven Cities of Gold, which proved popular because of its simplicity. By the time the continent data were stored in the computer's memory, there was little left for fancy graphics or complex gameplay - the game had only five resources. It was a hit, selling more than 150,000 copies.\nThe follow-up game, Heart of Africa, appeared in 1985 and was followed by Robot Rascals, a combination computer/card game that had no single-player mode and sold only 9,000 copies, and 1988's Modem Wars, one of the early games played by two players over a dial-up modem. [6] Modem Wars was ahead of its time, as few people in the late 1980s had modems in their homes.[7]\nBunten departed EA for MicroProse. Allegedly, Trip Hawkins, CEO of EA, did not feel that pushing production of games onto a cartridge based system was a good idea. The shift was important to Bunten, as computer games had previously been distributed on floppy discs, and a changeover to a cartridge system would allow games to be played on Nintendo systems.[8] This was a significant factor in her decision to leave. She then developed a computer version of the board game Axis and Allies, which became 1990's Command HQ, a modem/network grand strategy wargame. Bunten's second and last game for MicroProse was 1992's Global Conquest, a 4-player network/modem war game. It was the first 4-player network game from a major publisher. Bunten was a strong advocate of multi-player online games, observing that, \"No one ever said on their deathbed, 'Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone with my computer.'\"[9]\nA port of M.U.L.E. to the Mega Drive/Genesis was cancelled after Bunten refused to put guns and bombs in the game, feeling it would alter the game too much from its original concept.[10]  In 1997, Bunten shifted focus to multiplayer games over the Internet with Warsport, a remake of Modem Wars that debuted on the MPlayer.com game network.\nLess than a year after the release of Warsport, Bunten was diagnosed with lung cancer presumably related to years of heavy smoking.[11] She died on July 3, 1998. At the time, she was working on the design of an Internet version of M.U.L.E..[5]\n\nM.U.L.E[edit]\nMain article: M.U.L.E.\nThe game's primary premise consisted of players playing with and against one another to establish total control over a planet.[12] The name of the game stands for Multiple Use Labor Element.[12] The game was originally made for the Atari 400 and Atari 800 but was later developed to be compatible with the Commodore 64, NES, and IBM pcjr.[12] The game has a maximum of four players. Players are given different options and choices, and are allowed to create their colony the way they see fit. This can be done by changing races and giving respective colonies different advantages that will impact the way the game is played and determined later on down the line.[12]\nUltimately there are two ways in which players can win the game. The first way is by having the most amount of money out of all four players, and the second way is by being able to survive the colony itself.[12] The game focuses heavily on going out and retrieving resources that can be used to benefit their character.[12] Items such as food, energy, and crystite are some of a number of in-game items that players are able to retrieve and use to better themselves.[12] In order for a player to be able to access these items, they will first have to have access to a M.U.L.E.[12] The acquisition of these items has a direct reflection on what the player will be allowed to do. For example, if a player doesn't have enough food, they will have less time during their turn.[12]\n\nThe Seven Cities of Gold[edit]\nMain article: The Seven Cities of Gold (video game)\nThe Seven Cities of Gold was originally intended to be another multiplayer game.[13] It was originally a single player format, focused heavily on having the players travel around the map and collect items to help them strengthen their colony. Once they felt as though they had a solid colony, the players could battle each other to see who could overtake who.[13] After much consideration, Ozark Software came to the conclusion that this would not be doable. Instead, they went with a formula that had the game focus solely on developing a colony.[13]\n\nOzark Softscape[edit]\nOzark Softscape was a computer game development team consisting initially of Danielle Bunten, her brother Bill Bunten, Jim Rushing, and Alan Watson. Ozark was run out of Bunten's basement.[14] The company was based out of Little Rock, Arkansas and had profound success with a few of their early titles. Ozark Softscape had a publishing deal with Electronic Arts for several of its groundbreaking games. In the early 1990s, Ozark Softscape left its partnership with Electronic Arts over a dispute to port some games to cartridge format for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It began a partnership with MicroProse to produce two more titles: Command HQ and Global Conquest. A dispute occurred over creating a follow-up to M.U.L.E. with Sega in 1993, and the company dissolved. The employees of Ozark Softscape moved to different areas of the software industry.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBunten was married three times. Bunten had three children, one daughter and two sons.[2]\nAfter a third divorce, Bunten, who had until then been living as male, transitioned to living as a woman. Bunten underwent sex reassignment surgery in November 1992 and afterward kept a lower profile in the games industry. Bunten later regretted having surgery, finding that for her, the drawbacks of surgical transition outweighed the benefits, and wishing she had considered alternative approaches.[15] She joked that the surgery was to improve the video game industry's male/female ratio and aesthetics,[16] but advised others considering a sex change not to proceed unless there was no alternative and warned them of the cost, saying \"Being my 'real self' could have included having a penis and including more femininity in whatever forms made sense. I didn't know that until too late and now I have to make the best of the life I've stumbled into. I just wish I would have tried more options before I jumped off the precipice.\"[15]\nAfter her transition in fall 1992, Bunten stayed out of the video game spotlight, mostly keeping to herself. She felt as though that after transitioning she was not as good at video game development as she had previously been, stating \"So, I'm a little more than three years into my new life role as Ms. Danielle Berry, and her career looks to be somewhat different from old Mr. Dan Bunten's. For one thing, I'm not as good a programmer as he was.\"[2]\nOn July 3, 1998, Berry died of lung cancer.[17]\n\nGames[edit]\nWheeler Dealers (1978)\nCartels & Cutthroats (1981)\nComputer Quarterback (1981)\nCytron Masters (1982)\nM.U.L.E.

On May 7, 1998, less than two months before her death, Berry was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Computer Game Developers Association.[2]\nIn 2000, Will Wright dedicated his blockbuster hit The Sims to Bunten's memory. In 2007, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences chose Bunten to be inducted into its Hall of Fame.[4] Sid Meier, the mastermind behind the video game series Civilization, inducted her at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas.\nBunten was a true pioneer for the video game industry, especially its multiplayer aspect of it. She is regarded by many as one of the best designers to ever grace the video game industry. Her success has even led people to make the claim that the work she did with games like M.U.L.E and Seven Cities of Gold was the inspiration behind highly successful modern multiplayer games like World of Warcraft.[7]\nBunten was known as someone who was very easy to talk to. If someone recognized her in public, she would be more than delighted to have a conversation with them.[8]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nBiography portal\nVideo games portal\nDona Bailey\nJamie Fenton\nLucy Gilbert\nPatricia Goodson\nRebecca Heineman\nAmy Hennig\nBrenda Laurel\nSuki Lee\nChris Maddox\nCathryn Mataga\nCarla Meninsky\nLaura Nikolich\nCarol Shaw\nCarol Ryan Thomas\nJoyce Weisbecker\nAnne Westfall\nList of programmers\nList of women in the video game industry\nWomen and video games\nWomen in computing\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"D.I.C.E Special Awards\".

Studious, she followed her dream and became an attorney. Su\u00e1rez went to primary and secondary school in Salinas before entering university in 2004. After six years of study, and a legal transition to allow her to graduate with her proper gender, Su\u00e1rez earned her doctorate.[2] She was the first (and only) trans-woman to become a lawyer in Uruguay[1][3] graduating in 2010 from the University of the Republic as the first transgender person to complete university studies in the country.[4][5] In 2014, she also became the first transgender person elected to the Uruguayan legislature.[1][6]\nSu\u00e1rez is a member of, and the legal adviser to, the organization \"Ovejas Negras\" (Black Sheep), an LGBT rights organization. She joined in 2010, shortly after the death of her mother. Working was cathartic for dealing with her grief and she immediately[1] set out to draft the equal marriage proposal,[6] which was presented to Congress in 2011. The bill initially passed the Senate in 2012 and after review by the judicial committee received final approval in 2013.[7]\nSu\u00e1rez is also a body-image activist. Constantly asked about her obesity, she recognizes that women must follow a rigid aesthetic. She says it is sometimes even more of a struggle for transgender individuals, as multiple minorities. The stereotype of young, \"modelish,\" and eternally beautiful in Su\u00e1rez's view is absurd and oppressive for all women.[1][2]\nSuarez's belief is that prejudices must be addressed by legal standards which are substantive and accompanied by public debate.  She has written a book to address implementation of human rights for those who have difficulties because of their orientation or gender identity.[1]\nSuarez was sworn into the Uruguayan senate in October 2017, becoming the first transgender senator in the nation's history. In December 2017, Suarez resigned her seat in the senate after she was found guilty in a criminal investigation of forging legal documents while working as an attorney.\n\nSelected works[edit]\nHacia una Igualdad Sustantiva  Mujer y Salud en Uruguay (2012) (ISBN\u00a0978-9974-8303-1-8)[8]\nSee also[edit]\nList of transgender people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f Formoso, Sof\u00eda (9 February 2015). \"Michelle Su\u00e1rez: La primera abogada trans de Uruguay\" (in Spanish).

Reared in the remote suburbs of Hagerstown, Maryland, Bond's early role models appeared via the stereo and the television set.  From early on, Bond longed \"to sing, be amusing, and wear fabulous outfits\" like Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, and Cher.[7]  The young Bond idolized \"more icy people\" like Joan Didion, Patti Smith, Marianne Faithfull, Vivien Leigh, and Grace Kelly,[8] keeping scrapbooks of Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave.[9] Listening to the family's eight-track tapes in the back seat of a white, Buick Skylark on road trips, Bond preferred a recording of Billy Vaughn and their orchestra because \"it sounded like a movie soundtrack\" for an imaginary film in which Bond, wearing high heels, played the leading role.[10]  Bond recalls falling in love with an album for the first time at the age of four after hearing Wildflowers by Judy Collins,[11] and soon became obsessed with Karen Carpenter.\nThough assigned male at birth, Bond (born Stanley Huffman Bond III but known as Chip) never identified as such. As a child Bond preferred lipstick and Barbies to masculine-coded items and also entered into relationships with boys.[12]  Consequently, Bond grew up feeling \"invisible\", resenting the younger sister who \"got everything I wanted.\"[13] As \"a trans kid in a small town,\" Bond recalls feeling that \"I wasn't being accepted for who I was, but at the time I didn't even have the words to express who I was.\"[14]  Meanwhile, Bond was taking voice lessons and singing in church and in the local community theater, appearing in shows like Brigadoon, Kiss Me, Kate, and The Sound of Music, and channeling comedian Gilda Radner for schoolmates.  Within a personal netherworld of ambiguous gender and sexuality, Bond had begun to construct an identity as a performer.\nBond studied theater at Adelphi University on Long Island from 1981 to 1985.[15] The newly minted freshman saw Simon and Garfunkel in concert in Central Park, but it was visiting Carnegie Hall for the first time to see Judy Collins that invoked the realization that \"I had escaped my hometown and was finally beginning to live the life I'd dreamed of.\"[16] Bond went to London to study theater in the summer of 1984, befriending fellow student Victoria Leacock, daughter of the filmmaker, Richard Leacock. Leacock knew Jenny Lumet, a granddaughter of Lena Horne, and managed to get Bond backstage to meet Horne, who appeared \"icy, intimidating, beautiful and talented \u2013 everything I hoped to be one day.\"[16] Bond later sported a pair of Horne earrings as a souvenir.  Meanwhile, Adelphi advised Bond to become more \"butch\" to earn a living in soap operas.\n\nEarly career[edit]\nAfter graduation, Bond moved into the city to work briefly at Details magazine with Lumet. Returning to Maryland, Bond found roles in regional dinner theaters, often doubling as a server. This work led to a brief stint as assistant to the maitre d' of the Roof Terrace Restaurant in the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where Bond witnessed a memorable performance by Ella Fitzgerald.  Bond took the job partly to find out \"whether or not I could, if I had to, make a living in the 'straight' world\" as a \"normal, middle-class, semi-closeted gay...\"[17] According to Bond, this experiment provided the confidence to \"plunge into my life as a gender non-conforming queer in San Francisco a year later believing that I could \u2013 in case of emergency \u2013 break the glass ceiling by returning to my closeted white male privilege again one day if need be.\"[17] Bond moved to San Francisco in 1988.\nBond remembers this as a period of significant personal growth, both creative and political.  It was here that Bond turned androgyny into a professional asset, developing an identity as a queer performer and activist.  The first steps on this journey led through the Castro District, the vibrant, queer neighborhood mostly concentrated on Castro Street between Market and 19th in San Francisco.  Bond started out broke, clerking in a gay bookstore[9] to buy the coffee at Cafe Flore on Market and Noe, a bohemian salon that became a \"spiritual home.\"[18] Seated at the \"Queen's Table\" in the corner, Bond absorbed a variety of perspectives from all corners of the LGBT community, attending Gay Pride for the first time in 1989.[19]  Participation in Queer Nation and ACT UP, advocacy groups combatting HIV/AIDS, anti-gay violence, and media prejudice, gave Bond \"a voice and a sort of grounding in politics\" that were new.[20]  At some point, Bond adopted the stage name of Justin, later explaining that there were few fates worse than becoming an old, gay man named Chip.[18]\nA turning point occurred when Kate Bornstein cast Bond in her new play, Hidden: A Gender, using the life of the French, intersex person Herculine Barbin as an autobiographical device.  Bond \"was not sure he could really pull off playing a girl,\" according to Bornstein, and feared the censure of \"his gay male friends.\"[21] In fact, the experience unleashed a reservoir of creative energy.  With the assistance of a twenty-something Berkeley drop-out named Kenny Mellman, Bond created the award-nominated lounge act Dixie McCall's Patterns for Living around the persona of actress and singer Julie London.[22] The duo played a number of gigs, both in and out of character; three years after attending Pride for the first time, Bond was hosting the show at the end of the parade.[23] In 1993, Bond hosted the first San Francisco Drag King Contest at the DNA Lounge with Elvis Herselvis.[24] In 1994, Bond appeared on film for the first time, as Amphetamine in John Moritsugu's Mod Fuck Explosion, and again the following year in Fanci's Persuasion.\n\nThe Trans-Atlantic Cabaret Messiah[edit]\nKiki and Herb: 1993\u20132007[edit]\n\nKiki and Herb met in the Eerie Childrens Institute in Western Pennsylvania in 1934. By the time they were in their late teens they were playing professionally on the Burlesque Circuit where Kiki, who had just given birth to her first child \u2013 a bastard named Bradford \u2013 was billed as \"The Completely Insane Miss Kiki DuRane\". In 1957 Kiki and Herb released their first LP \"The Hazy Days of Kiki\" to universal indifference.\n\u2014 Part of the fictional biography for Kiki and Herb.[25]\n\n\nBond is best known for originating the role of washed-up lounge singer Kiki DuRane, \"an alcoholic battle-axe with a throat full of razor-blades.\"[26] Kiki's equally-damaged accompanist Herb, played by pianist Kenny Mellman, made up the other half of the duo, billed as Kiki and Herb.[27] Critics lauded both the performance and the edgy, eclectic repertoire.  Described in one place as \"tragically hip,\"[28] the inspiration arose \"out of my own trauma regarding AIDS and so many people dying,\"[29]  according to Bond.  \"All our friends were dying of AIDS, and it was a way to get out all our rage,\" said Mellman.[21]\nBond moved to New York City in 1994, in the midst of crackdown on queer clubs by then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.  A quote from Bond relates that \"I worked in many bars where the police would just come and shut us down and throw us all out on the street at two or three in the morning.\"[23] Nevertheless, the act continued to evolve, generating a mythical backstory as the entertainers became \"fixtures at downtown New York venues like Flamingo East, P.S. 122, and Fez.\"[30]  Journalist John Russell saw in Kiki \"an icon to rival Hedwig.\"[31]   The New York Times has dubbed Kiki \"the town's most endearingly unhinged chanteuse,\"[32] comparing Bond favorably to more conventional performers for whom \"the point is never the prettiness of the voice.\"[33]  Bond has said that \"I think that the reason people liked Kiki so much is that she had just about everything wrong with her.\"[34]\nKiki and Herb met with more critical acclaim with each successive appearance and developed a cult following.  They received their first New York Times review for Have Another, (1999),[35] a show that earned a GLAAD media award the following year.[36]  They performed extensively, namely in London's Soho Theatre and Queen Elizabeth Hall and New York's The Knitting Factory and Carnegie Hall, as well as a host of other venues worldwide. Their numerous collaborators included Debbie Harry of Blondie, comedian Sandra Bernhard, and Antony of Antony and the Johnsons.  Their recordings included the Christmas album, Do You Hear What We Hear? (2000), and Kiki and Herb Will Die for You: Live at Carnegie Hall (2005).  In 2004, Bond and Mellman did a cameo in the Sony Pictures release Imaginary Heroes, with script by Dan Harris.[37]  Appearing alongside Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, and Emile Hirsch, the duo reprised the Melanie Safka composition Tonight's the Kind of Night from Do You Hear What We Hear?   Their stage act was captured on video in Kiki and Herb Live at the Knitting Factory (2007).  They toured twice in the U.S., including the 2007  'Year of Magical Drinking Tour.'[38]\nThe duo traveled repeatedly to London, where Bond continued to work on an MA in scenography at Central St. Martin's College of Art and Design when not performing.  London shows included Where Are We Now?, Kiki & Herb: There's a Stranger in the Manger, and Kiki & Herb Mount The President, the latter performed aboard HMS\u00a0President in the River Thames.  Bond had a Top 20 Single on the UK alternative chart and was named one of England's fifty funniest people by Time Out London.[39]  The mockumentaries entitled Kiki and Herb on the Rocks (2005) and Kiki and Herb Reloaded (2005) followed the pair to London and around the UK, respectively, featuring the composer Philip Glass, among others.\nTheir show Kiki & Herb: Alive on Broadway ran for five weeks in 2006, and was nominated for a 2007 Tony for Special Theatrical Event.[40] One critic noted that onstage they are \"Alive with a capital A, with all the human vitality and fallibility that that implies.\"[41] A poster on tribe.net reported hearing them mentioned on an episode of Will and Grace early in 2006, noting that \"now they have crossed over.\"[42] Ironically, Bond was by then moving away from the stage act after more than a decade, having almost come to resent the \"very intrusive\" presence of Kiki and the demands associated with playing this \"very dark\" role.  \"I knew that if I kept doing Kiki I wouldn't have the energy to focus on what I really wanted to do,\" Bond explains, \"which was write and perform as myself.\"[31]  \"I created an invulnerable character in Kiki,\" Bond reflected elsewhere, \"and as soon as I got rid of the character, there were a lot of bad habits that sort of fell away. I realized that I have to allow myself to be more vulnerable, more honest, if I'm going to be a performer.\"[43] Locked into a stage act consisting of one other person, it appears that Bond had also begun to feel socially constrained.\nAfter closing on Broadway, Bond took a brief hiatus in London to get away from Kiki, before returning later that year in preparation for the final, American tour.[44] This was followed by a return to Carnegie Hall for a one-night show on December 12, 2007, billed as Kiki and Herb: The Second Coming \u2013 A Christmas Concert.[45]  The show played again at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London.  In spite of their retirement, Kiki and Herb appeared on a list of the top 40 favorite New Yorkers in Time Out New York in 2008.[46] In a 2011 interview with The Guardian, Bond quipped that Kiki DuRane, if not actually deceased, was at least \"in a nursing home in New Jersey.\"[29]\n\nSolo career: 1993\u2013present[edit]\nBond's solo career as a singer, emcee, cabaret artist, and actor, grew up alongside Kiki and Herb, and ultimately outlived them.  Prior to retiring Kiki in 2008, Bond already was touring nationally and abroad, appearing in film, and recording under the name of Justin Bond.  Post-Kiki, Bond continued to move freely between San Francisco and New York, frequently traveling to London and less frequently, to Australia.  The period that followed differed largely in terms of the originality and variety of material as Bond experimented with new endeavors.\nBond's first album came about unexpectedly, as the result of an improvised concert with experimental, electronic sound artist Bob Ostertag and a Japanese turntablist from the Tokyo noise underground, Otomo Yoshihide, at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall in 1997. Bond already appeared on two tracks (\"Not Your Girl\" and \"The Man In The Blue Slip\") on Ostertag's 1995 album, \"Fear No Love\", sharing co-lead vocals duties with Mike Patton. Other guests on the record were Fred Frith and Lynn Breedlove. At the behest of the record label Asphodel, an album was recorded in this location and in studio at Toast, with additional tracks and musicians added later.  Since Otomo spoke little English and could not understand what Bond was saying, he watched the recording engineer through the glass and \"when I see he laugh, I play something funny.\"[47] The album was ultimately released under the Seeland label in 1999 as PantyChrist, with a European, promotional tour.  Although it failed commercially, Ostertag viewed it from an artistic standpoint as \"one of my most successful projects.\"[48]\nThe EP and the two albums that followed likewise appear to have arisen rather spontaneously, differing largely in terms of the original material they contained as a result of Bond's decision to venture into songwriting.  Wanting to get something out quickly and not sure how to do it, Bond released a five track EP Pink Slip in June 2009 featuring four original songs (\"The New Depression,\" \"May Queen,\" \"The Puppet Song,\" \"Michael in Blue\") and a cover of Radiohead's \"Arpeggi/Weird Fishes\".  Pink Slip was recorded at Le Poisson Rouge and Bond hoped income from the EP would help fund the recording of an album.[31] Both of the albums were self-financed, and both were the result of a collaboration with pianist/producer Thomas Bartlett of the band Doveman.[49] The first, Dendrophile (2011), contained a mix of original compositions and covers modeled on a type of \"early-'70s folk-pop variety album\"[49] in the spirit of Judy Collins, featuring a duet with English singer-songwriter Beth Orton.  The title apparently references the creative energy arising from self-acceptance, and is \"all about honoring your nature, and nature itself.\"[50] Bond used Kickstarter to finance the release of a second album, Silver Wells, in 2012.  The album was conceived as an homage to the 1970 Joan Didion novel, Play it as it Lays, which fortified Bond against the isolation that Bond experienced as a child.  The album features covers of songs made famous by Ronee Blakley, Kate Bush, Leonard Cohen, Tracy Chapman, Joni Mitchell, Mark Eitzel, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, among others, and has been described as \"intimate\" and \"confessional\" in tone.[51]  Bond put the songs together as a set list for a show, only later deciding to go into the studio with Bartlett.[50]\nIn 2012, Bond toured nationally with lesbian-feminist, spoken-word collective Sister Spit. promoting the new album.[50] Later that year, Bond opened the new holiday show, Snow Angel, with Amber Martin on vocals, NathAnn Carrera on guitar, and Brett Every on piano.  Depending on the outcome of the presidential election, the name was intended to refer either to \"the whimsical joy of making fun shapes in the snow,\" or \"the imprint you would leave in the snow if you were being raped.\"[52]\nIn June 2006, Bond appeared with David Hoyle in a one-off entitled When David Met Justin at London's Bush Hall.[53] Performing with the House of Whimsy Players at The Kitchen in October, Bond staged Re:Galli Blond (A Sissy Fix), \"a self-penned musical spectacle of transgender oppression and uplift.\"[54] Bond also appeared in Paul Festa's Apparition of the Eternal Church (2006).[55]\nBond has hosted the Weimer New York variety show since its inception in 2007.[56][57] Justin Bond is Close To You reinterpreted Karen Carpenter's album Close To You as part of Joe's Pub in the Park in Central Park in 2007, later moving to Australia's Sydney Opera House.\nIn 2008, the GLAAD-nominated show Lustre premiered at PS122 in the East Village to rave reviews before touring the UK with stops in London and Manchester as part of the It's Queer Up North Arts Festival.  In December 2008, Bond appeared at London's Southbank Centre as Sinderella, in the original musical written by Martyn Jacques of the British cult trio Tiger Lillies.  Bond was credited in the band's album of the same name.[58]  Bond has appeared with Carol Channing, Tilda Swinton, and Chocolate Genius, Inc., among others.\nJustin Bond: Christmas Spells opened in December 2010 at Abrons Arts Center on Grand Street in Manhattan's Lower East Side.  The two-part show included a trademark cabaret performance of holiday tunes, showcasing an original composition, Could Baby Jesus in His Manger Foresee the Hate Sprung From That Night?  This was followed by a theatrical adaptation of a short story by a Bond pal, the artist and gender-theorist Kate Bornstein. Dixie Belle: The Further Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was conceived as a holiday epistle informing Tom Sawyer of the author's gender-bending adventures in a New Orleans bordello after the Civil War.  The letter was read by Bond and enacted by the drag troupe Pixie Harlots. In December 2015 an EP also called Christmas Spells  was released including 3 songs (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Remember (Christmas) and Christmas Spells).[59]\n\n\nAs for Vivian, that's my self-given middle name. Justin is a very male-identified name, and I wanted something that would balance it. I had an uncle named Vivian Francis. He was a wonderful person, but he changed his name to Victor. He didn't like being Vivian. But it's fine with me.\n\u2014 Justin Vivian Bond, 2010.[54]\n\n\nBond starred as Warhol Superstar Jackie Curtis in Jukebox Jackie as part of the 50th anniversary season of La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club between May and June 2012.  \"I've always been really interested in Jackie, Holly Woodlawn, and Candy Darling,\" Bond recounted in an interview at the time, \"because they, along with Renee Richards and Christine Jorgensen, were the first famous trans people. When I was young, they were really the only trans people to which I had been exposed.\"[50] According to Bond, the project originated as a revival of one of Jackie's \"crazy, amphetamine-fueled\" plays, but Bond (and director Scott Wittman) \"couldn't really make sense of them\" and turned to reportage instead. \"I always liked Jackie,\" Bond said, \"because Jackie wasn't willing to say, 'I am a woman trapped in a man's body,' she'd say, 'I'm trans, I'm not a man. I'm not a woman. I'm Jackie.' Which, by the way, was the last line of the show.\"[50]\nBond's new show, Mx America, was slated to open in Australia in February 2013.[60]\nBeginning in January 2014, Bond appeared alongside Stephen Spinella in the Classic Stage Company production of the Bertolt Brecht play, A Man's A Man (Man Equals Man), with new music by Duncan Sheik.  The show ran Off-Broadway at the Company's theater on 13th Street in Manhattan's East Village, with Bond playing the part of Leokadia Begbick, a role originated by Brecht's wife, Helene Weigel.[61] Bond left the show early to go abroad, premiering sold-out shows of Love is Crazy in Paris and New York.  More performances are scheduled for London in February 2015.\nIn December 2014, Bond's wide range and appeal, as well as the personal struggles that have informed all of Bond's work, were once more on display in Star of Light! An Evening of Bi-Polar Witchy Wonder, which opened at Joe's Pub on Lafayette near Manhattan's Astor Place.  One critic found in it \"a surprisingly upbeat holiday show full of sad stories and songs\" both eclectic and smartly executed, noting \"a psychedelic intensity to Bond's voice reminiscent of Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane.\"[62] Backups included Matt Ray on piano, Claudia Chopek on violin, and NathAnn Carrera on guitar.\n\nCollaborators[edit]\nThriving on collaboration, Bond used the platform provided by Kiki and Herb to forge working relationships with a number of rising stars among the downtown demimonde, including filmmaker John Cameron Mitchell, performer Jake Shears, and musician Rufus Wainwright.\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell[edit]\nIn 2006, Bond appeared in the film Shortbus, as part of cast that included Sook-Yin Lee, PJ DeBoy, and Paul Dawson.[29] In the movie, directed by fellow Radical Faerie John Cameron Mitchell, Bond played the mistress of ceremonies at the eponymous avant-garde salon Shortbus, singing the Scott Matthew number, \"In the End,\" to the music of the Hungry March Band.  One journalist commented that this expressed \"in just one scene that heightened sense of simultaneous hope and despair in post\u20139/11 downtown New York City.\"[15] Bond referred to the film as a \"gorgeous little time capsule.\"[63]\nWriting for The New York Times, Frank Bruni noted that Mitchell had relied heavily on friends in casting the film, and that Bond was no exception.  Bond and Mitchell had been frequenting the same Greenwich Village hangouts for about ten years by that time, including the Cow Girl Hall of Fame on Hudson, where Bond had been perfecting the role of Kiki.  Bruni observes that \"on top of all of the other odd aspects of its evolution, \"Shortbus\" represented a reunion and collaboration of fringe artists [like Bond] moving closer to the mainstream.\"[64]  \"Of all the people doing creative things in the queer community,\" wrote Bond's friend and colleague, the experimental sound artist Bob Ostertag, \"Justin Bond had a particular dazzle.\"  Now, Ostertag reflected, \"Justin is a star.\"[65]\n\nJake Shears[edit]\nJake Shears, lead singer of Scissor Sisters, has cited the Kiki and Herb Christmas Show as inspiration. Bond and Shears became friends, with the Scissor Sisters fronting for Kiki and Herb at The Knitting Factory, and with Bond later returning the favor after the band's eponymous debut album went platinum in the United Kingdom in 2004.[15] Bond appeared in the 2017 Music Box Theatre performance of the Tales of the City musical, with score by Shears.[66]\n\nRufus Wainwright[edit]\nThe musician Rufus Wainwright, son of Canadian folk singer Kate McGarrigle, was another rising star from the downtown club scene who befriended Bond at this time.  In 2008, Bond participated in a Christmas show at the Knitting Factory that included Rufus Wainwright, members of Wainwright's family, Grammy Award-winner Emmylou Harris, Lou Reed, Velvet Underground, and performance artist Laurie Anderson.  Revelation Films released the concert DVD in November 2009 under the title A Not So Silent Night (Kate & Anna McGarrigle/Rufus & Martha Wainwright).[67] Bond has appeared in concert with Rufus Wainwright's sister, Martha Wainwright, whom Bond calls a \"Taurean sister.\"  In 2011, Bond stated that \"we are going to celebrate our birthdays together this year.\"[68] In May of that year, Bond appeared with various artists in \"A Celebration of Kate McGarrigle,\" at New York City's Town Hall, to commemorate the passing of the Wainwrights' mother, who had succumbed to cancer the previous year.  A DVD was released in 2013.  In August 2012, Bond officiated at Rufus Wainwright's Long Island wedding.[69]\n\nActivism[edit]\nIdentifying as a queer performer infused Bond's art with an activist ethos from the beginning.  In addition, Bond has labored tirelessly in support of queer causes and organizations and has been numbered \"amongst New York City's most beloved performers . . . remarkable for their generosity of spirit...\"[70] Bond participated in the original Gay Shame event in New York in 1998, performing as Kiki and Herb and recorded in the Scott Berry documentary, Gay Shame '98.  On September 25, 2012, Bond hosted a special edition of Weimar as a fundraiser for the reelection of U.S. President, Barack Obama.  In November, Bond announced a performance to benefit the Ali Forney Center for LGBT youth in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.[71]  Ahead of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Bond appeared in a video by Brooklyn-based Potpourri of Pearls, protesting Russian mistreatment of LGBT persons.[72]\n\nOther projects[edit]\nIn July 2009 Bond made an appearance on the Logo TV comedy series Jeffery & Cole Casserole, playing a Catholic nun who serves as the principal of the show's all-girl Catholic school.[citation needed]\n2011 saw the opening of The Fall of the House of Whimsy exhibition at Participant, Inc., an alternative, Manhattan gallery that hosted an installation of \"artifacts, media, and ephemera\" from Bond's nearby loft (then slated for demolition) including original Bond photographs and watercolors.  The \"spectral\" photographs reflected mostly unoccupied interiors of the loft, while the paintings, portraits and self-portraits, have been described as \"light, aerie images,\" whose subjects fade in and out.[73]  Also on display was a music video of the Bond composition, American Wedding.[74]\nIn 2012, Bond announced the creation of a signature fragrance by Ralf Schwieger, a \"trans-scent\" for all genders called The Afternoon of a Faun after the French poem and modernist ballet of the same name, and issued under the French label Etat libre d'Orange.[75] It was launched in February 2013, at Manhattan's Museum of Arts and Design on Columbus Circle.\nBond received a 2012 Lambda Literary Award for the memoir, Tango: My Childhood Backwards and in High Heels.  Also in 2012, powerHouse Books released Susie Says, a picture book combining Gina Garan photos of the 1970s fashion doll, Susie Sad Eyes, with bon mots from Bond's Twitter account.[76]\nIn the summer of 2014, Bond curated and emceed a cabaret season at the Spiegeltent at the Bard SummerScape Festival in the Hudson Valley, NY.  Bond is set to reprise this emcee role in summer 2015, with guests including Alan Cumming, Suzanne Vega, Martha Wainwright, Stephen Merritt, and Lea Delaria.[77]\nDuring the 2020 pandemic quarantine Bond performed weekly House of Whimsy livestream concerts as Auntie Glam.[78]\nIn July 2020 Bond was announced as part of the cast of Audible's adaptation of Neil Gaiman's The Sandman series, playing the role of Desire of the Endless.[79]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\"In contrast with the furious, blowsy, manic DuRane,\" wrote Maria Bustillos of Out Magazine, \"Bond is gentle, disciplined, observant, and beautifully mannered; a student of the theater, a serious and subtle conversationalist and raconteur.\"[80]\nBond has decided to clarify an identity as a trans-person, explaining that \"for me to claim to be either a man or a woman, feels like a lie. My identity falls somewhere in the middle and is constantly shifting.\"[81] Bond undergoes hormone treatment to appear more feminine,[6] and reported feeling great as a result, noting that \"I like the way my body looks. Emotionally, it's evened me out.\"[29] Eschewing gender reassignment surgery, Bond explained that \"I like my penis, and I am keeping it, but I am creating a transbody\u2014a physical record on my body and a medical record that I am a transgendered person.\"[15] In 2011, Bond also adopted the middle name of 'Vivian', subsequently identifying as \"Justin Vivian Bond\" instead of \"Justin Bond\".[6][54]\nIn concert at the end of 2014, Bond disclosed having received an invitation to return home for Thanksgiving, conditional upon leaving behind \"that fake woman.\"  Acknowledging that \"a lot of trans-kids get kicked out of their homes,\" Bond mused \"I didn't until I was 51.

Boylan graduated from Wesleyan University in 1980, then completed graduate work in English at Johns Hopkins University.[citation needed]\n\nCareer[edit]\nBoylan was on the faculty of Colby College from 1988 to 2014.[3][4] In 2000, she was named \"Professor of the Year\" at Colby College.[5] Starting in 2001 after her male-to-female transition, she began publishing under the name Jennifer Boylan.[6] She moved to Barnard in 2014, where she is both Professor of English and Anna Quindlen Writer-in-Residence.[7]\nBoylan has written thirteen books, including novels, collections of short stories, and her autobiography. She has also contributed to the op-ed section of The New York Times.[3] Her 2003 autobiography, She's Not There: A Life in Two Genders was the first book published by an openly transgender American to become a bestseller.[3] Her memoir, Good Boy: My Life in Seven Dogs was published on April 21, 2020 with Celadon Books.[8]\nIn 2013, Boylan was chosen as the first openly transgender co-chair of GLAAD's National Board of Directors.[9] Boylan also serves on the Policy Advisory Board of Gender Rights Maryland[10] and the Board of Trustees of the Kinsey Institute for Research on Sex, Gender, and Reproduction.\n\nPublic life[edit]\nBoylan has spoken on numerous college campuses, including Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Columbia, and Barnard.[11] Boylan has made appearances via a variety of media outlets to discuss her life, books, and activism. She has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live, The Today Show, 48 Hours, and NPR.[3] She made an appearance on 20/20 on April 24, 2015 in support of celebrity Caitlyn Jenner revealing she is a trans person and regularly appeared on screen and as a consultant on Jenner's reality show I Am Cait.[12]\nBased on the text of the appeal, she signed A Letter on Justice and Open Debate which appeared on Harper's Magazine website on 7 July 2020, including many high-profile names, some with controversial positions on human sexuality within the trans community, such as J. K. Rowling. On discovering the names of the other signatories post-publication, Boylan retracted her signature, whereas the transgender LGBT activist Deirdre McCloskey remains on the list.[13]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBoylan is a trans woman. She has two children, Zaira and Sean, with Deirdre Boylan, whom she married in 1988.[14] Boylan began transitioning in 2000,[15] beginning with therapy, feminine clothing, and female hormone supplements.[16] While undergoing sexual reassignment surgery, Boylan was convinced that her marriage to Deirdre would end.[17] Today, the couple is still married and lives in New York City and Belgrade Lakes, Maine.[11] Nine years after she began her transition, Boylan published an article for The New York Times stating that \"my spouse and I love each other, and that our legal union has been a good thing \u2013 for us, for our children and our community\".[18]\nBoylan plays keyboard instruments, and describes playing in various bands in her autobiography, as well as the zither.[19]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nIn June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, Queerty named her among the fifty heroes \u201cleading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people\u201d.[20][21]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nRemind Me to Murder You Later (1988) ISBN\u00a00-8018-3728-6\nThe Planets (April 15, 1991) ISBN\u00a0978-0671727154\nThe Constellations: A Novel (November 8, 1994) ISBN\u00a0978-0679430216\nGetting In (September 1, 1998) ISBN\u00a0978-0446674171\nShe's Not There: A Life in Two Genders (July 29, 2003) ISBN\u00a0978-0767914048\nI'm Looking Through You: Growing Up Haunted: A Memoir (January 15, 2008) ISBN\u00a0978-0767921749\nFalcon Quinn and the Black Mirror (May 11, 2010) ISBN\u00a0978-0061728327\nFalcon Quinn and the Crimson Vapor (May 10, 2011) ISBN\u00a0978-0061728358\nStuck in the Middle with You: A Memoir of Parenting in Three Genders (April 30, 2013) ISBN\u00a0978-0767921763\nTrans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community (June 10, 2014) ISBN\u00a0978-0199325351\nYou Are You (May 12, 2015) ISBN\u00a0978-3868285406\nFalcon Quinn and the Bullies of Greenblud (September 16, 2016)\nLong Black Veil (April 11, 2017) ISBN\u00a0978-0451496324\nGood Boy: My Life in Seven Dogs (April 21, 2020) ISBN\u00a0978-1250261861\nAnthologies[edit]\nSexual Metamorphosis: An Anthology of Transsexual Memoirs (April 12, 2005) ISBN\u00a0978-1400030149\nThe Book of Dads: Essays on the Joys, Perils, and Humiliations of Fatherhood (May 12, 2009) ISBN\u00a0978-0061711558\nLove Is a Four-Letter Word: True Stories of Breakups, Bad Relationships, and Broken Hearts (July 28, 2009) ISBN\u00a0978-0452295506\nHow Beautiful the Ordinary (October 6, 2009) ISBN\u00a0978-0061154980\nIt Gets Better (March 22, 2011) ISBN\u00a0978-0525952336\nTruth & Dare: 20 Tales of Heartbreak and Happiness (April 26, 2011) ISBN\u00a0978-0762441044\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT culture in New York City\nList of self-identified LGBTQ New Yorkers\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ She's Not There: A Life in Two Genders, Broadway, 2003.\n\n^ https://barnard.edu/profiles/jennifer-boylan\n\n^ a b c d \"Professor Jennifer Finney Boylan (Maine) (May 2011 \u2013 Present)\".

Brennan's musical style contains elements of glam rock, psychedelic soul, R&B, Indie pop and power pop,[3] combined with dense vocal harmonies and revealing literate lyrics that occasionally draw on vaudeville, music hall, mythical and biblical themes.[4] In 2016, Brennan released her first full-length studio album, Debutante, to significant acclaim, landing on numerous best-of-2016 lists including the Village Voice Pazz & Jop list.[5][6][7][8] Her second studio album, Third, was recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis and was released via Omnivore Recordings on April 21, 2017.[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Beginnings (1989\u20132012)\n2 Return to performance and Debutante (2012\u20132016)\n3 Sire Records and Introducing The Breakdown (2016)\n4 Omnivore Recordings and Third (2017\u2013present)\n5 Writing and film\n6 Personal life\n7 Discography\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nBeginnings (1989\u20132012)[edit]\nBrennan was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and raised by her great-grandmother, a Thoroughbred horse racing seamstress. She began writing songs as a child; lacking in musical training, she sang songs into a simple cassette recorder, and eventually began her performance career while beginning a gender transition in her teens. After multiple incidents of violence, she stopped performing publicly for nearly two decades.[9] In 2009, reflecting on her 90s work, Curve declared that Brennan \"almost became the first great transgender rock star.\"[10] Brennan was interviewed by Against Me! frontwoman Laura Jane Grace in episode 3 of Grace's AOL Originals series \"True Trans\".[11][12] Before returning to music, she pursued careers in journalism, screenwriting and acting.\n\nReturn to performance and Debutante (2012\u20132016)[edit]\nEncouraged by friends who had heard her songs, Brennan returned to live performance in 2012, and quickly received praise for her work; Village Voice Media's Serene Dominic praised her as a \"smart, melodic singer-songwriter,\"[13] and an early live performance and interview with Brennan was featured on the KAET/Tempe Center for the Arts public television concert series \"Songwriters Showcase,\" which premiered on PBS stations in fall 2013.[14][15] The Arizona Republic praised the \"cinematic sweep\" of her songs.[16][17] Java Magazine's Mitchell Hillman echoed that praise, calling Brennan \"a great musician and a formidable writer,\"[18] and author Neil Gaiman praised her cover version of David Bowie's Five Years as \"glorious\".[19] While her lead vocals generally hover in the mid-tenor, Brennan has a five-octave range and sings all the background harmonies on her albums.[1] Matt Keeley of Unicorn Booty dubbed her \"Lady Nilsson\" for her frequent homages to the late singer-songwriter.,[12] while International Pop Overthrow founder David Bash praised her as \"a singer songwriter with a unique brand of glitter glam soulful rock n\u2019 roll sung straight from the heart. Plus, you gotta love anyone who can channel Roy Orbison, Elton John, Freddie Mercury, John Lennon, and Etta James in the space of a single set.\"[20]\nHer debut album, Debutante, was co-produced by Brennan and Fernando Perdomo, a producer and rock artist who also co-produced Linda Perhacs' widely acclaimed 2014 album The Soul of All Natural Things for Sufjan Stevens' Asthmatic Kitty records, and has performed with Fiona Apple, Beck, Todd Rundgren and Jakob Dylan.[21] Perdomo and Brennan met as fellow artists on the International Pop Overthrow festival in 2012, and quickly became friends; Brennan appears in Perdomo's \"Smile\" music video,[22] and Perdomo has played in Brennan's touring band.[23]\nThe album was recorded in five days.[24] Brennan funded the initial production of the album through Kickstarter and exceeded her funding goal in just 69 hours.[25] During the campaign, Brennan received social media support from Laura Jane Grace, Neil Gaiman, James Urbaniak and John Darnielle of The Mountain Goats.[26] The first track released from Debutante was \"Dear Arthur,\" which was featured as a Paste exclusive premiere in mid-January 2016.[27] Presenter Ros Barclay of CamGlen Radio in Glasgow was the first terrestrial radio broadcaster to play the song.[28]\nWFMU presenter Evan \"Funk\" Davies was an early champion of Brennan and Debutante, giving the record its first US terrestrial radio airplay and frequently playing numerous tracks from the album on his eponymous show.[29]\nThe album received widespread acclaim, landing on multiple year-end best-of lists including the Village Voice Pazz & Jop list; writing in PopDose, Keith Creighton said Debutante \"...is right up there with the great \"drenched in blood, sweat & tears, leave everything on the table, conquer the world\" albums like Against Me!'s New Wave, Guns & Roses' Appetite for Destruction, Green Day's American Idiot and Smashing Pumpkins' Gish.\"[30] American Songwriter's Peter Gerstenzang said \"Debutante depicts an artist remarkably conversant with the last forty years of Pop, who is able to blend her influences and obsessions into one glimmering musical gem after another.\" Describing the experience of listening to her music in the wake of David Bowie's passing, he said \"Now that we have lost that glorious weirdo, David Bowie, it's also nice to know that a new one, Cait Brennan, is hovering into view...which feels like a bit of solace for those of us who felt Bowie's loss so keenly. In other words, it's nice to have a new songwriter out there, who is so...out there.\"[20] Popshifter's Melissa Bratcher said Brennan \"has one of the best pure rock voices you're likely to hear. Marry that to an insane range and so-sweet-they-melt-in-your-ear harmonies, and then add them to the sundae of glorious melodies and whip-smart lyrics and you've got yourself a mixed metaphor. But you've also got a stunning debut...Cait Brennan has made a glimmering record full of heart and hope and harmony. It's a timeless album; joyful, clever, and wonderful. You owe it to yourself to hear her.[31] The Arizona Republic's Ed Masley said \"This pop classicist has packed her first album with songs that marry timeless hooks to introspective lyrics. Setting the tone with the wistful, Mccartney-esque intro of \"Good Morning and Goodnight\", the singer delivers an album that should speak to several generations of power-pop enthusiasts, whether they cut their teeth on Big Star and the Raspberries or Teenage Fanclub in the '90s.[32] The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Jon M. Gilbertson said the album \"deserves as much attention for its mid-1970s eloquence as for the fact that Brennan is transgender and 46.\"[33] Writing for Rust, Eric Peterson said \"Cait Brennan's music is as powerful and individual as she is, and Debutante is an example of an artist putting everything they have into their work.\"[34] A live album, From The City Of New York, was recorded at Rockwood Music Hall in February 2016 on the abbreviated Debutante tour, and released in June 2016.[35]\n\nSire Records and Introducing The Breakdown (2016)[edit]\nThe independently released Debutante caught the ear of Sire Records President Seymour Stein, who discovered The Ramones, Talking Heads, Madonna and many others. Stein signed Brennan to a demo deal with Sire/Warner Bros. Records in June 2016.[32] Brennan co-produced demos for Sire in Los Angeles with Perdomo and producer Andy Paley, with guests including James King of Fitz and the Tantrums, but Sire ultimately declined to sign Brennan.[36]\nAfter Debutante, Brennan initially announced that the followup would be called Jinx, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Sophomore slump. Initial recording for the second album took place in December 2015.[8] But in March 2016 while on the Debutante tour, Brennan developed a serious infection from a cat bite, and subsequent complications led to a life-threatening illness. The remainder of the tour was canceled, and during her hospital stay and subsequent recovery, Brennan drastically revised the finished Jinx masters and wrote a number of new songs. The resulting album, Introducing The Breakdown According To Cait Brennan, was originally slated for release on Brennan's own Black Market Glamour label, but Brennan ultimately shelved the album for a later date, opting to record an entirely new third album instead, citing both the upheaval in her own life and the uncertainty and change following the 2016 Presidential Election.[37][36]\n\nOmnivore Recordings and Third (2017\u2013present)[edit]\nMain article: Third (Cait Brennan album)\nDuring the Sire Records demo sessions, Brennan and Perdomo attended a Grammy Museum presentation celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Ardent Studios. At the event, Brennan and Perdomo encountered Big Star drummer and Ardent president Jody Stephens, who invited the pair to record their third album at Ardent in Memphis. When the Sire deal did not materialize, the duo traveled to Memphis and recorded 13 songs in three days, with Brennan and Perdomo producing and playing all the instruments, and Ardent's Adam Hill engineering the sessions. During the sessions, the pair used many of the same instruments and amplifiers used by Big Star during their heyday, including Alex Chilton's Hi-Watt amps, Mellotron and Chris Bell's cherry red Gibson guitar. The album was mastered by Grammy-winning audio engineer Michael Graves; Cheryl Pawelski of Omnivore Recordings, who had a long history working with Ardent and Big Star, signed Brennan to Omnivore in January 2017, slating Brennan's Third for an April 2017 release to coincide with Record Store Day.[1][2]\n\nWriting and film[edit]\nBrennan co-wrote the screenplay for the romantic comedy \"Love Or Whatever\",[38] directed by Rosser Goodman, which made its world premiere at the 2012 Frameline Film Festival.[39] She also appears in the film.[38][40] Bay Area critic George Heymont praised the film as \"a rowdy romp\" and \"that rare gem: a sexy and intelligent gay romantic comedy.\"[41][42] TLA Releasing released the film in Fall 2014.[43] While in college, Brennan received the Arizona Commission on the Arts Screenwriting fellowship in 2002,[44] and the following year, she won the Phoenix Film Festival's Best Screenplay award for \"The People's Choice\".[45][46] Brennan was honored with the Outfest Screenwriting Lab Fellowship in 2007 for her comic homage to 1980s John Hughes films, \"Dramatis Personae\".[47][48] In October 2007, the Rhode Island International Film Festival awarded first prize to Brennan and \"Dramatis Personae\" in their annual screenwriting honors.[49] In 2014, Brennan co-wrote (along with writer Doug Bost) the Alzheimer's-focused short \"Policy Of Truth\", directed by Nick Demos.[50]\nIn 2010 she joined the staff of Phoenix's LGBT-focused Echo Magazine.[38][51] and was the magazine's music critic from 2013 to 2016.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn late 2013, Brennan was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's disease, and has cited that diagnosis as ongoing motivation for the burst of creative activity that has followed.[52][53] Her illness has not significantly impacted her ability to record or tour; she pursues an intensive physical and voice therapy regimen to maintain her ability to perform.[36]\nBrennan is bisexual[54][55] and an advocate for LGBT rights, especially for the transgender community.\n\nDiscography[edit]\nStudio albums\n\n2016 \u2013 Debutante\n2017 \u2013 Third\n2018 \u2013 Introducing The Breakdown According To Cait Brennan (completed, announced)[56]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Conqueroo \u2013 Cait Brennan's Third Charts Its Own Groundbreaking Path\".

Brite, is an American author. He initially achieved notoriety in the gothic horror genre of literature in the early 1990s by publishing a string of successful novels and short story collections. His later work moved into the genre of dark comedy, with many stories set in the New Orleans restaurant world. Martin's novels are typically standalone books but may feature recurring characters from previous novels and short stories. Much of his work features openly bisexual and gay characters.\n\nContents\n\n1 Work\n2 Personal life\n3 Retirement and return to writing\n4 Bibliography\n\n4.1 Novels and novellas\n4.2 Short story collections\n4.3 Anthologies (as editor)\n4.4 Short stories\n4.5 Non-fiction\n4.6 Uncollected short fiction\n\n\n5 See also\n6 Notes\n\n\nWork[edit]\nMartin is best known for writing gothic and horror novels and short stories. His trademarks include featuring gay men as main characters, graphic sexual descriptions, and an often wry treatment of gruesome events. Some of Martin's better known novels include Lost Souls (1992), Drawing Blood (1993), and the controversial serial killer novel Exquisite Corpse (1996); he has also released the short fiction collections Wormwood (originally published as Swamp Foetus; 1993), Are You Loathsome Tonight? (also published as Self-Made Man; 1998), Wrong Things (with Caitlin R. Kiernan; 2001), and The Devil You Know (2003). His \"Calcutta: Lord of Nerves\" was selected to represent the year 1992 in the story anthology The Century's Best Horror Fiction.[1]\nIn a 1998 interview,[2] in response to a comment that \"Growing up in the American South [shaped him] as a writer\", Martin mentioned that Southern writers Carson McCullers, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Flannery O'Connor, Harper Lee, Thomas Wolfe and William Faulkner also influenced his writing. Answering a follow-up question about his literary influences, he also included \"Bradbury, Nabokov, W.S. Burroughs, Stephen King, Ramsey Campbell, Shirley Jackson, Thomas Ligotti, Kathe Koja, Dennis Cooper, Dorothy Parker, Dylan Thomas, Harlan Ellison, Peter Straub, Paul Theroux, Baudelaire, Poe, Lovecraft, John Lennon... I could rattle off ten or twenty more easily; they're all in there somewhere.\"\nMartin wrote Courtney Love: The Real Story (1997), a biography of singer Courtney Love that was officially \"unauthorized\", but he acknowledged that the work was done at Love's suggestion and with her cooperation, including access to Love's personal journal and letters.[3]\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Martin moved away from horror fiction and gothic themes while still writing about gay characters. The critically acclaimed Liquor novels\u2014Liquor (2004), Prime (2005), and Soul Kitchen (2006)\u2014are dark comedies set in the New Orleans restaurant world. The Value of X (2002) depicts the beginning of the careers of the protagonists of the Liquor series\u2014Gary \"G-Man\" Stubbs and John \"Rickey\" Rickey; other stories, including several in his most recent collection The Devil You Know (2003) and the novella D*U*C*K, chronicle events in the lives of the extended Stubbs family, a Catholic clan whose roots are sunk deep in the traditional culture of New Orleans. Martin hopes to eventually write three more novels in the Liquor series, tentatively titled Dead Shrimp Blues, Hurricane Stew, and Double Shot. However, in late 2006, he ceased publishing with Three Rivers Press, the trade paperback division of Random House that published the first three Liquor novels, and is currently taking a hiatus from fiction writing. He has described Antediluvian Tales, a short story collection published by Subterranean Press in November 2007, as \"if not my last book ever, then my last one for some time.\" He still writes short non-fiction pieces, including guest editorials for the New Orleans Times-Picayune and a food article for Chile Pepper Magazine.\nMartin has often stated that, while he will allow some of his work to be optioned for film under the right circumstances, he has little interest in movies and is not overly eager to see his work filmed. In 1999, his short story The Sixth Sentinel (filmed as The Dream Sentinel) comprised one segment of episode 209 of The Hunger, a short-lived horror anthology series on Showtime.\nCritical essays on Martin's fiction appear in Supernatural Fiction Writers: Contemporary Fantasy and Horror (2003) by Brian Stableford[4] and The Evolution of the Weird Tale (2004) by S. T. Joshi.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMartin was born in Bowling Green, Warren County, Kentucky, at Western University Hospital.[5] He has written and talked extensively about his gender dysphoria and transgender issues.[6] He is a gay man, and has said, \"Ever since I was old enough to know what gay men were, I've considered myself a gay man that happens to have been born in a female body, and that's the perspective I'm coming from.\"[6] In 2003, Martin wrote that, while gender theorists like Kate Bornstein would call him a \"nonoperative transsexual\", Martin would not insist on a label, writing \"I'm just me\".[7] In August 2010, he began hormone therapy, and in 2011 expressed that he would prefer to be referred to by male pronouns.[8]\nHe lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and Athens, Georgia prior to moving to New Orleans in 1993.\nMartin was the longtime partner of Chris DeBarr, a chef, but the couple split in 2011. His current partner is Grey Cross, a New Orleans visual artist and photographer.\nOn January 6, 2009, Martin was arrested at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church in New Orleans as part of a peaceable demonstration in which churches in the Uptown area of the city were occupied to protest their closings.[9] In August 2009, New Orleans's Gambit Weekly publication published reader-poll results naming Martin in second place as an ever-popular \"Best Local Author.\"[10]\n\nRetirement and return to writing[edit]\nOn June 9, 2010, Martin officially stated that he was retired from writing, in a post entitled \"I'm Basically Retired (For Now)\" on his Livejournal.[11] He stated that he had \"completely lost the ability to interact with [his] body of work\" and then went on to state that business issues were a partial cause. He also specifically mentioned being unable to disconnect from aspects of his life relating to Hurricane Katrina. He ended his statement by saying that he missed having relationships with his characters and that he did not feel the need to write for publication. Martin has since created a series of artworks themed on New Orleans and voodoo.\nIn 2018, Martin announced he had returned to writing with a non-fiction project entitled Water If God Wills It: Religion and Spirituality In The Work of Stephen King.[12] Martin opened a Patreon page to finance the book.\n\nBibliography[edit]\nNovels and novellas[edit]\nLost Souls (1992)\nDrawing Blood (1993)\nExquisite Corpse (1996)\nThe Crow: The Lazarus Heart (1998)\n\"Plastic Jesus\" (novella; 2000)\nThe Liquor series:\nThe Value of X (2002)\nLiquor (2004)\nPrime (2005)\nSoul Kitchen (2006)\nD*U*C*K (novella; 2007)\nTriads (with Christa Faust; 2004)\nSecond Line (2009)[13]\nShort story collections[edit]\nWormwood (also published in limited edition and in the UK under author's original title as Swamp Foetus; 1993)\nHis Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood and Other Stories (\"Four stories of contemporary horror\", selected from Wormwood; Penguin 60s, 1995)[14]\nAre You Loathsome Tonight?

Broadnax (December 28, 1916[1] \u2013 June 1, 1992[2]), also known as \"Wilbur\", \"Willie\", and \"Wilmer\", was an American hard gospel quartet singer during the golden age of traditional black gospel. His most common nickname was \"Little Axe,\" due to both his small stature and his brother William \"Big Axe\" Broadnax, who was a popular baritone.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Later years and death\n4 Legacy\n5 Discography\n\n5.1 Little Axe and the Golden Echoes\n5.2 The Spirit of Memphis Quartet\n5.3 The Fairfield Four\n5.4 The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi\n5.5 Compilations\n\n\n6 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBroadnax was born in Houston, Texas in 1916, to William Broadnax and Gussie Frazier. By 1930 he lived with his step-father Augustus Flowers, mother Gussie Frazier, younger brother William Broadnax, and younger step-sister Armatha Broadnax in Houston.[4] Broadnax was assigned female at birth, a fact which was only discovered upon his death and leads to confusion surrounding his early life.[5]\nAlthough Willmer was the oldest of the three Broadnax children, most sources state that Willmer was the younger of the two brothers [3][6]. As Armatha Broadnax is unmentioned after the 1930 census, it is possible Armatha took on Willmer's name after his death and truly was William's younger sibling. This would mean that Willmer Broadnax as known today was born in 1922 in Louisiana to Augustus Flowers and Gussie Frazier.[6] It is also possible that Willmer was in fact the older brother and had already started using male pronouns by age thirteen, and that later he was mistaken as the younger brother because of his high voice and short stature.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\nBroadnax began his career as a gospel singer during his teenage years with his brother William as a member of the St. Paul Gospel Singers in Houston in the 1930s.[6] The two brothers moved to Los Angeles and joined Southern Gospel Singers, of which Willmer was a member of from 1939-1940; the group only performed on weekends and did not tour.[1]\nThe brothers eventually broke off to form their own quartet, Little Axe and the Golden Echoes. Although William eventually left for Atlanta, where he joined the Five Trumpets, Willmer stayed on as lead singer throughout the 1940s. In 1949 the group, augmented by future member of The Soul Stirrers Paul Foster (singer), recorded a single of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" for Specialty Records. Label chief Art Rupe decided to drop them before they could record a follow-up, and shortly thereafter the Golden Echoes disbanded.[1]\nPianist Willie Love said during this period that, \"Little Axe couldn\u2019t sing low, because he had a relatively high voice. It wasn\u2019t falsetto, it was naturally high. So somebody had to sing the bottom.\" [3] His point is clear in the recordings of the Golden Echoes, where Paul Foster's rich baritone and Broadnax's clear tenor riff off each other to create the illusion of a multi-octave lead singer. As music critic Ray Funk points out, \"Little Axe\u2019s lead is absolutely distinctive on these cuts. He is the high lead that takes over from the baritone of Paul Foster. His voice is sweet but almost vicious, dripping with emotion, while Foster, in contrast, would offer almost a growl.\" [3]\nIn 1950, Broadnax joined the Spirit of Memphis Quartet. Along with Broadnax, the group featured two other leads \u2013 Jethro \"Jet\" Bledsoe, a bluesy crooner, and Silas Steele, an overpowering baritone. The Spirit of Memphis Quartet recorded for King Records, and Broadnax appeared on their releases at least until 1952. Shortly after that, Broadnax moved on, working with The Fairfield Four, and in the early 1960s as one of the replacements for Archie Brownlee in the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. Until 1965 Wilmer headed a quartet called \"Little Axe and the Golden Echoes,\" which released some singles on Peacock Records. By then, quartet singing was fading in commercial viability, and Broadnax retired from touring.[7]\nIn retirement, Broadnax continued to record new material occasionally with the Blind Boys into the 1970s and 1980s.[7]\n\nLater years and death[edit]\nBroadnax was killed in 1992 by his lover Lavina Richardson (age 42 at the time), who was later found guilty of involuntary manslaughter on February 4, 1993. Leading up to the stabbing, Broadnax had allegedly been jealous of Richardson. Broadnax saw Richardson in a vehicle with another man, bumped his car into theirs, and dragged Richardson out. He then threatened her with a knife before he was disarmed by a bystander, whereupon Richardson picked up his knife and stabbed him three times. Broadnax died from his injuries several days later on June 1, 1992.[2]\nUpon Broadnax's death in 1992, it was discovered that Broadnax was a trans man.[5] This created a stir in the gospel community, with many prominent singers at the time insisting that they had suspected all along that his gender assigned at birth was female, including JoJo Wallace of the Sensational Nightingales who said, \"I always wondered about Axe.\" However, it is more likely that only his brother William \"Big Axe\" Broadnax and other close family members knew about his gender identity.[3]\nThe intersection of Broadnax's gender and race created some issues for him on tour as public bathrooms were segregated. It was not uncommon for many gospel singers to be unable to use public restrooms where they performed. Broadnax was forced to keep his gender identity a secret by using the restroom alone, which also provoked from retrospective suspicion by Claude Jeter who said, \"Ax\u2019d always go off by himself.\" [3]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Little Axe and the Golden Echoes among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[8]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nLittle Axe and the Golden Echoes[edit]\nThe Lord Is My Sunshine / Remember Me, Peacock Records, 1963\nMy Mind On Jesus / Jesus Loves Me, Peacock Records, 1963\nMy Life Is In His Hands / So Soon, Peacock Records, 1964\nLord Have Mercy / Swing Down Chariot, Peacock Records, 1965\nOld Time Religion, Specialty Records / Ace Records (United States), 1992 [9]\nAmerican Pop / Gospel's Golden Age, Volume 3 (1945 - 1959), Collector Records, 2012 [10]\nThe Spirit of Memphis Quartet[edit]\nMake More Room For Jesus / Calvary, King Records, 1950\nHow Far Am I From Canaan / I'll Never Forget, King Records, 1950\nOn The Battlefield / Jesus, Jesus, King Records, 1950\nDays Past And Gone/Blessed Are The Dead, King Records, 1950\nTell Heaven I'm Coming / Ten Commandments, King Records, 1951\nSign Of The Judgement / Every Time I Feel The Spirit, King Records, 1951\nThe World Prayer / Every Day And Every Hour, King Records, 1951\nLord Jesus Part 1 / Lord Jesus Part 2, King Records, 1952 [11]\nThe Fairfield Four[edit]\nCome Over Here/Who Is That Knocking, Dot Records, 1953\nHis Eye Is on the Sparrow/Every Day, Dot Records, 1953\nHow I Got Over/This Evening Our Father, Dot Records, 1953\nStand by Me/Hear Me When I Pray, Dot Records, 1953\nWhen The Battle Is Over/Standing on the Rock, Dot Records, 1953\nSomebody Touched Me/Mother Don't Worry, Dot Records, 1953 [12]\nThe Five Blind Boys of Mississippi[edit]\nPrecious Memories, Peacock Records, 1960\nI Call On Jesus / Time To Think About The Lord, Peacock Records, 1960\nI Never Heard A Man, Peacock Records, 1960\nSending Up My Timber, Peacock Records, 1961\nCan't Serve The Lord / Constantly Abiding, Peacock Records, 1961\nFive Blind Boys* / Spirit Of Memphis - Negro Spirituals, Peacock Records, 1961\nFather I Stretched My Hands To Thee / Lord Remember Me, Peacock Records, 1962\nI Got It Within Me / The Tide Of Life, Peacock Records, 1962\nYou Done What The Doctor Couldn't Do / Speak For Jesus, Peacock Records, 1963\nJust A Little While / Servant's Prayer, Peacock Records, 1963\nSomething To Shout About / Leaning On Jesus, Peacock Records, 1964\nFather I Stretch My Hand to Thee, Peacock Records, 1964\nLift The Savior Up / In The Hands Of The Lord, Peacock Records, 1965\nMy Soul Is A Witness / Love Lifted Me, Peacock Records, 1970\nOh Well, What Can You Do / I Have But One Desire, Peacock Records, 1974 [13]\nCompilations[edit]\nSo Many Years, Jubilee Records, 1989 [14]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c  Jason Ankeny. \"The Golden Echoes\".

He moved from Charleston to Charlotte, North Carolina, when he was 12.[2]\nBrockington was assigned female at birth and identified as such until he came out publicly as transgender while attending East Mecklenburg High School as a tenth grade student. His family was not supportive of his decision to transition, wondering why a black youth would want to draw more attention to himself. Because of this, Brockington chose to live with a foster family during his transition.[1][3] He chose the name Blake after it came to him in a dream and because he liked how masculine it sounded.[4] He was taking testosterone, which was covered by Medicaid, and had planned to get a mastectomy once he was able to afford it.[2]\nHe spent two years as a drum major for East Mecklenburg High School's band.[4]\nIn 2014, Brockington received national attention for being the first openly transgender high school homecoming king in North Carolina after collecting the most money for East Mecklenburg High School's chosen charity, Mothering Across Continents. He later indicated the process had been tough on him, saying, \"That was single-handedly the hardest part of my trans journey. Really hateful things were said on the Internet. It was hard. I saw how narrow-minded the world really is.\"[1][2][3][4]\nAfter his election as homecoming king, he began publicly advocating for transgender and LGBT youth issues.[1] He spoke at the 2014 Transgender Day of Remembrance service in Charlotte.[5] In December 2014 at Charlotte's Independence Square, he organized a protest against police brutality against black people. He was involved with setting up an exhibit, \"Publicly Identified: Coming Out Activist in the Queen City\" , at the Levine Museum of the New South in July 2014.[4] Brockington was also mentoring transgender youth. He spoke in an 8-minute documentary made in 2014 by three Elon University students, \"BrocKINGton\", about his experience being bullied because he was transgender, and being hospitalized for self-harming.[4][6]\nHe was active in the faith community, and participated in the Trans Faith and Action Network Conference held in Charlotte in August 2014.[5]\nBrockington was enrolled at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, majoring in music education. At the time of his death, he was on medical leave and not attending classes. He stated that his plans were to become a band director and composer.[4]\n\nDeath[edit]\nPrior to his death, Brockington had indicated that he had experienced years of depression and destructive behavior, such as self-harming. He also indicated that he had previously had suicidal thoughts.[2] Two months prior to his death, he posted on his Tumblr page \"Even if I got better in my head, I would never want to continue on in a world like this.\" A month prior, he posted \"I\u2019m waiting on the moment when me and my darkness split from my body.\" One week before his death, he posted \"being in my head is like being a quarterback playing against an entire defensive line.\" Finally, on the day of his death, he posted \"I am so exhausted.\"[4]\nBrockington died on March 23, 2015 after being struck by several vehicles on the outer loop of Interstate 485 near Pavilion Boulevard in Charlotte. The incident was considered a suicide and was similar in nature to the suicides of Ash Haffner and Leelah Alcorn.[4]\nBrockington was laid to rest in Ravenel, South Carolina by his family on March 28, 2015.[4][5]\n\nReaction[edit]\nIn his obituary, Brockington's family, still unaccepting of his identity as a transgender male, used she/her pronouns and referred to him by his birth name. Shortly before his death, he had told the media that he was not in contact with a lot of his family.[4]\nOn March 24, 2015, the day after Brockington's death, about 100 people came to the North Davidson Street headquarters of Time Out Youth, where Brockington had been a client, to share stories and comfort each other.[4]\nSoutherners On New Ground held a memorial service for Brockington in Durham, North Carolina on March 28, 2015.[5]\nThree dozen members of the Charlotte community attended a memorial service for Brockington held on March 29, 2015 at Sacred Souls Community Church.[4] Rodney McKenzie, the National LGBTQ Task Force's director of faith work, travelled from New York City to attend the service and remarked, \"This is a loss for you all and a loss for our movement and our world. ... All of us were incredibly touched and incredibly sad. ... This is something touching all us, everywhere.\" Campus Pride's executive director, Shane Windmeyer, remarked at the service, \"Days like today, the weeks recently, it hurts more and more. ... It is a tragic reminder of our duty as individuals to do more, to try better in changing lives and saving lives.\" Brockington's partner, Flo Ethier, read what was Brockington's favorite biblical passage, 1 Corinthians 13.[5]\nMany have noted that what happened to Brockington fits a dangerous pattern of harmful behavior by transgender youth \u2013 who often face disproportionate amounts of bullying, harassment, discrimination, and violence. Josh Burford, assistant director for sexual and gender diversity at UNC Charlotte, who had worked with Brockington on the exhibit at the Levine Museum, told the press \"What happened to Blake is part of a systemic problem, especially for trans students of color. He didn\u2019t quit. He didn\u2019t give up. ... He\u2019s a victim of what happens every single day to these kids.\"[4]\nOther memorial services were held in cities such as Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and an additional service in Charlotte.[5]\nIn 2018 the LGBTQ community archive project was officially named the \"King-Henry-Brockington Community archive\" to carry on the legacy of Blake's impact on the local Charlotte Community.  Josh Burford, who had worked with Blake, decided to include Blake's name as a permanent reminder of the work of this young activist.\n\nSee also[edit]\nSuicide among LGBT youth\nList of LGBT-related suicides\nList of transgender people\nUnited States portalTransgender portalLGBT portal\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d Young, Danielle (March 31, 2015). \"Transgender Activist & Homecoming King Tragically Commits Suicide\".

As a performance artist, Cadell was particularly known for performing with a heating duct to add reverb.[4]\nCadell soon signed to Intrepid Records, and recorded with Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies, Bob Wiseman and members of Rheostatics.  Those sessions were released in 1991 as the album Angel Food for Thought, whose first single \"The Sweater\" became a surprise Top 40 hit in Canada in 1992 and was very popular on college radio and alternative stations in the states. \"The Sweater\" is a spoken word monologue, with a musical backing track\u2014the first 20 seconds of Syd Dale's \"Walk & Talk.\" The monologue revolves around a girl's thoughts about a boy's sweater.\nIn 1993, Cadell released a follow-up album, Bombazine, on Sire Records. This album featured guest appearances by Rheostatics, Ben Mink, Tyler Stewart, Anne Bourne and John Alcorn. Following the album, Cadell took a hiatus from music to do human rights work with PEN Canada. Cadell also wrote an independent film, which was never produced.\nIn 1997, Cadell returned to music with the album 6 Blocks on the independent label Handsome Boy Records.[6]\nGuest performers on this outing included Anne Bourne, Mary Margaret O'Hara, Chris Wardman and Jason Sniderman (Blue Peter), Paul Brennan (Odds) and Martin Tielli.\nFollowing that album, Cadell retired from the music business. He publicly came out as transgender on Bill Richardson's CBC Radio One program Bunny Watson on October 2, 2004, although he had already been out to friends and family for a number of years.\nIn 2007, Bongo Beat released an expanded edition of Angel Food for Thought, including two tracks that were previously available only on cassette as well as the video for \"The Sweater\".

As a member of the LGBT community as well as a young immigrant, Corado found it challenging to settle in her newfound community.[5] Her bumpy arrival and settlement also led her to discover how few resources were offered for the LGBT community within Washington D.C. This was one of her first motivators to be a part of creating a welcoming community for transgender people as well as the other people who make up the LGBT community.[5]\nShe came out as a gay man, a label that never felt comfortable for Corado. Eventually, she would come to terms with her identity as a transgender woman. After coming out as gay in her teens, Corado faced bullying from others since she was more feminine male. An incident that occurred was when she was tormented in her school\u2019s bathroom. Other boys her age followed and attacked her for being a \u201cfeminine boy\u201d. This was just the beginning for Corado. This is part of what sparked the call for action to protect those in a community that was not fully understood.\nHer home life was not much better than her school life. She was ostracised by her own family.\nCorado would experience many setbacks because of her identity as a transgender woman and wouldn\u2019t begin transitioning until the 1990s.[4] Some of these experiences would range from homelessness to being fired from her jobs because of her identity. Several acts of violence would be directed toward her one which would almost cost her life. Such experiences would make her realize that she needed to fight back against the oppression she was facing. In fact, it is these experiences that would provide the foundation for the actions she took in the future.\nCorado felt it was safe enough to finally live life as a woman full time. She had been living in what she had considered a well-rounded neighborhood. However, this all changed in 1995 with the death of Tyra Hunter, a transgender woman, who died of injuries sustained in a car accident after EMS personnel refused to treat her.[6]  With the realization that people weren\u2019t as accepting, it further fueled her to fight for transgender rights as she recognized people shouldn\u2019t be living in constant fear for being who they were.  She started volunteering at Whitman-Walker Health, a health center focused on HIV/AIDS care for LGBT patients, doing things like distributing condoms.  A few years later once she made the transition from male to female, she won a pageant, Miss Gay El Salvador, which came with an expectation of community service.\nIt is also worth noting that there was a point in her life where she worked as a sex worker. Her reasoning behind this didn\u2019t have to do with survival. Rather it focused on being able to meet up with men without having to tell them that she was a transgender woman. She worked for an agency which would sell each encounter for three-hundred dollars. Although said agency would take most if not all of the profits she earned from her work as an escort. \nIn fact, one of the greatest struggles she endured was overcoming some emotional trauma caused by her now ex-boyfriend who had broke into her house in 2008 beat and raped her. Although this attack on her was reported, the police never did any further investigation nor did the prosecute the culprit.  In that same year in 2008, there was also an incident that occurred between Corado and her then boyfriend. There was a fight that had abrupted between the two. This landed them both a night in jail. During this time, she was subjected to be incarcerated with men rather than with women despite her identifying as a woman. She was forced to strip down her articles of clothing in front of the other men in the jail\u2019s housing unit for men. She even had to endure the embarrassment of having to use the bathroom in front of the men in her cell. These incidences would cause her to leave her day job and spiral downward as she began heavily taking drugs and would become homeless. Overcome with a feeling of helplessness, Ruby would struggle with suicidal thoughts all while trying to continue her career as an activist. Eventually around 2011 she\u2019d check herself into a mental hospital to seek out the help she needed. What fueled her to go on despite everything she had endured was the knowledge that other people similar to her would need her assistance.\nCorado has found herself to have overcome a long journey throughout her time in the United States. She had overall endured being a victim of the human sex trafficking industry, endured mistreatment from being transgender, spent time struggling with homelessness, battled to be able to change her gender on her identification card, and was almost killed in a domestic violence dispute. Overall, she has overcome a lot in her years and still continues to fight for others in her community. \nWith even being close to having no money, Corado still put her efforts into creating a safe space for youth who were facing some of the struggle that come with being transgender and the need for another line of support.\nHaving overcome so many horrible obstacles that come with being a transgender person in America, as well having struggled with the lack of support and resources for the LGBT community within Washington D.C., Corado  set out to create a space where she could help individuals heal, and hopefully help prevent these hate crimes from happening to other transgender people as well as others within the LGBTQ+ community. With the help of her friends and her community, Corado was able to create and found Casa Ruby, her non-profit organization that helps house, treat, and support mostly LGBTQ youth in 2012. In 2012 the first Casa Ruby center had opened.[7] The first building occupied three floors of a house in Park View on Georgia Avenue NW, the center primarily aimed to serve the Latina-trans community, but plenty of races and gender variants of the LGBTQ community have heavily relied on the Casa Ruby organization. Today there are now multiple establishments with approximately 50 employees and an outreach that affects the lives of over 6,000 people annually.[7] It provides services to a range of marginalized groups who, due to language or immigration status, often don\u2019t know what resources are available to them. This program does what it cans to locate the available sources for those struggling in the community. The support from Casa Ruby also includes services for violence, poverty, HIV risk and testing, as well as discrimination. A big idea for Casa Ruby is that they do not want to make anyone fear exclusion, discrimination, and discouragement for being who they truly are on the inside and out.\nAside from her organization, Casa Ruby, Ruby is also a bilingual motivational speaker, and a nationally acclaimed sensitivity trainer who speaks mostly towards the social justice issues pertaining to transgender people, gender-nonconforming individuals, as well as the rest of the LGBT community. She does her motivational speaking as well as her sensitivity training in both English and Spanish to help spread her message on both ends of her communities, as well as educate those of the LGBTQ+ community within the U.S. who are at a disadvantage in terms of education  and history because they do not speak or understand much English.  This work coincides well with her activism that also consists to fighting for more rights, tolerance, and greater protection for the LGBTQ community, even more specifically transgender individuals.[7]\n\nAdvocacy career[edit]\nCorado became widely known after the August 16th, 2003 murder of Bella Evangelista,[8] a 25 year old transgender Latina killed during a month that included the murder of another transgender woman in Washington, DC. Corado helped organize daily vigils[9] and a march to demand an end to the violence and recognition of human rights of transgender people.  Corado was part of the Coalition to Clarify the D.C. Human Rights Act (later renamed the D.C. Trans Coalition),[10] which changed the D.C. Human Rights Act to include protections for gender identity or expression, a change that took effect in March 2006.[11] In June 2012, she established Casa Ruby[12] in the Park View neighborhood and in 2018 the organization moved to Shepherd Park. Corado married David Walker in 2014, and was walked down the aisle by D.C. mayor Vincent C. Gray.[13]\n\nCreation of Casa Ruby[edit]\nOne of Corado\u2019s main goals with Casa Ruby was to create a movement led by people society deemed disposable.[14] She aimed to make a loving and nurturing environment that showed people acceptance for their identity. This idea of hers was conceived thirty years ago and was founded by Ruby with the help of friends and community.[15] Ruby\u2019s aim was to provide an environment in which people didn\u2019t feel the need to hide their true selves. In helping others, she aims to provide the help and services that weren't available to her when she was first adjusting to her life in the United States. More than that, however, Corado wants to show that it is possible to live a successful life as an LGBT person. \nAnother motivation Corado would have for making Casa Ruby was the enormous lack of resources for transgender people within Washington, D.C, more specifically transgender people of color. In making Casa Ruby, Corado was able to ensure a space where people could relate to the experiences of those around them. Casa Ruby is also the only bilingual and multicultural LGBTQ+ center in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\nThe mission statement for Casa Ruby reads as \u201cOur mission is to create success life stories among transgender, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals. Our vision is to create a world where transgender, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming people pursue their dreams and achieve success in their lives without fear of discrimination, harassment, or violence due to their sexual orientation and or gender identity/gender expression.\u201d\nAs a result, Casa Ruby has been described with descriptive adjectives such as multicultural and bilingual. That is to say, the establishment primarily places its focus on offering services that can allow people to get a grasp of their lives and adapt to life in the United States. Casa Ruby has services that try to aid others in a variety of different methods.  Some examples being some services that help those who might be in need of housing, or helping others obtain a job through their connections with local restaurants. Casa Ruby tries to help people adapt to their situation by offering emotional and financial support. Furthermore, it teaches English to those who don't know are unfamiliar with the language.\nAnother unique trait Casa Ruby offers through their numerous programs and resources is outreach and assistance for those of the multicultural LGBTQ+ community who are immigrants and have a criminal record and/or criminal convictions. The organization provides these people with resources, support, and representation to fight their deportation and access within the United States.[7]\nThe community in which Casa Ruby serves typically falls within the annual income range that falls below 10,000 dollars. Their organization also runs career employment services, crisis intervention, and other support groups targeted towards the homeless and immigrant transgender individuals of their community.  Another service that they offer a 24 hour drop-in/respite service to those who are either abandoned, homeless, or are in a need of a place to stay, which is a huge testament to Ruby\u2019s welcoming attitude and focus for her organization.[7]\nTheir housing placement program spans far beyond their 24-hour shelter policy as well. Ruby has organized multiple housing programs that span from 24-hour open housing services that are open during weather emergencies to prevent hypothermia and other weather-related injuries to the homeless community. They also provide short term living placement which offers short term consistent housing services for three to six months at a time. This program is for 18 to 24-year-olds and is created to help people transition into permanent living situations. Casa Ruby\u2019s last offer within their housing program is their transitional living program. This offers stable housing and support for up to 18 months and is also in place in order to help clients find educational and foundational backing before they pursue independent living.[7]\nNot only has Ruby created an organization where transgender people and people of the LGBTQ+ community can stay the night, get employment counseling, and housing placement, they also offer numerous other connections for the LGBTQ+ community. These services include preventative health care which is specifically focused on sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and AIDS. There is also another program within Casa Ruby that helps with the emotional and mental trauma that comes with the abuse that can stem from being a member of the LGBTQ+ community, especially being a transgender person.  This program is called the \u201cSupport Services for Victims of Violence\u201d and provides one-on-one counseling and aid to any victims that have suffered from physical, mental, or emotional abuse. Casa Ruby also offers Social Services which can connect people with Social Workers to help them attain government-issued identification and many other legal acquisitions.[7]\nIt is important to note that the motto for CasaRuby is \u201cEveryone\u2019s Home\u201d meaning that is not limited solely for the LGBTQ+ community but rather all people who are in need of its services. This could mean the families of someone within the LGBT community or other members within or involved in this community. \nCasa Ruby is working to make themselves known over social media through their facebook page. This is done in order to make their community presence more known. To add on to this, this allows for the group to be found through the internet. The page is often updated to keep everyone informed on current issues and events within their group as well as the LGBTQ+ community. Currently, almost 12,000 people are following this page. Another form of social media that they are on is Twitter as well as Instagram. Having a larger online presents makes for their community to be stronger.\nCorado works tirelessly to make her establishment seem like a home away from home. This is both displayed within the numerous programs she has in place for her clients, as well as the vast amount of support she is able to provide from both herself and those who volunteer within the organization. She tends to refer to residents as sons and daughters to emphasize the idea of a chosen family. She emphasizes the idea of a chosen family to make up for the fact that some families can be extremely unaccepting at times.  She has created a community in which everyone tries to help one another as they overcome their struggles.\n\nCorado's Current Work[edit]\nCurrently, Corado's work has the most presence in regards to the Trump Administration. In particular,  she has spoken out against the administrations consideration to define one's gender based on the genitalia that individual was born with.  In response, Corado would  talk about the issue at hand to the media and generally anyone who would hear her. She would also be a part of a crowd holding signs along the lines of\u00a0: Enough we will not be erased. She\u2019s aware of the seriousness of the issue and strives to continue to bring awareness to the issue because it is one that is so important. Despite the hardship she has to overcome, she seems enthusiastic about the work recognizing that it has  brought people together and emphasized the support that is present for the transgender community.[16]\nIn this particular case like many others, Corado uses her identity as a transgender woman, as well as her cultural and bilingual background to reassure others that everything will be okay despite the hardships they have to face. She uses herself as an example to highlight that transgender people can live successful lives, as well as dedicating her own life to the betterment of other transgender youths to help them lead their own successful future.\nRuby is also still an active participant in Casa Ruby which is continuing to grow in size and client base. There are now currently fifty employees and the program reaches about six thousand clients annually.\n\nAwards and recognition[edit]\nThis article contains content that is written like an advertisement.

Through puberty, Cossey was distinctly feminine in appearance due to a variant of Klinefelter's syndrome, where, instead of having the XY  chromosome pattern, she possesses the genotype XXXY[1][3] (people with Klinefelter's syndrome usually have XXY).  In Cossey's autobiography My Story, she describes an unhappy childhood, where she suffered confusing feelings and bullying by peers due to her femininity.[3] Growing up, Cossey's closest companion was her sister, Pam, with whom she played dress up in their mother's clothes.[1] Cossey left formal schooling when she was fifteen, and found work in a clothing store and as a butcher's apprentice. At sixteen she moved to London and worked at a variety of low-wage jobs.[3]\nCossey started transitioning while working as an usherette in London's West End.[3] By 17, Cossey was receiving hormone therapy, working full-time in a female gender role as a showgirl.[3] Following breast augmentation surgery, Cossey worked as a showgirl in Paris and as a topless dancer in Rome to save up for sex reassignment surgery (SRS). After years of hormonal treatment and counseling, and legally changing her name, Cossey had her final surgery on 31 December 1974 at Charing Cross Hospital, London.[1]\n\nModelling career and outing by the tabloid press[edit]\nCossey now began an active social life as a woman, concealing her transition.[3] Asked about her dating life, Cossey replied, \"I'm afraid I went a little wild\".[1] She told tabloids she had a romance with the television presenter Des Lynam, though Lynam says he does not recall it.[4] Lynam however mentions going on dates with her in his autobiography. Cossey worked as a model under the name \"Tula\". She appeared in top magazines such as Australian Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, and worked extensively as a glamour model. She was a Page Three Girl for the British tabloid The Sun and appeared in Playboy in 1991.[3]\nIn 1978, Tula won a part on the game show 3-2-1. A tabloid journalist then contacted her, revealing he had discovered she was transgender, and planned to write about it. Other journalists researched her past, attempting to interview her family members. Cossey dropped out of the show, convincing the producers to release her from her contract. After this incident, Tula maintained a lower profile, accepting only smaller assignments.[3]\nTula was cast as an extra in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only.[5] Shortly after the film's release, the tabloid News of the World came out with a front-page headline that read \"James Bond Girl Was a Boy.\" By her own accounts, Tula was so upset she contemplated suicide. However, she continued her modelling career.[3] Tula responded by releasing I Am a Woman, her first autobiography.[6]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nTula became engaged to Count Glauco Lasinio, an Italian advertising executive, who was the first man to date her knowing of her past. He encouraged her to petition for changes in the British law concerning transsexuals. The engagement ended, but her legal efforts continued for seven years, eventually reaching the European Court of Human Rights.[1][7]\nIn 1985, Tula appeared extensively in the video for The Power Station's \"Some Like It Hot\", also appearing in the band's video for \"Get It On\". After breaking up with Lasinio, Tula met Elias Fattal, a businessman, who was unaware of her history until he proposed marriage on St Valentine's Day 1988. When she told him, rather than rejecting her, he merely asked if she would convert to Judaism. She agreed.[1] They were married on 21 May 1989, just weeks after the European Court of Human Rights decided legally to recognise Tula as a woman. They returned from their honeymoon to find that the News of the World had published a story on their wedding.\nOn 27 September 1990, the European Court overturned its decision on a British government appeal.[1] (The right of transgender people in the United Kingdom to change their legal sex would not be granted until the Gender Recognition Act 2004.) Tula returned to modelling, which she had given up four years earlier.[1]\nIn 1991, Tula released My Story, her second autobiography. In it she gave details of her transition and her unsuccessful battle with the European Court. She was featured in the September 1991 issue of Playboy, in a pictorial, \"The Transformation of Tula\", as an acknowledged transgender person.[8]\nTula married Canadian David Finch in 1992.[9] They live together in Kennesaw near Atlanta, Georgia, US.\n\nBibliography[edit]\nTula (1982).

In April 2014, Cox was honored by GLAAD with its Stephen F. Kolzak Award for her work as an advocate for the transgender community.[12] In June 2014, Cox became the first openly transgender person to appear on the cover of Time magazine.[6][13][14] Cox is the first openly transgender person to appear on the cover of a Cosmopolitan magazine, with her February 2018 cover on the South African edition.[15] She is also the first openly transgender person to have a wax figure of herself at Madame Tussauds.[16]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Impact\n4 Honors and awards\n5 Filmography\n\n5.1 Film\n5.2 Television\n\n\n6 Discography\n\n6.1 Soundtrack albums\n6.2 Singles\n\n\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 Further reading\n10 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nLaverne Cox was born in Mobile, Alabama,[17] and was raised by a single mother and grandmother within the AME Zion church.[18] She has an identical twin brother, M Lamar,[19] who portrayed the pre-transitioning Sophia (as Marcus) in Orange Is the New Black.[20][21][22] Cox has stated that she attempted suicide at the age of 11, when she noticed that she had developed feelings for her male classmates and had been bullied for several years for not acting \"the way someone assigned male at birth was supposed to act.\"[18][23][24]\nShe is a graduate of the Alabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham, Alabama, where she studied creative writing before switching to dance.[25] She then studied for two years at Indiana University Bloomington[26] before transferring to Marymount Manhattan College in New York City, where she switched from dancing (specifically classical ballet)[27] to acting.[21][28] During her first season on Orange Is the New Black, she was still appearing at a restaurant on the Lower East Side as a drag queen (where she had applied initially to work as a waitress).[29]\n\nCareer[edit]\n Laverne Cox at PaleyFest 2014 representing Orange is the New Black.\nCox appeared as a contestant on the first season of I Want to Work for Diddy; afterwards she was approached by VH1 about show ideas.[30] From that came the makeover television series TRANSform Me, which made Cox the first African-American transgender person to produce and star in her own TV show.[31][32] Both those shows were nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for outstanding reality program, and when Diddy won in 2009, Cox accepted the award at the ceremony, giving a speech described by the San Francisco Sentinel as \"among the most poignant because [it] reminded us how important it is to tell our stories, all of our stories.\"[33][34][35] She has also acted in a number of TV shows and films, including Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Bored to Death, and Musical Chairs.\nIn 2013, Cox began her recurring role in the Netflix series Orange is the New Black as Sophia Burset, a trans woman sent to prison for credit-card fraud. In that year, she stated, \"Sophia is written as a multi-dimensional character who the audience can really empathize with\u2014all of the sudden they're empathizing with a real Trans person. And for Trans folks out there, who need to see representations of people who are like them and of their experiences, that's when it becomes really important.\"[36] Cox's role in Orange is the New Black provides her a platform to speak on the rights of trans people.\nIn January 2014, Cox joined trans woman Carmen Carrera on Katie Couric's syndicated show, Katie. Couric referred to transgender people as \"transgenders\", and after being rebuffed by Carrera on the subject of her surgeries, specifically what genital reconstruction she had done, turned the same question to Cox. Cox responded,\n\nI do feel there is a preoccupation with that. The preoccupation with transition and surgery objectifies trans people. And then we don't get to really deal with the real lived experiences. The reality of trans people's lives is that so often we are targets of violence. We experience discrimination disproportionately to the rest of the community. Our unemployment rate is twice the national average; if you are a trans person of color, that rate is four times the national average. The homicide rate is highest among trans women. If we focus on transition, we don't actually get to talk about those things.[37]\nNews outlets such as Salon, The Huffington Post, and Business Insider covered what was characterized by Salon writer Katie McDonough as Couric's \"clueless\" and \"invasive\" line of questioning.[38]\nCox was on the cover of the June 9, 2014, issue of Time and was interviewed for the article \"The Transgender Tipping Point\" by Katy Steinmetz, which ran in that issue and the title of which was also featured on the cover; this makes Cox the first openly transgender person on the cover of Time.[13][39][40]\nLater in 2014, Cox became the first openly transgender person to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in an acting category: Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Sophia Burset in Orange Is the New Black.[8][41][42] She also appeared in John Legend's video for the song \"You & I (Nobody in the World)\".[43]\nCox joined a campaign in 2014 against a Phoenix, Arizona law which allows police to arrest anyone suspected of \"manifesting prostitution,\" and which she feels targets transgender women of color, following the conviction of activist (and transgender woman of color) Monica Jones.[44] Cox stated, \"All over the country, trans women are targeted simply for being who they are. Laws like this manifestation law really support systematically the idea that girls like me, girls like me and Monica, are less than [others] in this country.\"[44] Later that year the Sylvia Rivera Law Project released a video in which Cox read a letter from transgender inmate Synthia China Blast, addressing common issues faced by trans inmates.[45] But when Cox learned that Blast was found guilty of the 1993 rape and murder of 13-year-old Ebony Williams, she wrote on her Tumblr, \"I was not aware of the charges for which she was convicted. If I had been aware of those charges, I would have never agreed to read the letter.\"[45]\nCox was featured in the annual \"Rebels\" issue of V in late 2014.[46] For the issue, V asked celebrities and artists to nominate who they saw as their personal rebels, and Natasha Lyonne nominated Cox.[46] Cox was also on the cover of the October 2014 issue of Essence magazine, along with actresses Alfre Woodard, Nicole Beharie, and Danai Gurira.[47]\nOn October 17, 2014, Laverne Cox Presents: The T Word, an hour-long documentary executive-produced and narrated by Cox, premiered on MTV and Logo simultaneously.[48] That same year, Cox was featured on the fifth anniversary cover of C\u2606NDY magazine along with 13 other transgender women \u2013 Janet Mock, Carmen Carrera, Geena Rocero, Isis King, Gisele Alicea, Leyna Ramous, Dina Marie, Nina Poon, Juliana Huxtable, Niki M'nray, P\u00eache Di, Carmen Xtravaganza (House of Xtravaganza), and Yasmine Petty.[49]\nIn 2015, Cox won a Daytime Emmy Award in Outstanding Special Class Special as Executive Producer for Laverne Cox Presents: The T Word.[9][10] This made Cox the first openly transgender woman to win a Daytime Emmy as an Executive Producer; as well, The T Word is the first trans documentary to win a Daytime Emmy.[9] That year Cox, among others, posed nude for the Allure annual \"Nudes\" issue, becoming the first openly transgender actress to do so.[50]\nCox is the cover subject for the June 11, 2015 \"totally not-straight issue\" of Entertainment Weekly, the first issue of the magazine in 15 years to focus exclusively on gay, lesbian, and transgender entertainment.[51]\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Cox and others told the stories of the people killed there.[52][53]\n\n Cox at L.A.'s Families Belong Together March in June 2018\nIn 2017, Cox began her role as transgender attorney Cameron Wirth on Doubt on CBS.[11] However, after only two episodes had aired, CBS announced that they were pulling the series from their schedule, leaving the future of the remaining unaired episodes uncertain.[54] It was the first official cancellation of the 2016\u201317 season, following weak viewership. CBS later announced that the remaining 11 episodes would be broadcast on Saturday, beginning July 1.[55]\nCox was nominated in 2017 for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her role in Orange Is the New Black.[56]\nAlso in 2017, Cox collaborated with the ACLU, Zackary Drucker, Molly Crabapple, and Kim Boekbinder, in making a video about transgender history and resistance, called \"Time Marches Forward & So Do We\", which Cox narrated.[57] That year Cox became one of the four faces of the fall campaign for the Ivy Park line of clothing.[58]\nCox was featured in Taylor Swift's \"You Need to Calm Down\" music video, which was released June 17, 2019.[59]\nShe was one of fifteen women chosen by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex to appear on the cover of the September 2019 issue of British Vogue; this made Cox the first openly transgender woman to appear on the cover of British Vogue.[60][61][62]\nIn September 2019, Cox brought ACLU attorney Chase Strangio as her date to the 2019 Emmy Awards, and carried a custom rainbow clutch featuring the phrases \"Oct 8\", \"Title VII\", and \"Supreme Court\". This action was in reference to the U.S. Supreme Court case R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in which Strangio was one of the lawyers representing Aimee Stephens, a trans woman who was fired from her job at a funeral home. Cox and Strangio spoke to reporters on the red carpet about the upcoming court case.[63][64][65] Cox executive produced the documentary Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen, which premiered on Netflix on January 27, 2020.[66][67]\n\nImpact[edit]\nLaverne Cox has been noted by her LGBT peers, and many others, for being a trailblazer for the transgender community,[68] and has won numerous awards for her activist approach in spreading awareness. Her impact and prominence in the media has led to a growing conversation about transgender culture,[69] specifically transgender women, and how being transgender intersects with one's race.[70] She is the first openly transgender person to be on the cover of Time magazine,[6] be nominated for a Primetime Emmy,[42] and have a wax work in Madame Tussauds,[16] as well as the first openly transgender woman to win a Daytime Emmy as an Executive Producer.[71] In May 2016, Cox was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from The New School in New York City for her progressive work in the fight for gender equality.[72]\n\nHonors and awards[edit]\n2013 \u2013 Anti-Violence Project 2013 Courage Award honoree[73]\n2013 \u2013 Reader's Choice Award at Out Magazine's OUT100 Gala, honoring the magazine's selection of 2013's 100 \"most compelling people of the year.\"[74]\n2014 \u2013 Woman of the Year by Glamour magazine.[75][76]\n2014 \u2013 Included in the annual Root 100; this list honors \"standout black leaders, innovators and culture shapers\" aged 45 and younger.[77]\n2014 \u2013 Topped the British newspaper The Guardian's third annual World Pride Power List, which ranks the world's most influential LGBT people.[78]\n2014 \u2013 Stephen F.

Wilder Foundation. He also worked as Senior Policy Aide and Advisor for Education, Youth Success, Racial Equity, and LGBTQ Rights for the Office of the Mayor of Minneapolis.[10]\nOn July 10, 2015, when same-sex marriage was legalized, Cunningham married Lane Cunningham, who is an IT professional at the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities .[12] They met at the Victory 44, a popular restaurant until its closing in 2017.[13]\nOn November 7, 2017, Cunningham became the second of three openly trans men to be elected to public office in the United States. Jay Irwin was elected to the Ralston School Board in Nebraska the year prior.[14] Tyler Titus was elected to the Erie School Board in Pennsylvania the same year as Cunningham. Cunningham and Andrea Jenkins (both on the Minneapolis City Council) are the first openly trans people of color to be elected to a city council anywhere in the United States.[2]\nWard 4 sits includes the northwest corner of Minneapolis, above Lowry Avenue and below 53rd Avenue North. Xerxes Avenue provides its western border; the Mississippi River marks the east. The City of Minneapolis Department of Community Planning & Economic Development shows that it is rich in diversity with 57 percent people of color or indigenous residents.[15]\n\nControversies[edit]\nIn November 2018 Cunningham drew attention for a Twitter tweet that disparaged opponents of the \"Minneapolis 2040\" plan as merely seeking to protect their \"bungalow neighborhoods.\"[16]\nCunningham is one of three Minneapolis City Council members who voted to dismantle the city's police department and afterwards started using private security for protection, out of public funds.[17]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Phillippe Cunningham Wins Ward 4, Now 2 Transgender Members Of Minneapolis City Council\".

Penner self-identified as transsexual in a 2007 column; soon afterward he returned from a vacation writing with the name Christine Daniels. In 2008, he resumed his male identity and name, and in 2009, he died by suicide.[2][3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Professional career\n\n2.1 Transsexuality\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 See also\n5 Notes and references\n6 Further reading\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn in Inglewood, California, Penner graduated from Western High School in Anaheim and from California State University, Fullerton.[2]\n\nProfessional career[edit]\nPenner began his journalism career at the Anaheim Bulletin as a writer and sports editor.[2]  He then joined the Los Angeles Times in 1983 as a staff writer for the paper's Orange County edition. Initially reporting on high school sports, Penner went on to cover a variety of national and international sporting events, including the Olympics, Major League Baseball, tennis, and World Cup soccer.[2]\n\nTranssexuality[edit]\nLater in his career, in addition to covering sports, Penner began writing about transsexual identity and the process of gender transition from an autobiographical perspective. The first such piece he wrote for the Times was an essay entitled \"Old Mike, New Christine\", which appeared in the paper in April 2007. In it, he wrote about his lifelong struggle to come to terms with his transsexuality:\n\nI am a transsexual sportswriter. It has taken more than 40 years, a million tears and hundreds of hours of soul-wrenching therapy for me to work up the courage to type those words. ... When you reach the point when one gender causes heartache and unbearable discomfort, and the other brings more joy and fulfillment than you ever imagined possible, it shouldn't take two tons of bricks to fall in order to know what to do.[4]\nPenner lived and wrote as Christine Daniels for more than a year, continuing to document his own experience with gender transition in the LA Times' blog \"Woman in Progress\". Daniels' writing became a source of hope for people across the country with gender-identity issues.[5]\nPenner wrote as Christine Daniels from July 2007 until about March 2008;  without elaboration, he resumed using Mike Penner as his byline in October 2008.[6]\nPenner was a member of the Times' sports staff at the time of his death.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nPenner was at one time married to fellow Los Angeles Times sportswriter Lisa Dillman[7] although at the time of his death they were divorced.[2]\nPenner was found dead in his Los Angeles home on November 28, 2009, of an apparent suicide.[2]  The coroner's report determined that he died of carbon monoxide poisoning after running a hose from his car's exhaust pipe into the car while it ran in his apartment building's subterranean garage.[8]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of transgender people\nNotes and references[edit]\n\n^ A writer's transformation makes the personal public Los Angeles Times, April 27, 2007\n\n^ a b c d e f Mike Penner dies at 52; Los Angeles Times sportswriter Los Angeles Times, November 29, 2009\n\n^ \"21 Transgender People Who Influenced American Culture\".

Her role in the widely successful Los Rold\u00e1n gave her international notoriety. Over the years, Trinidad has become a household name in Argentine show business.\nIn 2014, GLAAD stated that \"through her advocacy and proud visibility, [she] has contributed immensely to advancing the equality movement around the world and particularly in Argentina.\"[1] She became the first transgender person in Argentina to get her name and the gender on her government-issued ID legally changed without pathologizing her gender identity,[1][2] two years before the national Gender Identity Law was established.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life\n1.2 Education\n1.3 Career Summary\n1.4 Gender controversy\n\n\n2 Notes\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nEarly life[edit]\nFlorencia  was born in the city of Monte Grande, Buenos Aires Province. The family home was located in Villa Los Lirios. When De La V was two years old, her mother died,[a] and she moved to Lomas de Zamora (Province of Buenos Aires) with her father and brother.\nAt age 16 Florencia dressed-up as a young lady to attend the sweet 16th birthday party of her best friend. From then on she became known as Karen until one day she was renamed by a boyfriend as \u201cFlorencia de la Vega\u201d; eventually for legal reasons her name was adapted to Florencia de la V.\n\nEducation[edit]\nShe completed her primary and high-school in the suburbs of Lomas de Zamora, located in the southwest part of greater Buenos Aires.\nA fashion enthusiast since she made her first dress, she decided to follow a career in fashion design at the UNNE, the National University of the Northeast, Argentina. As Karen, she began her career producing out-fits and theatrical garments for Burlesque and Musical productions, until one day she met the main character of a show, a trans woman named Cris Mir\u00f3 (n\u00e9e Gerardo El\u00edas Virguez). At that moment Florencia de la V became a media trans woman taking the main step into a mega-career in show business.\nSince then on, she was godfathered by one of the main Argentinean lords of show-business, Gerardo Sofovich, who guided Florencia to national stardom.\n\nCareer Summary[edit]\nFlorencia de La V began cross-dressing at the age of 16. She enrolled in a university in fashion design, and later took jobs as a designer and promoter.\nShe also worked at the popular Buenos Aires club \"Tabaris\", replacing Cris Mir\u00f3, a well known transvestite, in the show. It was while working there that she became a vedette, catching the eyes of television and theater producer Gerardo Sofovich.\nShe made her acting debut in the TV show Pol\u00e9mica en el Bar (\"Controversy at the Bar\").\nDe La V subsequently played small roles in many telenovelas and variety shows for Argentina's Telefe, but the show that made her an internationally known star has arguably been Los Rold\u00e1n (2004), a sitcom that became a hit across South America and among digital television viewers in the United States. In Los Rold\u00e1n, she played as \"Raul Rold\u00e1n\", a transvestite who goes under the name \"Laiza Rold\u00e1n\" when dressed as a woman. She is currently the hostess of the  semi-acted comedy and gossip show called \"La Pelu\", with Gladys Florimonte.[6]\nFlorencia de La V expressed that she felt a little uncomfortable at first with being given a job as a transvestite in the soap opera. Later on, however, she accepted the fact that her character shares some life characteristics with her, which made her more comfortable about playing \"Laiza Rold\u00e1n\".[citation needed] She has said, however, that for her next roles, she would prefer to play a woman. After Los Rold\u00e1n ended, Florencia De La V worked in Mar Del Plata.\nIn 1998 she met her partner, dentist Pablo Goycochea, whom she married on 1 November 2011 in Buenos Aires. She has two children, twins, a boy and girl.[7]\n\nGender controversy[edit]\nDuring August 2014, well-known Argentine reporter Jorge Lanata declared that De La V was not a woman but a transsexual. Actor Dario Grandinetti made a public comment on a Buenos Aires radio station supporting De La V and Lanata threatened Grandinetti with a perjury lawsuit.[8]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ De La V has publicly stated both that her mother died from cancer[4] and that her mother died from complications from an abortion.[5]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Murray, Ross (4 April 2014). \"GLAAD Global Voices: This transgender star paved the way for Argentinians like her\".

(February 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\nMichelle Dumaresq is a Canadian professional downhill mountain bike competitor and post-operative trans woman. She competes with other professional female downhill mountain bike racers. She entered the sport in 2001, six years after completing gender reassignment surgery, when she was discovered riding on Vancouver's North Shore by several top women mountain bikers.  Dumaresq is quite open about gender identity.\n\nGender Identity[edit]\nDumaresq had gender confirmation surgery performed in 1996, after receiving hormonal therapy for a considerable time.\nSince 2004, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), whose rules are used commonly throughout competitive sport, has allowed transgender individuals to compete in the division which matches their gender identity as long as the individual has had a blood testosterone level not exceeding 10 nmol/L for at least the preceding 12 months. In Dumaresq's case, she had undergone a gonadectomy six years prior to beginning competition and had been on hormones for well over six years.\n\nCompetitive career[edit]\nThe first event Dumaresq entered was the Bear Mountain race held in Mission, BC in May 2001. She entered the novice female class and won. In fact, her finish time was 2.5 seconds faster than the winner of the female professional category.  After racing two more races, her license was suspended by Cycling BC due to complaints from female competitors.\nCycling BC and the Canadian Cycling Association met privately with local organizers and at first suggested that Dumaresq quit racing.  After discussion with the UCI the decision was made to permit Dumaresq to continue competing in the women's category.  Dumaresq was not permitted to compete in the men's category since she is a woman legally and medically in addition to psychologically.\nIn April 2002, she was awarded a license to race in the women's category. Three weeks later, she entered her first race in the pro women's class and finished 3rd.  The following week she placed 1st, beating her competition by 10 seconds. A wave of protest ensued and a petition was created and signed by female (and a few male) racers, asking for Dumaresq to be disqualified. Because she had a race license, the request was denied and her first professional win with females was upheld.\nDumaresq went on to win the 2002 Canada Cup series, which qualified her for the Canadian National team.\nLater on, in September 2002, she co-represented Canada at the World Mountain Bike Championships. However, due to technical issues with her bike, Dumaresq only managed a 24th-place finish in the event.\nIn 2003, Dumaresq won the 2003 Canadian National Championships and again represented Canada in the 2003 World Championships. She repeated her Nationals win in 2004 and finished 17th at the 2004 World Mountain Bike Championships held in Les Gets, France.\nAt the 2006 Canadian Nationals, a protest from one of her competitors during the podium ceremonies brought renewed attention to Dumaresq's participation in female sports. The boyfriend of second-place finisher Danika Schroeter jumped up onto the podium and helped Schroeter put on a T-shirt reading '100% Pure Woman Champ'.\nThe Canadian Cycling Association suspended Schroeter for her actions.  However, in a controversial move, the CCA announced that Schroeter's time off the race course would be served during the off-season when it would have no impact on her.\n\nSee also[edit]\nMountain Biking\nMountain bikes\nWorld Mountain Bike Championship\nUnion Cycliste Internationale\nSexual dimorphism\nTranssexualism\n\n\n\n"}, {"Name": "Amazon Eve", "Gender identity": "Woman", "isTrans": true, "text": "\n\nAmazon EveErvin in 2012BornWilliam Ervin (1979-02-23) February 23, 1979 (age\u00a041)Turlock, California, U.S.OccupationModelfitness traineractressYears\u00a0active2011\u2013presentModeling informationHeight6\u00a0ft 8\u00a03\u20444\u00a0in (2.05\u00a0m)[1]Hair colorRed[1]Eye colorHazel[2]AgencyArtist International[2]\nWebsitewww.amazoneve.com\nErika Ervin (born February 23, 1979[3][1]), known professionally as Amazon Eve, is an American model, fitness trainer, and actress.

Tired of the office life that she had pursued and unhappy with her weight, she joined a gym but strove for an unrealistic size 0 physique that almost resulted in ending her life.[11] Eventually she developed a healthier body image and began to view herself as a super-sized version of Super Woman and became a personal trainer devoted to instilling realistic expectations for herself and her clients. She tours the world participating in height comparison photo shoots and regular modeling jobs and posts her tour on her website.\nIn 2011 she was crowned the World's Tallest Professional Model by Guinness World Records.[13]\n\nAppearances[edit]\nIn the September 2013 issue of Harper's Bazaar, Carine Roitfeld, former editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris, wrote an article, \"Carine Roitfeld's 'Singular Beauties'\", with photographs by Karl Lagerfeld.[14] The article includes 25 models and is \"an homage to the diversity of women\". Among the models are Scarlett Johansson, Carmen Dell'Orefice (82 years old), Gabourey Sidibe, and Ervin who is paired with 5'9\" Xiao Wen. There is also a video about the making of the article in which Xiao Wen and Ervin appear.[15]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nErvin underwent sex reassignment surgery in 2004.[3] In interviews Ervin has talked about the problems of being a tall woman. Other topics she has addressed include her troubles growing up dealing with teasing in high school, family problems and her modeling experience.[10][16]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\nNotes\n\n\n2011\nGoogle Maps is Watching You\n\nN/A\n\nShort film\n\n\n2017\nWhitney's Wedding\n\nN/A\n\nShort film\n\n\n2017\nFalling South\n\nN/A\n\nShort film\n\n\n2018\nChimera\n\nDita Gruze\n\n\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\nNotes\n\n\n2013\n\nFamily Tools\n\nTall Client Lady\n\nEpisode: \"Pilot\"\n\n\n2013\n\nHemlock Grove\n\nShelley Godfrey\n\n5 episodes\n\n\n2014\u20132015\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Freak Show\n\nAmazon Eve\n\n13 episodes\n\n\n2018\n\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nLady Karaba\n\nEpisode: \"Fun & Games\"\n\n\n2018\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse\n\nThe Fist\n\n3 episodes\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e \"Hoffman:At nearly 6 feet 9, Ervin stands tall\".

Fragility, purity, and decay are important subjects in my work. Nature is also a noteworthy aspect of my work as well.\"\n\u00a0\u2014Florian-Ayala Fauna[16]\n\n\nFauna is a multidisciplinary artist whose work has been exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, France, a Coil-themed exhibition in Berlin, Germany, and in the United Kingdom as well as locally in Buffalo, New York.[18][16][3][19][20] Fauna's artwork utilizes collage, film, painting, photography, and poetry.[3][4] Her work includes  occult, psychedelia, chaos and spiritual enlightenment.[21] Animal imagery include deer, foxes, goats, hares, birds, and wolves.[3][12] She cites the Surrealists as an influence.[5][15][17]\n\nMusic[edit]\nuncertain[edit]\nIn 2007, uncertain began as the solo project of Florian-Ayala Fauna.[12][15][17][6][7][8][9] Initially, she made ambient and drone music with the computer programme Ableton.[17] Her first album glass fawn was an ambient soundscape about a deer getting lost.[5] It often involved field recordings, processed sounds, and tape loops while their current cycle (since 2012) features albums about a family of foxes done with composition, sampling, and complex music production on Ableton Live and Kontakt.[5][3][4] Influences include Aleister Crowley, Hermeticism, Arvo P\u00e4rt, Coil, Current 93, Throbbing Gristle, and alchemy.[5][17][6][7][8][9][10][11] As of 2016, Fauna is the main producer and collaborates with others, primarily with Felix Keigh who is her fianc\u00e9 and main vocalist.[4][17][15]\n\nLive performances[edit]\nuncertain started doing live performances in 2013.[17] Cities for live performances have included Boston, Cincinnati, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. However, her chronic fatigue limits touring.[5][15] They use visuals such as the use of animal masks, candles, lights, video projections, and ritualistic costumes.[17] Live shows have included performances alongside TRNSGNDR/VHS.[5]\n\nCollaborations[edit]\nFauna has collaborated with former Coil member Stephen Thrower (Cyclobe, UnicaZ\u00fcrn), Esperik Glare's Charlie Martineau (In Serpents and Seas), and others.[5][14] Thrower contributed an opening track to her 2016 album Dark Night of the Soul.[12] She has also frequently done artwork for Swiss post-industrial musicians and artists Black Sun Productions. Her most recent collaboration was with London-based industrial hip hop artist Ubik MCDXCII, providing production work for the track \"Rites and Ceremonies\" on his album \"Blackout Blinds\".[citation needed]\n\nReception[edit]\nIn February 2013, Orange County, California alternative weekly OC Weekly's Dave Barton called dancing with the blind (lost children) \"atmospheric and haunting\" and \"one of the most evocative titles for an album I've ever heard.\"[3] In August 2016, The Public's Cory Perla described both her art and music as \"otherworldly.\"[4] In March 2017, British music magazine The Quietus's Russell Cuzner summed up her music as \"somehow fulfil[s] a similar aesthetic to the artist's equally prolific visual art that often depict animal heads [...] as if charged with some kind of hidden power, part gothic horror, part Gnostic totem.\"[12] In December 2019, Columbus Alive's Andy Downing said God Is a Man Eater was \"dense, buzzing, six-track song cycle.\"[15]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nFauna supports anti-fascism and identifies as an anarchist.[5][17]\n\nDiscography[edit]\n\n\nTitle\nRelease\nRecord label (Catalogue number)\n\n\n\n\n\nglass fawn\n2009[5] or 11 January 2010[22]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nsmall cold hands\n6 April 2010[24]\nN/A[23]\n\n\namniotic fluid EP\n20 February 2011[25]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1][23]\n\n\nseahorse (abyssopelagic)\n23 February 2011[26]\nN/A[23]\n\n\ngrief: silence in five movements\n23 May 2011[27][28]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1][23] (spar004[1][27])\n\n\n\u00e6ther: musick for moths\n1 January 2012[29][30]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nphoenix rising EP\n1 February 2012[31]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nWarm Leatherette (a cover version of The Normal)\n9 April 2012[32][33]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1][23]\n\n\nvery friendly (a cover version of Throbbing Gristle)\n23 April 2012[34]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1]\n\n\nnocturnal\n1 May 2012[35][36]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1][23]\n\n\ndancing with the blind (lost children)\n1 January 2013[37][38]\nSparrow's Tongue Records (spar008[38])[3][1][23]\n\n\nphantoms of the trench warfare (past lives in black flames)\n20 March 2013[39]\nSparrow's Tongue Records (spar009[39])[23]\n\n\ncrawling through the abyss (perdurabo)\n23 October 2013[40]\nSparrow's Tongue Records (spar010[40])[23]\n\n\nthe cycle of tears (moon)\n23 September 2014[41]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nuncertain presents \u2021 black-stag's-lament \u2021 - the vision of sorrow ep\n10 December 2014[42]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nHorns and Teeth (Blood Rite)\n16 January 2015[43]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nBlack Forest Invocation (Astaroth) - Live at Black Forest Invocation\n22 February 2015[44]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nThe Fox's Blood Moon (for Ian Johnstone)\n23 July 2015[45]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nThe Price of Existence Is Eternal Warfare (Live Invocations)\n31 October 2015[46]\nWraith Productions (886445526660[46])[23]\n\n\ntransnoise aktion no. 001 - 05.21.2016\n2016\nN/A\n\n\nThe Veins were Licked by the Vulpine Garden\n5 June 2016[47]\nN/A[23]\n\n\ntransnoise aktion no. 003 - 08.04.2016\n2016\nN/A\n\n\ntransnoise aktion no. 004 - 08.26.2016\n2016\nN/A\n\n\nTransnoise Aktion no. 005 - 09.02.2016\n4 September 2016[48]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nThe Crown of the Mother Elk\n26 September 2016[49]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nblack stag's lament\n3 December 2016[50]\nN/A[23]\n\n\ndark night of the soul (the pile of bodies)\n22 December 2016[51]\nN/A[12][23]\n\n\nThe Surgeon Was a Butcher\n5 July 2017[52]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nChild Covered in Needles (She Is Dancing and Blind)\n5 August 2017[53]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nGod Is a Man Eater[15]\n30 October 2019[54]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of ambient music artists\nList of androgynous people\nList of dark ambient artists\nList of experimental musicians\nList of noise musicians\nList of people from Buffalo, New York\nList of people from Hampton Roads, Virginia\nList of people from Virginia\nList of people with chronic fatigue syndrome\nList of transgender people\nList of intersex people\nBiography portalArts portalMusic portalLGBT portal\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j \"Florian-Ayala Fauna Discography at Discogs\".

Due to the presence of an intersex condition at birth, he was christened Elizabeth Forbes-Sempill, and officially registered as the youngest daughter of John, Lord Sempill. After an uncomfortable upbringing, he began living as a man at the start of his medical career in 1945. He formally re-registered his birth as male in 1952, adopting the name of \"Ewan Forbes-Sempill\", and was married a month later.\nIn 1965, he stood to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, together with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable to be considered in other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.\n\nContents\n\n1 Family background\n2 Early life\n3 Medical career\n4 Inheritance and lawsuit\n5 Later life\n6 Notes\n7 References\n\n\nFamily background[edit]\n Craigievar Castle, principal seat of the Forbes family\nThe Forbeses were a well-established Aberdeenshire family, holders of both a barony and a baronetcy. The baronetcy had been bestowed in 1630, and was restricted to heirs male.[1] In 1884 Sir William Forbes, the eighth baronet, inherited his cousin Maria's title as Lord Sempill and took the surname of Forbes-Sempill.[2] On William's death in 1905, both titles passed to his eldest son, John.[1]\nJohn, the new Lord Sempill and Baronet, was a landowner and soldier who had served with the Lovat Scouts and then the Black Watch in the South African War. He would later command the 8th Battalion of the Black Watch during the First World War, in which he was wounded at the Battle of Loos.[3] During the 1880s, he had met Gwendolyn Prodger at the fashionable German resort of Bad Homburg; the couple were married on 22 June 1892.[4] The bride, from a Cornish background, had been brought up in Wales and was an accomplished harpist.[3]\nThe couple had four children. The eldest, William, was born in 1893, shortly after their marriage. William later became an engineer, aviator, and spy. There were then two daughters; Gwendolyn[1] (also known as Gwyneth), who died of appendicitis before Ewan's birth, and Margaret, who later became a decorated member of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in the Second World War and a Justice of the Peace, before dying in a car accident in 1966.[1]\nFinally, in 1912, a fourth child was born, christened Elizabeth Forbes-Sempill, and known to the family as \"Betty\".[5]\n\nEarly life[edit]\nThe issue of Ewan's gender would later prove contentious; the birth registration recorded a female child, but Forbes later commented that this was \"a ghastly mistake\".[6] Ewan was brought up as a girl alongside Margaret, but found childhood to be dominated by a growing gender insecurity.[5] They spent a large amount of time playing with their cousins Patrick and David,[7] and in many contemporary photographs Forbes can be seen dressed in trousers and a male jacket, unconventional dress for a young woman of that era.[8] In his book The Aul' Days, written many years later, Forbes recalled a hatred of being \"made to dress up\" for social engagements, and of going to great lengths to avoid them.[7]\nLord Sempill insisted on a \"strict Scottish\" upbringing for his children, which meant that they were taught to speak and write fluently in Doric as well as various European languages.[9] Forbes refused to go away to a girls' school, which meant being educated at home;[5] at fifteen, he pressed to be allowed to go overseas to attend a pre-university course, and eventually settled on a co-educational institution in Dresden.[10] After coming out as a debutante in London in the late 1920s,[5] Forbes studied in Dresden for a year, 1929\u20131930, before travelling through central Europe, visiting Prague and Vienna.[11] In the following academic year, he continued his studies in Paris, where he attended lectures at the Sorbonne and studied the harp under the principal harpist of the Paris Op\u00e9ra.[12]\nAs well as the harp, Forbes was an accomplished public reciter; in the summer of 1930, he won the Scots Verse recital contest at the Aberdeen Music Festival, and was paid by Beltona to make a series of recordings of the poems of Charles Murray.[5] After returning from Paris, he led a troupe of Scottish country dancers \u2013 the \"Dancers of Don\",[5] that he had formed together with Isabella Mitchell.[6] By this time, Forbes's heart was set on studying medicine. However, his father refused to fund his studies, arguing that since there was more than enough work to be done managing the estate, there was no need for him to study further. Ewan resolved to fund his own studies, aiming to put aside \u00a31,000 to cover the costs.[13] In 1933, he studied under the psychologist Leonhard Seif in Munich, living with the British novelist Phyllis Bottome. Whilst there, he witnessed the German elections which brought the Nazi Party into power, and heard Adolf Hitler speak.[13]\nOn the death of Lord Sempill in 1934, both the barony and the baronetcy passed to William, the eldest child. Forbes inherited an estate at Brux Castle, Aberdeenshire,[14] of about 1,300 acres (5.3\u00a0km2),[6] and took to the lifestyle of a laird with gusto, adopting a broad Doric accent and taking to wearing a masculine kilt.[5]\n\nMedical career[edit]\nIn 1939, Forbes was accepted as a medical student at the University of Aberdeen. He graduated in 1944 and took up the post of Junior Casualty Officer at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.[15] After a swift progression to Senior Casualty Officer, he began to work as a general practitioner in Alford, Aberdeenshire in 1945.[16] In addition to the normal work of a rural doctor, in 1946 Forbes was called upon to act as a medical officer for a large number of German prisoners of war who were held in the area, due to his command of the language.[17]\nThe Alford area was one of the largest medical practices in Great Britain, and in the winter months Forbes often had to travel through ten-foot snowdrifts in a converted Universal Carrier.[5] These conditions were not entirely unfamiliar; a trip to see an uncle in St. Moritz at the age of thirteen had led to him taking up skiing and figure-skating and winning a number of bob sled races.[10] He did not live in Alford, but remained at Brux, appointing a medical assistant to live in the town. The estate, left in the hands of a small resident staff, quickly ran into financial troubles.[14] To raise a large amount of money quickly, Forbes sold the practice in Alford and returned to the farm in 1952, running it directly as a going concern from then on.[18]\nOn moving to Alford, Forbes had begun publicly to present as a man. In 1952, he formally became male by the simple process of requesting a warrant for birth re-registration from the Sheriff of Aberdeen, registering himself as male, and changing his name to Ewan Forbes-Sempill.[5] He announced this with a notice in the Aberdeen Press and Journal of 12 September 1952: \"Dr E. Forbes-Sempill henceforth wishes to be known as Dr Ewan Forbes-Sempill\". His plans had been known in advance to many of his patients, who were reported as universally supportive.[5] Forbes was equally candid with the press, describing the situation to one reporter as \"...a ghastly mistake. I was carelessly registered as a girl in the first place, but of course, that was forty years ago ... the doctors in those days were mistaken, too  ... I have been sacrificed to prudery, and the horror which our parents had about sex\".[6]\nA month later, on 10 October, he married Isabella Mitchell, his housekeeper for the past five years, and formerly co-founder of his dance troupe.[19] The marriage took place at the kirk in Kildrummy, which he had recently joined.[20]\n\nInheritance and lawsuit[edit]\nThe re-registration passed without much public comment, and the issue of his gender would remain a private one until 1965. That December, his elder brother died, leaving daughters but no sons, and thus posing a problem of inheritance. The barony could be inherited by heirs male or female, and so passed directly to Sempill's eldest daughter Ann, but the baronetcy \u2013 along with the bulk of the land \u2013 would have to pass to the first male heir. The family had assumed that Ewan would inherit, as the younger brother. Following the death of the Lord Sempill in December 1965, The Times cited Debrett's in reporting that the heir to the baronetcy was the Hon. Ewan Forbes-Sempill, \"formerly registered as Elizabeth\".[21] However, this was challenged by his cousin John Forbes-Sempill,[22] who argued that the 1952 re-registration was invalid. This would mean that Forbes was still legally considered a woman, unable to inherit the title, and so it would pass to John Forbes-Sempill.[5]\nAt the time, gender re-registration was permitted in a limited set of cases; the leading case, decided in 1965, had held that re-registration of this form was only permitted when \"the sex of a child was indeterminate at birth and it was later discovered ... that an error had been made\". The challenge was taken to the Court of Session, where the case was heard in great secrecy \u2013 no papers were publicly filed, and the judge sat in a solicitor's office rather than in open court to hear the case.[23] However, the records of the case were made available via the National Archives of Scotland in 1991, with additional documents released in 1994.[24][25] They show that a total of twelve medical experts were called to give evidence,[24] and their testimony was taken by the court to indicate that Forbes was a physical hermaphrodite, which would accord with the legal requirement of \"indeterminate at birth\". However, the medical evidence was not conclusive; Professor Martin Roth observed in evidence that he felt Forbes' condition was closer to that of a transsexual, and Professor John Strong described the medical tests involved as \"not wholly conclusive\".[26] The judge ruled in favour of Forbes, though it has been suggested that the judge desired to ensure the estate and the title was inherited by the \"right\" candidate, and was flexible with his judgement to obtain this result.[27] The ruling was appealed to the Lord Advocate, who referred the matter to the Home Secretary, James Callaghan. Callaghan finally ruled in December 1968 that Forbes was the rightful holder of the title, confirming the court's decision.[5]\nThe level of secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some contemporary observers, meant that it was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were not known for some time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett [1970], it was not able to be considered as precedent in later judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance.[23]\n\nLater life[edit]\nOn taking up the baronetcy, Forbes dropped the \"Sempill\" from his surname; this had been adopted by the family in the 1880s when they inherited the barony, and there was no reason to persist once the titles were separated.[14]\nWith the inheritance case settled, he left the public eye and returned to the life of a rural landowner, continuing to live in his house at Brux.[14] Forbes was an elder of the local kirk at Kildrummy,[20] and was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Aberdeenshire in 1969.[16] He published a book of reminiscences of his early years in 1984, The Aul' Days.\nForbes died in 1991, leaving no children, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his cousin John, the man who had originally mounted the legal challenge in the 1960s.[5] His widow, Isabella, survived him, dying in 2002.[19]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d Burke's, p. 1082\n\n^ \"Obituary of William Forbes-Sempill\".

He was in 1917\u201318 one of the first trans men to undergo hysterectomy in the United States, and lived the rest of his life as a man.[1] He pioneered the use of x-ray photography in tuberculosis detection and helped implement TB screening programs that saved thousands of lives.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Transition\n3 Life after transition\n4 Tuberculosis research\n5 Fiction writing\n\n5.1 Early short stories\n5.2 Novels\n\n\n6 Legacy\n7 Controversy\n8 Additional media\n\n8.1 Exhibitions\n8.2 Describing Hart as transsexual/transgender\n8.3 Describing Hart as lesbian\n8.4 General works\n\n\n9 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\n Alan Hart as a baby.\nHart was born October 4, 1890, in Halls Summit, Coffey County, Kansas, to Albert L. Hart and Edna Hart (n\u00e9e Bamford). When his father died of typhoid fever in 1892, his mother reverted to her maiden name and moved the family to Linn County, Oregon.[1] When Hart was five years old his mother remarried, to Bill Barton, and the family moved to Edna's father's farm.[1] Hart wrote later, in 1911, of his happiness during this time, when he was free to present as male, playing with boys' toys made for him by his grandfather. His parents and grandparents largely accepted and supported his gender expression, though his mother described his \"desire to be a boy\" as \"foolish.\" His grandparents' obituaries, from 1921 and 1924, both list Hart as a grandson.[3] When Hart was 12 the family moved to Albany. There Hart was obliged to present as female to attend school, where he was treated as a girl. He continued to spend the holidays at his grandfather's farm, presenting as male among his male friends, \"teasing the girls and playing boy's games\".[4] According to a reminiscence piece in the Halls Summit News of June 10, 1921, \"Young Hart was different, even then. Boys' clothes just felt natural. Hart always regarded himself as a boy and begged his family to cut his hair and let his wear trousers. Hart disliked dolls but enjoyed playing doctor. He hated traditional girl tasks, preferring farm work with the menfolk instead. The self reliance that became a lifelong trait was evident early: once when he accidentally chopped off his fingertip with an axe, Hart dressed it himself, saying nothing about it to the family.\"[5]\nAs a suppressed male during his school years, Hart was allowed to write essays under his chosen name \"Robert Allen Bamford, Jr.\" with little resistance from his classmates or teachers. It was common at the time for writers to use pseudonyms, including to assume names associated with the opposite gender. Hart published work in local newspapers and in school and college publications under this name, or as \"submitted by an anonymous boy\", or using the neutral \"A.L.H.\" or \"A. Hart\". He used his legal name only under pressure from peers or seniors. His early work dealt with masculine subjects, even when he was asked to write on topics about life as a woman. When asked to write about female classmates or friends he portrayed them as prize fighters or boyish basketball players.\n\n Hart (standing on right) as a part of editorial staff for college yearbook.\n Eva Cushman, Alan's college love.\nHart attended Albany College (now Lewis & Clark College), then transferred with classmate and romantic partner Eva Cushman to Stanford University for the 1911\u20131912 school year before going back to Albany.[6] Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now Oregon Health & Science University); during this period, Hart also returned to Northern California to attend courses in the summer of 1916 at the Stanford University School of Medicine, then located in San Francisco.[7] Hart was deeply unhappy that the medical degree was issued in his female name, limiting his opportunities to use it in any future life under a male name. College records show that at least one of the senior staff was sympathetic; his graduation records were indexed internally as \"Hart, Lucile (aka Robert L.), M.D.\".[8] Nonetheless, Hart knew that if he presented himself as Robert, any prospective employer checking his credentials  would discover the female name or find no records for him at all. After graduation he worked for a short while (presenting as a woman) at a Red Cross hospital in Philadelphia.\n\nTransition[edit]\nUpon reaching adulthood Hart sought psychiatric counselling and radical surgery to live as a man. Hart's was the first documented transgender male transition in the United States,[9][10] though sex reassignment surgeries had been carried out earlier in Germany,[11] including on one man, treated by German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld,[12] who had won the right to serve in the German military.[13]  The 1906/07 case of Karl M. Baer had set a new precedent for sex reassignment surgery by enlisting simultaneous support from psychiatric, legal, and surgical quarters. There was now medical and legal precedent for transitioning; Hart's approach to his own transition appears to have drawn on the Baer case.\nIn 1917, Hart approached Joshua Allen Gilbert, Ph.D., M.D., at the University of Oregon and requested surgery to eliminate menstruation and the possibility of ever becoming pregnant.[14] He also presented Gilbert with a eugenic argument, that a person with \"abnormal inversion\" should be sterilized.[1] Gilbert was initially reluctant, but accepted that Hart was \"extremely intelligent and not mentally ill, but afflicted with a mysterious disorder for which I [Gilbert] have no explanation.\" He accepted that Hart experienced himself only as a male, who described himself using phrases including \"the other fellows and I\" and asking \"what could a fellow do?\" Gilbert wrote, in case notes published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders in 1920, that \"from a sociological and psychological standpoint she [Hart] is a man\" and that living as one was Hart's only chance for a happy existence, \"the best that can be done.\"[1] He added, \"Let him who finds in himself a tendency to criticize to offer some constructive method of dealing with the problem on hand. He will not want for difficulties. The patient and I have done our best with it.\" \nEarly FTM surgeries involved the implanting of testicular tissue in place of the removed ovaries.[15] Crystalline male hormones had been extracted in usable quantities from male urine by 1903,[16] but it represented an infection risk. Synthetic hormones were not manufactured until 1920 (by Bayer),[17] and when given the opportunity, Hart underwent hormone therapy.[18]\nHart's surgery was completed at the University of Oregon Medical School[19] over the 1917\u20131918 winter vacation. He then legally changed his name.\nHe interned at San Francisco Hospital. A former classmate recognized him there, and he was outed as transgender in the Spokesman-Review newspaper on Feb. 6, 1918. The article's opening sentence referred to him by his birth name and with female pronouns, describing him as having graduated from Stanford \"as a fluffy coed...[who] affected boyish mannerisms.\"[20]\nIn February 1918 he married his first wife Inez Stark and moved with her to Gardiner, Oregon, to set up his own medical practice.\nIn an interview with a local paper, Hart declared that he was \"happier since I made this change than I ever have in my life, and I will continue this way as long as I live [...] I have never concealed anything regarding my [change] to men's clothing [...] I came home to show my friends that I am ashamed of nothing.\"[21]\n\nLife after transition[edit]\nIn Oregon, Hart suffered an early blow when a former medical school classmate outed him as transgender, forcing Hart and his wife to move.[1] Hart found the experience traumatic and again consulted Gilbert, who wrote that Hart had suffered from \"the hounding process ... which our modern social organization can carry on to such perfection and refinement.\"[22] Hart set up a new practice in remote Huntley, Montana, writing later that he \"did operations in barns and houses...('til) the crash of the autumn of 1920 wiped out most of the Montana farmers and stockmen, and me along with them\". He then took itinerant work, until in 1921, on a written recommendation from noted doctor Harriet J. Lawrence (decorated by President Wilson for developing a flu vaccine), he secured a post as staff physician at Albuquerque Sanatorium.\nThe relocations, financial insecurity, and secrecy placed strain on Hart's marriage, and Inez left him in September 1923. She ordered him to have no further contact with her, and divorced him in 1925.[1] The same year Hart married his second wife, Edna Ruddick; the union lasted until the end of Hart's life. In 1925 Hart moved to the Trudeau School of Tuberculosis in New York, where he also carried out postgraduate work; he spent 1926\u20131928 as a clinician at the Rockford TB sanatorium in Illinois. In 1928 Hart obtained a master's degree in Radiology from the University of Pennsylvania;[1] he was in 1929 appointed Director of Radiology at Tacoma General Hospital. During the 1930s the couple moved to Idaho, where Hart worked during the 1930s and early 1940s; his work also took him to Washington, where he held a research fellowship as a roentgenologist in Spokane. During the war Hart was also a medical adviser at the Army Recruiting and Induction headquarters in Seattle, while Edna worked for the King County Welfare Department in the same city.\nIn 1948, after Hart obtained a master's degree in public health from Yale, the couple moved to Connecticut, where Hart had been appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. The couple lived for the rest of their lives in West Hartford, Connecticut, where Edna became a professor at the University of Hartford. After the Second World War synthetic testosterone became available in the US, and for the first time Hart was able to grow a beard and shave. He also developed a deeper voice, making him more confident and his public appearances easier.[9]\nDuring the last six years of his life Hart gave numerous lectures, and dedicated all his free time to fundraising for medical research and to support patients with advanced TB who could not afford treatment. He was a member of the American Thoracic Society, American Public Health Association, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and American Civil Liberties Union, among many others. Socially, both he and Edna were well liked, active community leaders. Alan served for eight years as vice president for his local Unitarian Church council.\nHart died of heart failure on July 1, 1962. The terms of his will directed his body be cremated and his ashes scattered over Puget Sound where he and Edna had spent many happy summers together.\nHart said once,[when?] in a speech to graduating medical students, \"Each of us must take into account the raw material which heredity dealt us at birth and the opportunities we have had along the way, and then work out for ourselves a sensible evaluation of our personalities and accomplishments\".[23][24]\n\nTuberculosis research[edit]\nHart devoted much of his career to research into and treatment of tuberculosis. In the early 20th century the disease was the biggest killer in America. Doctors, including Hart, were realizing that myriad illnesses\u2014consumption, phthisis, phthisis pulmonalis, Koch's disease, scrofula, lupus vulgaris, white plague, King's evil, Pott's disease, and Gibbus\u2014were all in fact cases of tuberculosis (TB). TB usually attacked victims' lungs first; Hart was among the first physicians to document how it then spread, via the circulatory system, causing lesions on the kidneys, spine, and brain, eventually resulting in death. Scientists had discovered in the nineteenth century that tuberculosis was not hereditary, but an airborne bacillus spread rapidly among persons in close proximity by coughing and sneezing. This meant it might be treated, but with no cure for the disease in its advanced stages the only hope for sufferers was early detection.\nX-rays, or Roentgen rays as they were more commonly known until World War Two, had been discovered only in 1895, when Hart was five years old. In the early twentieth century they were used to detect bone fractures and tumors, but Hart became interested in their potential for detecting tuberculosis. Since the disease often presented no symptoms in its early stages, x-ray screening was invaluable for early detection. Even rudimentary early x-ray machines could detect the disease before it became critical. This allowed early treatment, often saving the patient's life. It also meant sufferers could be identified and isolated from the population, greatly lessening the spread of the disease. Public fund-raising drives, like the newly created Christmas Seal campaign, helped finance these efforts. By the time antibiotics were introduced in the 1940s, doctors using the techniques Hart developed had managed to cut the tuberculosis death toll down to one fiftieth.\nIn 1937 Hart was hired by the Idaho Tuberculosis Association and later became the state's Tuberculosis Control Officer. He established up Idaho's first fixed-location and mobile TB screening clinics and spearheaded the state's war against tuberculosis. Between 1933 and 1945 Hart traveled extensively through rural Idaho, covering thousands of miles while lecturing, conducting mass TB screenings, training new staff, and treating the effects of the epidemic.\nAn experienced and accessible writer, Hart wrote widely for medical journals and popular publications, describing TB for technical and general audiences and giving advice on its prevention, detection, and cure. At the time the word \"tuberculosis\" carried a social stigma akin to venereal disease, so Hart insisted his clinics be referred to as \"chest clinics\", himself as a \"chest doctor\", and his patients as \"chest patients\". Discretion and compassion were important tools in treating the stigmatised disease.\nIn 1943 Hart, now recognised as preeminent in the field of tubercular Roentgenology, compiled his extensive evidence on TB and other x-ray-detectable cases into a definitive compendium, These Mysterious Rays: A Nontechnical Discussion of the Uses of X-rays and Radium, Chiefly in Medicine (pub. Harper & Brothers), still a standard text today. The book was translated into several languages, including Spanish.\nIn 1948 Hart was appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. As in Idaho, Dr. Hart took charge of a massive statewide x-ray screening program for TB, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment. He held this position for the rest of his life, and is credited with helping contain the spread of tuberculosis in Connecticut as he had previously in the Pacific Northwest. Similar programs based on his leadership and methodology in this field in other states also saved many thousands of lives.[25]\n\nFiction writing[edit]\nAlongside his medical practice and research, Hart pursued a second career as a novelist. He had in early life published in local, school, and college magazines, and later published four novels, chiefly on medical themes. His four novels incorporate semi-autobiographical themes: The Undaunted (1936) contains a doctor, Richard Cameron, who describes himself as a 'cripple' after his foot is amputated following persistent bone infection. Cameron worries that this physical defect will drive women away, but ends up marrying his sweetheart. A second character, a radiologist named Sandy Farquhar, is a gay man who has been harassed and tormented, driven from job to job, over his sexuality. Farquhar, who is short, thin, and bespectacled, resembles Hart physically, and considers himself \"the possessor of a defective body\" from which he wishes to escape\u2014a typical  asset of gender dysphoria. Another novel, In the Lives of Men, contains a gay male character with a missing arm.\n\nEarly short stories[edit]\nThese short stories were collected in The Life and Career of Alberta Lucille/Dr. Alan L. Hart, with collected early writings, by Brian Booth.[26]\n1908 Frankfort Center (Published in the Albany High School Whirlwind)\nFor an assignment to write about female college members and sporting activities, Hart described the ambiguously-named \"Frances\", a prize boxer and basketball player.\n1909 My Irish Colleen (Published anonymously in the Albany College Student, March 1909 issue)\nA love poem, presented as the work of an anonymous male student about an Irish girl.

Norton & Company, Inc.)\nAn overnight best-seller, Hart's first novel drew on his experiences as a small town doctor in Gardiner, Oregon. It portrayed the medical profession as increasingly venal, and was the first expos\u00e9 of the medical world by a working doctor.\n1936 The Undaunted (Published W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.)\nThis novel showed gay physician \"Sandy Farquhar\" pursuing a career in radiology \"because he thought it wouldn't matter so much in a laboratory what a man's personality was,\" conflicts and themes which Hart himself had experienced in his early career.\n1937 In the Lives of Men (Published W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.)\nHart's third novel was favourably reviewed for its insights into contemporary medicine, but the reviewer at a national magazine (The Saturday Review of Literature) noted \"as a doctor, Hart knows surprisingly little about women\".[27]\n1942 Doctor Finlay Sees it Through (Published by Harper & Brothers)\nHart's final novel, not to be confused with A. J. Cronin's Dr Finlay's Casebook, is considered to have influenced subsequent medical fiction.[28]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nAfter Hart's death his wife acted on his wish to establish a fund for research into leukaemia, from which his mother had died. The interest on his estate is donated annually to the Alan L. and Edna Ruddick Hart Fund, which makes grants for research into leukaemia and its cure.\nHart's will, written in 1943, stipulated that his personal letters and photographs be destroyed, and this was done on his death in 1962. Hart had acted all his life to control the interpretation of his private and emotional life, and the destruction of his personal records at his death were commensurate with this goal.[29] Believing that the secret of his personal history was safe he made no attempt to account for his own life. His identity as the pseudonymous \"H\" in Gilbert's notes[30] was discovered posthumously by Jonathan Ned Katz, and his identity described as lesbian. Katz's attempts to learn more about Hart's life by contacting Hart's widow were discouraged by Edna Ruddick Hart. The message passed on by her friend in Albany was: \"Let that all be passed now. She is older and does not want any more heart ache now.\"[31]\n\nControversy[edit]\nScholarship on Hart's life has disagreed bitterly on whether he should be characterised as transgender, or lesbian, while activists and advocates for various groups have claimed Hart as a representative.\nJonathan Ned Katz, who in Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A. (1976) first identified Hart as the pseudonymous \"H\" in Joseph Gilbert's 1920s case notes, described Hart as a lesbian and depicted his case as one where contemporary strictures against lesbianism were so strong that a 'woman' like Hart had to adopt a male identity to pursue love affairs with women.[32] Katz contended again in his 1983 Gay/Lesbian Almanac: A New Documentary that Hart was \"clearly a lesbian, a woman-loving woman\", but has since said he would not make such claims today.[2][33][34]\nAgainst Katz's claims, others like Jillian Todd Weiss have asserted that Hart experienced himself as a man from early childhood, identifying transphobia and \"blatant disregard for transgender identities\" in the claim that Hart was 'really' a woman.[35] Hart's widow refused interviews to Katz, offended by his categorization of her husband (and by extension, herself) as lesbian.[36]\nSome historians note that Hart never described himself as transsexual, but the term was not published until the 1920s, and not widely used until the 1960s, near Hart's death.[37] It is also true that Hart worked hard to keep his pre-transition identity secret, and would hardly have sought to publicly claim a trans identity. Others, then, have contended that Hart was a trans pioneer, who lived after his transition exclusively as a man, just as modern transgender people do.[36]\nJoy Parks describes the battle, especially within Portland, Oregon GLBT communities over Hart's identity as \"extremely ugly\" and one in which \"neither side appeared particularly victorious.\"[38]\n\nAdditional media[edit]\nAlan L. Hartat Wikipedia's sister projectsMedia from Wikimedia Commons\nTexts from Wikisource\nData from Wikidata\n\n\nExhibitions[edit]\nIn 2002 the Aubrey Watzek Library at Lewis & Clark College ran an exhibition on Hart's life and early writings, titled \"The Lives of Men\": A Literary Glimpse at the Life of Alberta Lucille Hart/Dr. Alan L. Hart, a title drawing on one of Hart's novels. The exhibition's run was extended by nearly a month in light of unexpectedly high interest.\nIn 1994, the story of Alan Lucille Hart and Eva Cushman's attendance at Stanford University, along with a brief description of their subsequent lives, was included in the historical exhibition \"Coming to Terms: Passionate Friendship to Gay Liberation on the Farm\" at Cecil H. Green Library at Stanford. The exhibition was curated by independent scholar Gerard Koskovich; it ran from July through October 1994 and was the subject of a feature article in the Stanford Daily.[39] Note that \"the farm\" in the exhibition title is a nickname for the Stanford campus.\nHart and Cushman's story also was featured in a second historical exhibition at Stanford University: \"Creating Queer Space at Stanford: Pages From a Student Scrapbook,\" which was on display in April and May 2004 in the second floor lobby of Tresidder Memorial Union on the Stanford campus. The exhibition was curated by independent scholar Gerard Koskovich, with Stanford undergraduate Hunter Hargraves serving as associate curator.\nDescribing Hart as transsexual/transgender[edit]\nBair, Henry. \"Lucille Hart Story\" and Brian Booth \"Alan Hart: A Literary Footnote\", in Right to Privacy Ninth Annual Lucille Hart Dinner Booklet (October 6, 1990).\nBates, Tom. \"Decades ago, an Oregon Doctor Tried to Define Gender\"\" The Oregonian (July 14, 1996).\nKoskovich, Gerard. \"Gay at Stanford: Past, Present and Future\" (panel discussion sponsored by the Stanford Historical Society at Stanford University, Dec. 3, 2009).

Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) at the scene of the accident used derogatory epithets and withdrew medical care after cutting open Hunter's pants and discovering that she had a penis,[3] and ER staff at DC General Hospital subsequently provided dilatory and inadequate care.[4]\nHunter died in hospital the same day.  A civil suit was later successfully brought by Hunter's mother against the District of Columbia. \nOver 2,000 people attended her funeral.[5]\n\nLawsuit[edit]\nThe case against the District of Columbia was tried by Richard F. Silber. Dana Priesing, a transgender activist[6] observing the trial, wrote that the evidence supported \"the inference that a stereotype (namely that Hunter was an anonymous, drug-using, transgender street person) affected the treatment Tyra received,\" and that the \"ER staff, as evidenced by their actions, did not consider her life worth saving.\"[7] Adrian Williams, one of the EMTs who had neglected to treat Hunter, testified that he assumed she was a man on sight, \"failing to notice that she had breasts, make-up, women's clothing, a woman's hairstyle, and white nail polish.\"[7] One DC General employee, after being subpoenaed, left for Africa and did not return until late December 1998.[7]  In the end, none of the EMTs involved were ever disciplined.[5]\nOn December 11, 1998, a jury awarded Hunter's mother, Margie, $2,874,060[1] after finding the District of Columbia, through its employees in the DC Fire Department and doctors at DC General, liable under the DC Human Rights Act and for negligence and medical malpractice for causing Hunter's death.  $600,000 was awarded for damages attributable to violations of the DC Human Rights Act associated with the withdrawal of medical care at the accident scene and openly denigrating Hunter with epithets, a further $1.5 million was awarded to her mother for Hunter's conscious pain and suffering and for economic loss from the wrongful death medical malpractice claim.  Doctors at DC General failed to diagnose and treat Hunter who died of internal bleeding in the hospital emergency room.  Evidence at the trial demonstrated that had Hunter been provided with a blood transfusion and referred to a surgeon, she would have had an 86% chance of surviving.[8]  In subsequent negotiations the case was settled for $1.75m.[9]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nTransgender Youth Resources and Advocacy (TYRA), was a program of the former Illinois Gender Advocates and Howard Brown Health Center, was a Chicago area transgender youth initiative named in the memory of Tyra Hunter.[citation needed]\nThe epilogue of Genny Beemyn's 2014 book A Queer Capital: A History of Gay Life in Washington D.C. is \"In Tyra's Memory\".\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nTransgender portal\nBrandon Teena\nMurder of Gwen Araujo\nTransphobia\nList of transgender-related topics\nViolence against LGBT people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Donaldson James, Susan (August 7, 2012). \"Trans Man Denied Cancer Treatment; Now Feds Say It's Illegal\".

Iwamoto's mother went into labor at a private party hosted by Grace Guslander to celebrate the expansion of her Coco Palms Resort, and Iwamoto was then born the next day.  Guslander visited Iwamoto's mother in the hospital with a bouquet of flowers, a card, and a request to name Iwamoto \u201cCoco\u201d after her internationally award-winning hotel.\n\nEducation[edit]\nIwamoto attended Kaimuk\u012b Community Christian Pre-School on O\u02bbahu, H\u014dk\u016blani Elementary School, Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Elementary School, and Hanahau\u02bboli Elementary School.\nIwamoto later attended and graduated from St. Louis High School. She received an Associate of Arts in Merchandising from the Fashion Institute of Technology, a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing from San Francisco State University, and her Juris Doctor from the University of New Mexico School of Law.\nIn 2011, Iwamoto completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow.\n\nFamily and personal life[edit]\nHer paternal great-grandparents left Japan to work in the sugar cane plantations of Kaua\u02bbi.  Iwamoto's paternal grandmother met her paternal grandfather at Tip-Top Restaurant on Kauai, where she was working as a cashier.  The two used their family cars to start a taxi company, which eventually expanded to a tour company and a rental-car company.  Iwamoto's father began working for the family business in high school as a car washer, and their collective efforts became known as Roberts Hawaii.\nIwamoto's maternal grandparents left Japan to grow cantaloupe and other produce in Imperial Valley, California.  During World War II, Iwamoto's mother and her family were forced into internment camps in Poston, Arizona.  Iwamoto's uncles were released from the internment camp to enlist in the military to serve the United States of America.  Eventually the entire family was released and they returned to their farm.  When Iwamoto's mother was in high school, she contributed to the family business by taking care of all the bookkeeping.\n\nA passion for advocacy[edit]\nShortly after finishing her undergraduate degree, Iwamoto moved back to New York City where she had attended FIT. It was here that she became more aware of social injustice.  Using her own life experience as a transgender woman, Iwamoto spent time volunteering at a local community center, helping youth develop leadership skills.  It was here that her passions for helping houseless youth and LGBTQ houseless youth were fostered.  Helping youth like the ones she worked with in New York was part of her motivation for attending law school. When Iwamoto returned to Hawaii she became a licensed therapeutic foster parent.[5]\n\nPublic service and business experience[edit]\nIwamoto recently served as a commissioner on the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission, appointed by Governor Neil Abercrombie to serve the four-year term from 2012 to 2016. She also previously served two terms with the Hawaii Board of Education, Oahu-at-Large from 2006 to 2011. Iwamoto's election as a trans woman in November 2006 made her, at that time, the highest ranking openly transgender elected official in the United States and the first openly transgender official to win statewide office.[6] She was reelected in 2010 with 25% more votes than in 2006.[7]\nIwamoto's other work experiences include serving as Managing Attorney at Volunteer Legal Services Hawaii and facilitating affordable housing through AQuA Rentals, LLC (Affordable Quality Apartment Rentals, LLC).  Her volunteer work includes serving on the Board of Directors for both K\u016blia N\u0101 Mamo and Hawai\u02bbi People\u2019s Fund.[8]\n\n2018 Lieutenant Governor primary election[edit]\nMain article: 2018 Hawaii gubernatorial election\nIwamoto announced her bid for Lieutenant Governor in November 2017.[9] Although she received more than 34,000 votes in the Democratic primary, she lost the party nomination to Sen. Josh Green.[10]\n\nEndorsements for Lieutenant Governor[edit]\nRobert Cazimero, musician and kumu hula\nDaniel Foley, civil rights attorney and judge[11]\nGary Hooser, politician[12]\nMari Matsuda, activist and lawyer[13]\nWalter Ritte, Native Hawaiian educator and activist\nMaya Soetoro-Ng, teacher and advocate[13]\nMaui Time Weekly[14]\nOur Revolution O\u02bbahu Chapter[15]\nSierra Club of Hawaii[16]\nUnite Here!

She has stated that Proposition 8 reminds her of her mother's internment during World War II and believes the proposition is a violation of essential civil rights, stating, \"The country has acknowledged that [internment] as a mistake, to just go with populous fear to oppress a specific group. I think we're going to look back at this kind of oppression as a mistake.\"[19]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"ABOUT KIM COCO\". 2010. Archived from the original on 13 July 2011.

She cited Lena Horne, Mae West, and Josephine Baker as inspirations for her performances, which involved dancing, impersonations, singing, and comedy.[5][4] She was frequently featured in such magazines as Jet, HEP, the LA Advocate, and Variety.\nIn the early fall of 1967, after a successful two-week engagement at Redd Foxx's club which Java was seeking to extend, the Los Angeles Police Department began shutting down the now-famous Java's performances, citing Rule Number 9, a local ordinance prohibiting the \"impersonation by means of costume or dress a person of the opposite sex,\" and threatening to fine clubs that hosted her.[6][4] In response, Java picketed[7] Redd Foxx's club on October 21 and hired the American Civil Liberties Union in a bid to overturn the rule.[8] The courts eventually rejected Java's case with the ACLU, stipulating that only club owners could sue. Rule Number 9 ultimately was struck down after a separate dispute in 1969.[9]\nIn 1978, Java performed with Lena Horne at a birthday party for nightclub owner and columnist Gertrude Gipson.[5]\n\nLater years[edit]\nFrom the 1980s, Java kept a lower public profile. Since retiring from performance and recovering from a stroke, she has made a limited return to public life, appearing locally in southern California and giving interviews. In June 2016, she was a guest of honor at the 18th annual Trans Pride L.A. festival alongside CeCe McDonald.[10] Java has been recognized as a trailblazer.[11]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\nFilm\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1976\nThe Human Tornado\nSelf\n\nIn 1976, Java portrayed herself in the Dolemite sequel The Human Tornado.[12][13]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\n1971 \u2013 Guest of honor, Alpha Chapter (Los Angeles) of the Full Personality Expression[14]\n2016 \u2013 Guest of honor, 18th Annual Trans Pride L.A.[10][15]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Who Is Sir Lady Java\".

Jones created the cover art for over 150 books through 1976, as well as venturing into fine art during and after this time. Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta called Jones \"the greatest living painter\".[2] Although Jones first achieved fame as simply Jeff Jones and lived for a time as male, she later changed her name and transitioned to female.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 The Studio\n\n\n3 Personal life\n\n3.1 Gender transition\n3.2 Death\n\n\n4 Awards\n5 Films\n6 Bibliography\n\n6.1 Books\n6.2 Comics\n\n6.2.1 Charlton Comics\n6.2.2 DC Comics\n6.2.3 Fantagraphics Books\n6.2.4 Gold Key Comics\n6.2.5 HM Communications, Inc.\n6.2.6 Last Gasp\n6.2.7 Marvel Comics\n6.2.8 NL Communications, Inc\n6.2.9 Pacific Comics\n6.2.10 Renaissance Press\n6.2.11 Skywald Publications\n6.2.12 Spiderbaby Grafix\n6.2.13 Topps Comics\n6.2.14 TwoMorrows Publishing\n6.2.15 Warren Publishing\n\n\n\n\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nJeffrey Durwood Jones was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia.[3] As a child, her father was overseas in the military.[3] She graduated from Georgia State College[4] in 1967 with a degree in geology and was keenly interested in art and admired the work of Johannes Vermeer, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, and Rembrandt.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nJones moved to New York City to pursue an art career and quickly found work drawing comics pages for King Comics, Gold Key Comics, Creepy, Eerie, and Vampirella, as well as Wally Wood\u2019s Witzend.[6] She painted covers for books, including the Ace paperback editions of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series and Andre Norton's Postmarked the Stars, The Zero Stone, Uncharted Stars and many others. For a period during the early 1970s, Jones also provided illustrations to Ted White's Fantastic. She drew many covers and short stories for a variety of comics publishers including DC Comics, Skywald Publications, and Warren[7] but generally avoided the superhero genre.[8]\nIn the 1972\u20131975 issues of National Lampoon, Jones produced a full page strip entitled Idyl.[9]\n\nThe Studio[edit]\nFrom 1975 to 1979 Jones shared a workspace in Manhattan's Chelsea district with Bernie Wrightson, Barry Windsor-Smith, and Michael Kaluta, collectively named The Studio. Dragon's Dream produced a volume of their work in 1979. Industry journalist Tom Spurgeon commented on the broader significance and influence of The Studio in his obituary of Jones at The Comics Reporter:\n\nThe legacy of that much talent doing what was collectively very good work at a point of almost monolithic and degrading corporate influence over the kind of art they wanted to do has provided The Studio with a legacy that can be embraced even by those that didn't particularly care for the artists' output. The idea of a dedicated workplace that would allow for coercive influence one artist to another has been carried over into very nearly ever cartoonists' collective space initiative since.[10]\nBy the early 1980s she had a recurring strip in Heavy Metal titled I'm Age.[9] Cartoonists Walter Simonson and J. D. King said at the time that Jones had a growing interest in expressionism and did not pursue comic work as closely thereafter.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1964 while attending Georgia State College, Jones met fellow student Mary Louise Alexander (later notable as writer Louise Simonson). The two began dating and were married in 1966. Their daughter Julianna was born the following year. After graduation, the couple moved to New York City but divorced in the early 1970s.[4]\n\nGender transition[edit]\nAs an adult, Jones recalled wanting to be a girl from her earliest memories. She confronted these issues in 1998 and began hormone replacement therapy.[3] Comics writer and journalist Steven Ringgenberg elaborated on the transition in an obituary/tribute to Jones at The Comics Journal:\n\nIt's now known from the artist\u2019s personal writings that she had felt conflicted about her gender since childhood, always feeling a greater affinity for the fair sex than for her own maleness. Having grown up as a product of the patriarchal 1950s, with a domineering war-hero father, Jones did not know how to cope with her yearning to be female, and felt ashamed. For years she tried to drown these feelings in alcohol, but, after much soul-searching, Jones realized that although she\u2019d been born male, inside she was a woman. She began hormone replacement therapy in 1998, and set out upon a new phase of life as a woman, changing her name to Jeffrey Catherine Jones. Yet even this transition did not bring peace to this gentle, troubled artist, for in 2001, she suffered a nervous breakdown, which led to the loss of her home and studio. However, she eventually recovered, and by 2004 began painting and drawing again.[6]\nDeath[edit]\nJones' personal Facebook page reported following her death: \"Legendary fantasy artist Jeffrey Catherine Jones passed away today, Thursday May 19, 2011 at 4:00 am surrounded by family. Jeffrey suffered from severe emphysema and bronchitis as well as hardening of the arteries around the heart...\"[11] She was survived by her daughter.\n\nAwards[edit]\nJones was nominated for the Hugo Award for best fan artist in 1967, and for the best professional artist Hugo in 1970, 1971, and 1972. In 1975 she was nominated for the World Fantasy Award for best artist and won the award in 1986.  Additionally, Jones was nominated for the Chesley Award in 1999.[12]\n\nFilms[edit]\nIn 2012 a film retrospective on DVD by Maria P. Cabardo was released by Indiegogo featuring interviews with friends, fellow artists, and the artist herself titled Better Things: The Life and Choices of Jeffrey Catherine Jones.\n\nBibliography[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nAge of Innocence: The Romantic Art of Jeffrey Jones 39 pages, Underwood Books, August 1994, ISBN\u00a0978-0887331855\nThe Art of Jeffrey Jones 160 pages, Underwood Books, October 2002, ISBN\u00a0978-1887424578\nJeffrey Jones Sketchbook 107 pages, Vanguard Productions, April 2007, ISBN\u00a0978-1887591102\nAbsolute Death includes \"A Winter's Tale\" a six-page short story written by Neil Gaiman and drawn by Jones, 360 pages, DC Comics, October 2009, ISBN\u00a0978-1401224639\nJeffrey Jones: A Life in Art 256 pages, IDW Publishing, January 2011, ISBN\u00a0978-1600107375\nJeffrey Jones: The Definitive Reference 178 pages, Vanguard Productions, May 2013, ISBN\u00a0978-1934331545\nComics[edit]\n\nCharlton Comics[edit]\nCharlton Bullseye #1 (1975)\nFlash Gordon #13 (1969)\nDC Comics[edit]\nThe Dark Mansion of Forbidden Love #3 (cover) (1972)\nHeroes Against Hunger #1 (1986)\nShowcase #83\u201384 (Nightmaster) (1969)\nVertigo: Winter's Edge #2 (1999)\nThe Witching Hour #14 (1971)\nWonder Woman #199\u2013200 (covers) (1972)[8]\nFantagraphics Books[edit]\nJones Touch #1 (1993)\nVaughn Bod\u0113's Erotica #2 (introduction) (1996)\nGold Key Comics[edit]\nBoris Karloff Tales of Mystery #21 (1968)\nHM Communications, Inc.[edit]\nHeavy Metal #v4 #2, 11; #v5 #3\u20134, 6\u201312; #v6 #2\u201312; #v7 #1\u201312 #v8 #1\u20134; #v11 #2 (1981\u20131987)\nLast Gasp[edit]\nSpasm #1 (1973)\nMarvel Comics[edit]\nConan Saga #31 (1989)\nEpic Illustrated #10, 19, 25, 30 (1982\u20131985)\nHeroes for Hope Starring The X-Men #1 (1985)\nSavage Sword of Conan #5 (1975)\nNL Communications, Inc[edit]\nNational Lampoon #v1 #28, 35, 38\u201339, 46\u201352, 54, 56\u201360 (1972\u20131975)\nPacific Comics[edit]\nAlien Worlds #4 (1983)\nBerni Wrightson: Master of the Macabre #4 (1984)\nPathways to Fantasy #1 (1984)\nRavens and Rainbows #1 (1983)\nRenaissance Press[edit]\nThe Forbidden Book #1 (2001)\nSkywald Publications[edit]\nNightmare #6\u20137 (covers), 21 (1971\u20131974)\nPsycho #5\u20136, 9, 12 (1971\u20131973)\nSpiderbaby Grafix[edit]\nTaboo #5 (1991)\nTopps Comics[edit]\nJurassic Park tpb (1993)\nTwoMorrows Publishing[edit]\nStreetwise #1 (2000)\nWarren Publishing[edit]\nComix International #3 (1975)\nCreepy #16, 29, 91, 103, 120 (1967\u20131980)\nEerie #11-12, 15, 27 (1967\u20131970)\nVampirella #4\u20135, 9, 12, 27, 32\u201334, 50, 83 (1970\u20131979)\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Phegley, Kiel (May 19, 2011). \"R.I.P.

At the age of 16, Lees committed a robbery, for which she served eight months in prison, beginning at the age of 18. Lees later said, \"I had dropped out of college. Basically, I had gone off the rails because I was terrified of going to prison. I ended up taking lots of drugs.\"[6] While in prison Lees decided to change: \"I just thought, 'I'm this silly teenage boy in a prison cell who has made a huge mistake and I want to be this happy person'.\"[6]\nLees moved to Brighton to study English at university and started to identify as female. \"In the space of six weeks I went from living in Nottingham as a boy with my grandma still alive, to living in Brighton as a girl.\"[6] She was referred to Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic where she received hormone treatment to begin gender transition.[7]\n\nJournalism and presenting[edit]\nLees founded the first British magazine aimed at the trans community, META,[3][6] and was the acting assistant editor of Gay Times.[8] She also has columns in both Gay Times and Diva,[9] and was the first trans cover girl for Diva.[1][6]\nLees has also written for mainstream newspapers and magazines, including The Independent, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, and Vice,[8][9][10][11] as well as for Channel 4 News.[12]\nLees has worked as a presenter for television and radio, being the first trans woman presenter on both BBC Radio 1 and Channel 4.[1][6] On Radio 1, she produced a documentary entitled \"The Hate Debate\" for BBC Radio 1's Stories in which the attitudes people have to minority groups were considered, along with racism, homophobia, transphobia and Islamophobia.[11] Critics praising Lees for doing \"a fine job of provoking her listeners\"[13] and for seeming \"genuinely interested in the opinions of the young people she interviewed\".[14] \"The Hate Debate\" was followed up with a second documentary in the same slot, \"My Transgender Punk Rock Story\", interviewing transgender rock star Laura Jane Grace and introducing the teenage audience to trans concepts of identity both within and outside of the binary. She also presented the episode \"Trans\" of Channel 4's The Shooting Gallery.[15]\nOn 25 October 2013, Lees took part as a panellist in the BBC's 100 Women event.[16] On 31 October 2013 Lees became the first openly transgender panellist to appear on the BBC's Question Time programme, drawing praise from commentators who included former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and the Labour Party deputy leader Harriet Harman.[17]\nIn 2018, Lees was appointed as Vogue's first transgender columnist.[5]\n\nActivism[edit]\nLees, working with Trans Media Watch, challenged Channel 4 to remove transphobic material from its broadcasts,[2] and consulted with the channel for its documentary My Transsexual Summer.[18][19] She has worked with a number of media outlets to provide guidance on covering transgender people; in its 2013 Pink List award coverage, The Independent on Sunday said \"It was noted by our judges that the Daily Mail's coverage of trans issues has improved noticeably since she had lunch with its managing editor\".[1]\nLees currently works with All About Trans, a project that tries to bring together journalists and other media professionals with transgender people.[6][20]\nIn 2013, Lees topped The Independent on Sunday's Pink List, naming her as the most influential lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender figure in the UK; she was a judge for that award in 2011 and 2012.[1][6]\nLees has said that social media is a key tool for transgender people to improve their societal recognition:\n\nPeople have been taking the piss out of trans people for 60 years. The narrative on trans issues has been controlled by people who have no understanding of them. Social media is about us grabbing the narrative back and telling our own stories \u2013 this is our reality, this is what we go through and this is what matters to us. We're here, we're in your face, we definitely exist. That's the most important thing \u2013 realising we exist.[21]\nLees also expressed objections to \"#fuckcispeople\", a controversial trending hashtag on the social networking site Twitter referring to cisgender people, which she thought was counterproductive: \"It is much better to engage in a positive dialogue than through angry abuse\".[22]\nIn November 2014, Lees appeared in Hollyoaks, playing herself, and a friend of transgender character Blessing Chambers (Modupe Adeyeye).\nOn 11 August 2014, Lees was supposed to be on air with BBC Newsnight recording to talk about the impact of Kellie Maloney coming out as a trans woman. However Lees refused to be a part of the show as she tweeted that \"I've turned down BBC Newsnight as I'm not prepared to enter into a fabricated debate about trans people's right to exist/express themselves\".[23]\nIn May 2016 Lees, alongside Brooke Magnanti, was called to give evidence about conditions for sex workers in the UK to the Home Affairs Select Committee investigating prostitution laws in Britain.[24] The resulting recommendations by the committee headed by Keith Vaz, released in July 2016, implemented Lees and Magnanti's suggestions.[25] to eliminate criminal records[26] of those arrested for prostitution-related crimes.[27] Sex worker nonprofits called the apparent U-turn decision \"a stunning victory for sex workers and our demands for decriminalisation\" and \"a giant step forward for sex workers' rights in the UK\".[28]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nLees has publicly identified herself as a bisexual trans woman and as a feminist.[11][29] Lees has written about how in the early days of her gender transition she received abuse for not passing as female.[21]\nIn response to the announced gender transition of Chelsea Manning, Lees revealed that as a teenager and before her transition, she had gone to prison for robbery. Lees\u2014who then was living as an effeminate gay male\u2014said of the experience that \"looking like a girly boy in an institute full of rough lads wasn't a barrel of laughs\", but that prison was less violent than school was because other prisoners were more disposed to harming themselves than others.[30]\nAfter her release from prison and being turned down for a part-time job answering phones, Lees described having an epiphany: \"When I realised I would like to change society, not myself, all these good things have come into my life\".[6] She subsequently received a referral to Charing Cross Hospital's gender identity clinic, and met her boyfriend shortly after beginning hormone replacement therapy.[6]\nIn 2018 she became the first openly transgender woman featured in British Vogue.[31] She later became a columnist with British Vogue in November 2018.[32]\nShe was also the first openly transgender presenter on Radio 1 and Channel 4.[33]\n\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT rights in the United Kingdom\nTransgender rights in the United Kingdom\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f \"The Independent on Sunday's Pink List 2013\".

Stories from a Transgender DadWebsitewww.milkjunkies.net\nTrevor Kirczenow MacDonald (born 1985) is a Canadian transgender health researcher and author in the field of LGBTQ lactation and infant feeding. He is the first female-to-male transsexual to have been accredited as a leader with the breastfeeding support organization, La Leche League.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Application for La Leche League leadership\n2.2 Research\n2.3 Community organization\n2.4 Midwifery care for trans clients\n\n\n3 Works\n4 Politics\n5 References\n\n\nLife[edit]\nHaving been assigned female at birth, MacDonald transitioned to male by taking testosterone and undergoing chest surgery. When he and his partner decided to start a family, on advice from a doctor, MacDonald stopped hormone therapy and was able to become pregnant. Although MacDonald did not plan to breastfeed and assumed it would not be possible, he decided to try after learning that \"even a small amount of milk could be really valuable to my baby,\" and that \"breastfeeding is about more than the milk. It can be a relationship too and a whole way of parenting.\"[1]\n\nCareer[edit]\nApplication for La Leche League leadership[edit]\nBefore his child was born, MacDonald sought peer-to-peer support from his local chapter of La Leche League (LLL), the international breastfeeding organization. He was later asked to assume a volunteer leadership position. However, La Leche League Canada (LLLC) rejected his query, saying \"the topic has never arisen in the 56-year history of our organization\"[2] and \"since an LLLC leader is a mother who breastfed a baby, a man cannot become an LLLC leader.\"[3][4]\nThe board of La Leche League International (LLLI) reviewed the policy,[5] citing its mandate to be a \"nondiscriminatory service organization.\" A year later, they revised their policy to allow leaders to serve no matter their gender.[6] LLLI spokesperson Diana West commented, \u201cIt was thought that only women could breastfeed. Once it became clear it wasn\u2019t as straightforward as that, the policy had to change. We\u2019re just trying to be on the right side of history. Yes, we took a year to do it, but we did it in a way that was fair and unequivocal.\u201d[7]\nIn 2016, MacDonald became the first-ever transgender man to be accredited as a La Leche League leader. LLLI said in a statement to other leaders: \"We recognize that any breastfeeding parent, regardless of whether they self-identify as a mother or father, should be - and is now - welcome to investigate LLL Leadership. There are other prerequisites that a potential Leader needs to satisfy, but being a woman isn't one of them.\u201d[8]\n\nResearch[edit]\nIn 2014, MacDonald formed a research team[9] through the University of Ottawa which obtained funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to conduct qualitative research about transmasculine individuals' experiences of pregnancy, birthing, and feeding their newborns.[10]\nThe group's research paper, \"Transmasculine individuals\u2019 experiences with lactation, chestfeeding, and gender identity: a qualitative study,\"[11] contains the first known use of the word \"chestfeeding\" in the title of an academic paper,[12] which is a term preferred by some transmasculine individuals to describe their lactation and nursing relationship.[13] The paper is in the top 1% of the most-viewed academic research papers of all time.[14]\nMacDonald says \u201cThere is this assumption that goes along with the \u2018born in the wrong body\u2019 narrative, that if you are a trans guy you would want a hysterectomy and never use your body to carry a pregnancy.\u201d[9] He noted that none of the participants' surgeons discussed the potential for future chestfeeding before performing top surgery, and that \u201cthe range of experiences and showing more nuance, more complexity, about transgender lives is what is most important in this study.\"[12]\n\nCommunity organization[edit]\nIn 2012, MacDonald founded the international support group, \"Birthing and Breast or Chestfeeding Trans People and Allies\".[15] The group currently has over 1700 members.[16]\n\nMidwifery care for trans clients[edit]\nIn 2015, several commentators claimed that MacDonald, who was attended by midwives during his pregnancies, had forced the Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA) to stop using gendered language such as \"mothers\" and \"pregnant women.\"[17][18][19] However, Snopes reported that while MANA did change some of the language in their core materials to clarify they welcomed transgender and cisgender clients in their scope of practice, those decisions were based on their own standards of care, inclusion, and position on gender identity, and not due to pressure from MacDonald or any other trans people.[20]\nFollowing MANA's announcement, a group of midwives penned an open letter to MANA protesting what they viewed as \"the erasure of women from the language of birth.\"[21] MacDonald wrote a response in the Huffington Post[22] saying that \"trans, genderqueer and intersex people have been giving birth for as long as women-identified people have\" and \"it is possible to be inclusive.\"[22] Several other associations of midwives subsequently issued statements supportive of MANA and gender nonconforming clients.[23][24][25][26]\n\nWorks[edit]\nMacDonald has written for The Guardian, The Advocate,[27] the Huffington Post,[28] Out Magazine and This Magazine. He is a public speaker about transgender people and reproductive health, including lactation.[29][30][31]\nHe is first author on the first peer-reviewed medical research article on the subject of transmasculine infant chestfeeding.[11]\nMacDonald is the author of a tip sheet for volunteer leaders who are providing support to transgender, transsexual, and genderfluid individuals who wish to nurse their babies[32] and was profiled in La Leche League International's magazine, Breastfeeding Today.[33]\nMacDonald's 2016 biography, \"Where's the Mother? Stories from a Transgender Dad,\"[34] has been added to the required reading list for Doula Trainings International, who commented that the book is \"eye-opening for new and seasoned doulas alike.\"[35] It was reviewed by Publishers Weekly as \"frank, clever, and easy to process ... a refreshing and insightful narrative.\"[36] The work has also received coverage in The New York Times,[37] The Guardian,[9] The Toronto Star,[15] Buzzfeed,[38] Gay Star News,[39] Metro UK,[40] The Advocate,[41] Rewire,[42] and on the Canadian Television Network's national newscast.[43]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nMacDonald was the Liberal Party candidate for Provencher in the 2019 Canadian federal election,[44] running under his legal name, Trevor Kirczenow. He is the first openly transgender candidate to have been nominated by a major Canadian political party.[45]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Manitoba father who breastfeeds shares story to promote tolerance\".

As a child, she recalls feeling \"uncomfortable in her body,\" and had the \"most difficult time\" in her physical education class because, she says, \"I didn't fit in at all.\"\n\nLater life[edit]\nAfter undergoing some sex-reassignment surgeries (due to stipulations in employment contracts, Marks hasn't had complete sexual reassignment), Marks became Mimi. According to Trantasia,[2] a transsexual beauty pageant documentary, she has lived as a woman since she was 21 years old. Marks started performing in Milwaukee at a club called Dance, Dance, Dance with help from an Australian performer, Holly Brown. Marks says that, for trans women in Chicago, the test of whether they can pass as women is to appear in public at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs: \"\"If you could walk through Wrigley-ville, like, during a Cubs game and not get 'spooked,' and not have anybody call you out, you were like the 'girl-iest' girl, you made it. I called [a friend] and said, 'I am at a Cubs game on first base, eleventh row. I made it. I'm a girl!'\"[3]\nIn 1986, Marks won her first pageant title: Ms. Waterloo 1986. She has also won Miss International Queen, Pattaya, Thailand; The World's Most Beautiful Transsexual Contest, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; and Miss Continental, Chicago, Illinois, USA.\nIn 2008 Marks appeared in Janet Jackson's music video Rock With U.[4]\nMarks is reported to have been the first ever openly transsexual runway model, working for the Ford Modeling agency.\nShe performed at The Baton Show Lounge in Chicago, Illinois until retiring from the stage in January 2016.[5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Mimi Marks (@mimimarks11)\". twitter.com.

Her father, a police superintendent of the Brahmin caste, gave her away shortly after she was born to protect his own social image.[2]\nShe attended only two years of primary schooling but learned 12 languages during her travels.\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nShabnam Mausi was elected from the Sohagpur constituency in Madhya Pradesh state's Shahdol-Anuppur district. As a member of the Legislative Assembly, her agenda included fighting corruption, unemployment, poverty, and hunger, as well as speaking out against discrimination against transgender people, hijras, eunuchs, cross-dressers and raising awareness about HIV/AIDS.\n\nActivism[edit]\nShabnam Mausi inspired many transgender people in India to take up politics and participate in 'mainstream activities' in India, giving up their traditional roles as dancers, prostitutes, and beggars, living on the fringes of Indian society; for example they sometimes attend weddings or the house of a newborn child offering services to ward off bad luck.[citation needed]\n\nJeeti Jitayi Politics (JJP)[edit]\nIn 2003, hijras in Madhya Pradesh established their own political party called \"Jeeti Jitayi Politics\" (JJP), which literally means 'politics that has already been won'.[3] The party released an eight-page manifesto to outline its political differences from the mainstream.\n\nPopular culture[edit]\nIn 2005, a fiction feature film titled Shabnam Mausi[4] was made about her life. It was directed by Yogesh Bharadwaj, and the role of Shabnam Mausi was played by Ashutosh Rana.\nAlthough she is no longer in public office, Shabnam Mausi continues to participate actively in AIDS/HIV with NGOs and gender activists in India.\n\n\"We brothers and sisters often face stigma and discrimination because of our sexual orientation.

On December 22, 2002 Morris suffered a severe head injury from which she did not recover. Morris died on December 24, 2002, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital,[1] when she was removed from life support. The Philadelphia Police Department's handling of Morris' death sparked protests in the LGBT community[2] and led to several investigations into the police coverup of her death.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n2 Injury and death\n3 Aftermath and funeral\n4 Questions and controversy\n5 Second opinion\n6 Contradictions and more questions\n7 Morris Home\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 External links\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nNizah Morris began living as a woman in her early 20s. By December 2002 she had built a life for herself working at her mother's daycare center, performing in the weekly drag show at Bob and Barbara's\u2014a bar in Philadelphia's Center City neighborhood\u2014and practicing Buddhism.\n\nInjury and death[edit]\nOn December 22, Morris attended a party at the Key West Bar at the intersection of Juniper and Chancellor streets in Philadelphia. Morris left the bar at 2:00\u00a0a.m., and collapsed outside of the bar due to intoxication. Onlookers formed a group around Morris\u2014who could not stand without assistance and had to be supported, according to witnesses\u2014and waited for paramedics for approximately 20 minutes.\nA 6th District police officer arrived, canceled the prior call for paramedics when Morris declined to go to a hospital, and offered her a courtesy ride to a hospital. Morris declined a ride to the hospital and asked to be taken home. Witnesses at the scene reportedly helped her into the police cruiser.\nThough Morris lived in the 5000 block of Walnut Street, police officers reported that she asked to be let out at 15th and Walnut streets, left the patrol car, and began walking toward 16th Street.\nMinutes later, a passing motorist discovered Morris lying on the sidewalk, bleeding from the right side of her forehead. A call was placed to 911, and a 9th District officer arrived at the scene, but did not call a supervisor or treat the event as a crime.\nMorris was transported to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in critical condition. On December 23, 2002, she was removed from life support, and at 8:30\u00a0p.m. on December 24, 2002, Nizah Morris was pronounced dead.[4]\n\nAftermath and funeral[edit]\nOn December 25, 2002, the Medical Examiner's office classified Morris' death as a homicide.  However, the Police Department's homicide unit refused to accept this ruling, classified Morris' death as accidental, and requested a second opinion from a brain-injury specialist.\nThe following day, Morris' mother\u2014Roslyn Wilkins\u2014was notified of her daughter's death by a detective who informed her, \"He's dead.\" The detective was removed from the case after Wilkins complained about his alleged insensitivity.[5]\nOn December 27, 2002, family members viewed photographs of Morris' body at the Medical Examiner's office, and expressed concern upon noticing slight indentation marks on her wrists. Morris' mother and sister said medical examiners showed them pictures indicating defensive wounds on her hands.[6]\nOn December 31, 2002, the Philadelphia Inquirer published the first media account of Morris' death, which referred to her as a \"prostitute\" in the headline and a \"male prostitute\" in the body of the story.\nNizah Morris was cremated on January 1, 2003, after a funeral service attended by more than 300 people.[7]\n\nQuestions and controversy[edit]\nIn the days after Morris' funeral, questions concerning her death arose among her family members and in the LGBT community. During a meeting on January 7, 2003 with Homicide Captain Charles Bloom, Wilkins learned that her daughter received a courtesy ride from police 20 minutes before she was discovered lying on the sidewalk with a head injury.[5]\nDetails supplied by police about the moments prior to and following Morris' injury and discovery by a passing motorist conflicted with family members' recollections of Morris, and with witnesses' accounts prior to Morris entering the police car outside of the Key West Bar.\nMorris' family doubted she would have accepted a ride from the police, given her fear of them, and questioned why she would ask to be dropped off miles from where she lived. A key witness to the event stated that when she asked Nizah where she lived that it sounded like 15th and Walnut.  The message could have been misconstrued because Ms. Morris was incoherent.\nA key missing fact is that when after being helped the first time (before the police arrived) was that after the initial help, Nizah was found in the street after a taxi refused her service.  The taxi took off with the door open and with such force that this initial fall could have caused damage.\nWitnesses who were outside of the Key West Bar said Morris was incapable of standing on her own, and had to be helped into the police car. They doubted that she would have been capable, just minutes later, of getting out of the police car on her own and walking away as police officers reported.\n\nSecond opinion[edit]\nOn January 30, 2003, more than a month after Morris' death and the Medical Examiner's assessment that it was a homicide, the homicide division of the police department officially declared Morris' death a homicide. Tests performed by a brain-injury specialist, on samples taken during an initial autopsy, resulted in a finding that her death was due to cerebral injury.[8]\nPolice initially suggested Morris' death had been accidental, and a police spokesman declined to comment on what led the Medical Examiner to conclude Morris' death was a homicide.\n\nContradictions and more questions[edit]\nContradictions between police accounts and witness accounts, and incomplete compliance with police procedures also aroused concerns that Morris case had been mishandled and the cause of her injury and subsequent death covered up because of her status as an African American transgender woman.[9]\nMany of these contradictions and questions were reported by Timothy Cwiek, a reporter for Philadelphia Gay News, who has followed the story of Morris' story since the first reports of her death. For his investigative reporting on Morris' death, Cwiek was awarded the Society of Professional Journalists Sigma Delta Chi Award.[10]\nRelying on Cwiek's investigative work, author Kenneth Lipp of The Daily Beast, summarizes the aftermath of Morris' death in saying: \"police and prosecutors hid critical information about what happened. Cops misreported Morris's ride with Skala in official logs; the homicide squad did not accept the medical examiner's determination that she had been killed; and the police department 'lost' her homicide report for eight years. Meanwhile, the district attorney's office refused to give police files to the civilian oversight board reviewing Morris's case. When the DA finally turned over the files, it forced the board to sign a nondisclosure agreement that would keep what they found hidden forever.\"[3]\nCwiek reported the following contradictions and procedural lapses in the Morris case:[11]\n\n2:45\u00a0a.m. Police accounts say 6th District officer Elizabeth Skala stopped outside of the Key West Bar and offered Morris a courtesy ride. Witness accounts say that Officer Skala stopped to ask if Morris needed to be taken to a hospital, but Morris \"waved off\" Officer Skala's offer. Officer Skala denied this first encounter.\n3:07\u00a0a.m. - The first 911 call is placed and an ambulance dispatched to the intersection of Juniper and Chancellor Streets, outside of the Key West Bar. Ninth District Officer Kenneth Novak was also dispatched, with Officer Skala as his back-up. Novak and Skala accepted the assignment to investigate the situation outside of the Key West Bar. Dispatch records show Officer Novak arrived first, but Officer Skala says she arrived first.\nSkala then indicated to Novak that she did not require his assistance with Morris\u2014who, aside from being intoxicated, was over six feet tall and a foot taller than officer Skala. Novack did not place himself back in service for new assignments, but instead tried to catch up with Skala on the courtesy ride, but did not use his police radio to coordinate movements with Skala, and arrived at the scene too late.\nOfficer Skala then says she gave Morris a ride home, but thought Morris said she lived at 15th and Walnut streets, where police report Morris asked to get out of the vehicle. According to Officer Skala, the ride lasted four minutes. Her log indicated that it lasted 16 minutes.\n3:25\u00a0a.m. Ninth District Officer Thomas Berry said he offered to help Morris out of the car at 15th and Walnut Streets, but that she did not need his help. Witnesses at the Key West Bar said that Morris was unable to stand on her own and had to be helped into the police car.\nThe officers' logs at this point record the incident as a successful hospital run, and do not record Morris leaving the police car at 15th and Walnut streets.\n3:35\u00a0a.m. - A second series of 911 calls takes place when Morris is found at 16th and Walnut streets, injured and unconscious, but breathing. Officer Berry takes control of the scene, and reports the incident as a \"DK,\" police department code for a drunken fall. Officer Berry did not interview the citizen who discovered Morris and stopped to help her. No photographs were taken of the scene, nor was evidence such as Morris' purse and hair brush preserved.\nBerry's incident report said he left the injury scene at 3:35\u00a0a.m., but a 911 tape indicates Berry did not leave the scene until 4:05\u00a0a.m., as paramedics were placing Morris in the ambulance.\nOfficer Novak was assigned to investigate the scene, and accepted the assignment, but no report was filed.\nCitizen witnesses said that no first aid appeared to be offered to Morris, nor were any apparent efforts made to stabilize her head before moving her or placing her in the ambulance. Witnesses also said that before Morris was placed in the ambulance, Officer Berry used Morris' jacket to cover her face, as if to indicate that she was already dead.\n4:15\u00a0a.m. - Hospital records indicate Morris' admission to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Records also indicate that the hospital summoned police officers to help identify Morris, whom they suspected was a crime victim, which suggests Morris was delivered to the hospital without being identified.\nOfficer Novak was dispatched to the hospital to investigate. Novak calls Officers Berry and Skala to the hospital, where the three again assess the cause of Morris' injury as a drunken fall. No reports are filed concerning the investigation at the hospital.\nMorris remained in the hospital for 64 hours, unidentified. Officer Novak, however, was familiar with Morris due to her previous arrests for offenses related to prostitution. At no point did he identify her to hospital staff. Hospital records show staff efforts to identify Morris, whose fingerprints would have been on file due to her previous arrests.\nWitnesses at the injury scene also identified Morris to Officer Berry by name and her employment at Bob and Barbaras. There is no indication that Officer Berry passed this information to the hospital.\nMorris was removed from life support after 64 hours in the hospital, and her family was informed of her death the following day.\nQuestions and concerns led to the first of several LGBT community meetings, protests and vigils in response to Morris' death and the police department's handling of the investigation.\nIn April 2003 the Philadelphia Police Department released an edited version of the 911 recording, which included 3 transmissions between officers Skala, Novak, and Berry. The edited recording started at 3:07\u00a0a.m. and ended six minutes later.[12]\nThe same month, in response to community concern, District Attorney Lynne Abraham launched an investigation of Morris' case, and promised to seek physical evidence, including the related 911 recording. However, the investigation ended in December 2003, without finding Morris' killer. Abraham asked for the public's help to investigate the case further, stated that the three officers in the case acted properly, and cited the courtesy ride given to Morris as a \"humanitarian gesture.\"[13]\nIn May 2003, Morris' mother, Roselyn Wilkins, filed a complaint with the independent oversight Police Advisory Commission against the Philadelphia Police Department for the \"lack of information provided to the family by the Police Department.\"[3] It would not hold hearings on Wilkins' complaint for three and a half more years (December 2006).[3]\nIn September 2003 the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights launched a civil suit against the Key West Bar where Morris became intoxicated, the police officers involved, the emergency technicians and the city of Philadelphia itself.[14] The suit was settled for $250,000 in May 2004.[15]\nIn December 2003, in response to community pressure, the Police Advisory Commission released dispatch records suggesting that the transmissions on the tape lasted for 49 minutes.[16]\nIn December 2006 the Police Advisory Commission held hearings on the complaint against the Philadelphia Police Department and their investigation continued slowly over the next year.[3]\nIn January 2007 the Philadelphia Police Department refused to release an unedited version of the 911 recording. In March 2007 the department agreed to play a complete version of the 911 tape for the Police Advisory Commission.[16]\nIn November 2007, the Police Advisory Commission completed its investigation. They found that with the exception of Officer Skala, the officers involved had acted properly. Within days, the Philadelphia Police Department advised the Police Advisory Commission that their decision was based on incomplete documents, unbeknownst to the advisory group at the time. The information was uncovered in 2007 when a detective, under oath, was forced to admit that Morris' homicide report had been missing since 2003.[3] Apparently, \"the report was not 'found' again until 2011, in the City Hall archives.\"[3]\nIn March 2008, the Police Advisory Commission voted to reopen the investigation into Morris' death. The group subpoenaed the records and \"fought with District Attorney Lynne Abraham until November for access to evidence\" who only agreed to do under the condition that the members of the group sign non-disclosure agreements regarding the contents of the file.[3] The introduction of the nondisclosure agreement ensured that they would be able to release any public report or take any remedial action based on the findings of their investigation, rendering the investigation worthless.[3]\nIn 2011, under new leadership, the Police Advisory Commission voted yet again to reopen the investigation. The new Executive Director, Kelvyn Anderson, stated that the \"nondisclosure agreement that the 2008 Police Advisory Commission entered into with the DA undermines our effectiveness and credibility as a civilian oversight board and compromises the openness and transparency that is our raison d'\u00eatre.\" Calling \"the magnitude of mismanagement of the Nizah Morris homicide [to be] staggering,\" Anderson sent a letter requesting a full investigation from U.S. Attorney Zane Memenger.[3] The letter cites that the Philadelphia Police Department investigation was a \"litany of errors\" including procedural errors in policing, hospital errors, handling intoxicated persons, record keeping, logging information, document storage, hiding communications, \"off-the-record\" communiques, missing evidence, and testimony so inconsistent to rise to the level of perjury.[3]\nIn 2015, The Daily Beast reported that the U.S. Attorney General's office did not respond to the Police Advisory Commission's request for an appropriate and full investigation.[3] Similarly, the Pennsylvania Attorney General Office declined to investigate, \"saying the case was not in their jurisdiction.\"[3] Additionally, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office refuses an outside review of the evidence in Nizah Morris' homicide, telling The Daily Beast that \"the district attorney feels that it is his responsibility to continue to be the sole investigating office in criminal cases.\"[3]\nIn 2015, Officer Elizabeth Skala-DiDonato has only received a \"verbal reprimand\" despite the Police Advisory Commission's finding that she \"blatantly and methodically\" lied about her interactions with Morris on the night of her homicide.[3] \"She was transferred from street duty not long after Morris was killed, and reportedly works in the commissioner's office.\"[3]\n\nMorris Home[edit]\nIn 2011, Philadelphia opened an addiction treatment center for transgender Philadelphians, named The Morris Home for Trans and Gender-Variant People after her.[17][18][19] The Morris Home for Trans and Gender-Variant People \"is the only inpatient facility of its kind in the United States to [be] operated by the transgender people to specifically focus on transgender people.\"[20]\n\nSee also[edit]\nViolence against LGBT people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Thomas Jefferson University Hospital Web Site\n\n^ Sycamore, Mattilda Bernstein (2008-05-28).

During her time with the Army she undertook a number of roles and postings, including advising on chemical warfare attacks, overseeing food rations and managing property. She also took part in the Gulf War of 1990\u201391, and was awarded the Kuwait Liberation Medal and Gulf War Medal. Muston left the Army in 1996.[1]\nAlthough Muston has stated that she \"felt different from the age of eight or nine onwards\", she did not begin to feel comfortable about the possibility of being a transgender woman until after leaving the Army, and did not come out publicly until 2007. Her interest in politics began after she was demobilised and, as well as serving as a councillor, she has been chair of Gender Matters, a gender-awareness and support charity based in Compton, West Midlands, as well as vice chair of LGBT Wolverhampton.[1] She has also been an officer with LGBT Labour.[4]\nIn her role with LGBT Labour, Muston attended an LGBT History Month reception at the House of Commons in February 2015, where trans women were addressed as \"Sir\" by members of security staff. The incident was subsequently brought to the attention of the Westminster authorities by Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, who raised the matter in the House. The staff were employed by the Metropolitan Police Service, and John Thurso, the Minister speaking on behalf of the Westminster authorities, said that the matter had been referred to the Met: \"It is taking this extremely seriously and we have made it clear to the Met how seriously we take it\".[4]\nMuston was selected as Labour's candidate for the East Park ward in February 2016, following the deselection of the previous incumbent, Payal Bedi.[5]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of transgender people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Meet the transgender ex-soldier who is now a Wolverhampton councillor\".

From 1986 to 1993, he attended Vinters Boys School, described as \"a living hell\", and Chatham Grammar School for Boys.[1] 1993-97,  attended Canterbury College of Art for Foundation and BA in Fine Art, but was forced to leave by the Department of Social Security.[1] From 1997 to 1998,  resumed a part-time BA, but was expelled for condemning \"conceptual shit\" and also threatened with arrest.[1]  Since then, No\u00eb has worked in their father's garage, Medway Citroen.[1]  During this time they returned to studies at Canterbury Christ Church College, and obtained a Master in Fine Arts degree in 2011.\nIn 1996, No\u00eb's work was first publicly exhibited in Indo Gothic, in Chatham, Kent. In 2000,  took part in the first Stuckist demonstration against the Turner Prize outside Tate Britain.[2] In 2001 founded the Maidstone Stuckists group and was exhibited in the Vote Stuckist show that year.[1] There were staged fourteen shows of the Maidstone Stuckists works in various venues, including pubs, libraries and the Maidstone Music School, as well as arranging expeditions of the group for \"painting, inspiration and getting drunk\".[1] In 2004, No\u00eb's work was included in The Stuckists Punk Victorian at the Walker Art Gallery for the 2004 Liverpool Biennial.[3]\nNo\u00eb has a hatred of cities, but does frequent Gothic nightclubs in London,[1]  and likes to spend time exploring Kent and researching European mythology. Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology are recurring themes in  paintings, as are historical sites and the countryside in Kent. The use of sacred geometry and their own form of aesthetic geometry are features in the work. The colour and texture of some work \"evokes a kind of modern Impressionism.\"[4]\nNo\u00eb is transgender and has suffered from gender dysphoria for their whole life \"diving into mythic history to distance myself from the feeling I had about myself\"[5] and has received hormone treatment since 2010 from Charing Cross Hospital's gender identity clinic.\n\nNotes and references[edit]\n R\u00e9my No\u00eb (dark glasses, background right) at the first Stuckist demonstration against the Turner Prize, 2000\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h Milner, Frank ed.

Nuntita was part of a TV show called Venus Flytrap Search for the Missing Puzzle in 2007. As one of twelve contestants, she competed to take the place of two former cast members. Nuntita and another contestant named Mew won the competition and became part of the Kathoey band Venus Flytrap. She became popular after a performance during her audition on Thailand's Got Talent and became a YouTube hit when she first performed singing as a girl, and the crowd was amazed when she switched to a masculine voice.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n2 Thailand's Got Talent\n3 Discography\n4 Filmography\n\n4.1 Film\n\n\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAlthough transsexuality is fairly well-accepted in Thailand, life as Bell was not exactly easy. In a Thai TV interview, she said it was very difficult to explain her gender identity to her family. As the only child of a military father, she faced many challenges to be accepted. However, today her family has accepted her and she is happy.[citation needed]\nShe has absolute pitch.[3]\n\nThailand's Got Talent[edit]\nNuntita was convinced to audition for Thailand's Got Talent by Anucha \"Chi\" Lanprasert, a talent scout. It was Nuntita's idea to surprise the crowd by first singing in a middleweight contralto voice before switching to a masculine baritone midway through the audition. In an April episode of the show, the judges picked Nuntita to be one of 48 semi-finalists. She received the second most votes in the semi-final round, and was thus subject to the three judges' determining votes. She passed to the final round by receiving \"yes\" votes from two of the three judges. Her first remixed song on the show's audition stage was a combination of \"Yahk Roo Tae Mai Yahk Taam\" by Calories Blah Blah and \"Unlovable\" by MILD, two popular Thai tunes. The three-minute song displayed Nuntita's choice of song style, mixing different genres and vocal ranges. After Nuntita's audition video appeared on YouTube and other sites, the video quickly went viral. She is sometimes dubbed as Thailand's version of Scottish singer Susan Boyle.[4]\nNuntita appeared on multiple Thai talk shows and had many nationally televised performances. She has appeared in TV shows such as Mum Show hosted by Petchtai Wongkamlao where she spoke of her gender transition. She said she participated in the army conscription lottery but did not draw the commission to enlist in Thailand's army.

According to Patrick Califia she \"should be credited as a forerunner of transgender direct action groups.\"[1] She is a software engineer.[2]\n\nTransgender activism[edit]\nOgborn was an early practitioner of direct action in support of transgender rights.[1]  For instance, in 1991, transsexual woman Nancy Burkholder was expelled from the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, a preeminent lesbian event.  Ogborn coordinated a direct action, Camp Trans, to protest the transphobia of the festival leaders.[1]\nThe first transsexual organization that Ogborn founded was KCGS, the Kansas City Gender Society.  Ogborn started Transgender Nation,[3] the transgender focus group of Queer Nation in San Francisco which included a new transgender caucus to fight transphobia in local debates.[4] In 1993, Ogborn and Transgender Nation members protested the American Psychiatric Association's listing of transsexualism as a psychiatric disorder, and medical colonization of transsexual people's lives.[5]\nOgborn was an early participant and organizer of the New Womens Conference, a retreat for post-operative transsexual women. She edited its newsletter, \"Rights of Passage\", which would later become the Transsexual News Telegraph.[6] Her involvement with the New Womens Conference informed much of her later work.\nOgborn joined the Hijra community[7] in 1994.\nShe continues her activism for transgender and human rights.[8]\n\nSee also[edit]\nGay pride\nQueer\nQueer Nation\nSan Francisco\nTransphobia\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Patrick Califia (18 September 2013).

The premise was inspired by a comments-section thread on a piece Cliffe had written for The Awl; on Cliffe's review of Gone With the Wind, a commenter wrote that their experience in the South was nearly identical to the novel \"except everybody has cellphones\", prompting him to imagine how Scarlett O'Hara might have used a cell phone.[21]\n\nThe Merry Spinster[edit]\nLavery is also the author of the short story collection The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror (Henry Holt, 2018).[22][23] The book, his second release, was highly anticipated, with Publishers Weekly, Bustle, The A.V. Club and InStyle Australia all naming it to lists of best forthcoming titles in 2018.[24][25][26][27]\nThe Merry Spinster reinvents archetypal fairy tales like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast; in the Los Angeles Times, Agatha French described his renderings as making the \"stories both weirder and yet somehow more familiar\".[17]\n\nSomething That May Shock and Discredit You[edit]\nLavery's third book, Something That May Shock and Discredit You, was published in February 2020 by Simon & Schuster.[28] The book is a memoir written as a collection of essays.[29]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nLavery identifies as queer.[5] In February 2018, he spoke to Autostraddle about the process of gender transitioning while writing The Merry Spinster.[30] In March 2018, he was interviewed by Heather Havrilesky in New York magazine's The Cut about coming out as trans.[31]\nIn November 2018, he and partner Grace Lavery, Associate Professor of English at UC Berkeley,[32][33] announced their intention to marry.[34] They were married on December 22, 2019.[35][36]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Chatner, The Shatner. \"A Halloween Compendium From The DMO-L Archives\". www.shatnerchatner.com.\n\n^ @evilmallelis (March 12, 2018). \"ok @CharoShane and I talked about breakfast and it was very exciting to 1. talk about breakfast and 2. bust out a sneak preview of the new name & shiny pronouns\".

It was there that Potts was exposed to evaporated mercury in an engine room aboard the ship, and was offered an honorable discharge after failing to get treatment.  She now lives off of Social Security disability benefits.[2]\nAfter her discharge Potts reportedly married and fathered a child, before divorcing in 2003.  After the divorce, Potts began living as a woman full-time, and while she began her transition by taking supplements to alter her body's hormones to be more female, she underwent conventional hormone therapy.[3]\nShe unsuccessfully ran in Missouri's primary for the 7th District Congressional seat[4] as a Republican in 2006 against incumbent Republican Congressman Roy Blunt.  Potts received 4294 votes which equated to 7.2 percent of the vote in the Republican primary in the southwest Missouri district. \nPotts announced on June 27, 2009, that she would run for the seat being vacated by retiring senator Kit Bond in 2010.[5] Potts had no recordable votes in that election.[6] On March 23, 2015, Potts announced on Facebook possibly seeking another attempt at the Senate seat by stating \"Last week, I made an announcement on several Green Party Fb pages stating that I have firmly decided to NOT SEEK THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION in 2016, and instead will most likely run for US Senator against Republican incumbant [sic], Roy Blunt, in my home state of Missouri.\"[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Midge Potts seeks change\".

She was the founding editor of TransGriot, a blog focusing on issues pertaining to trans women, particularly African-American and other women of color. Roberts' coverage of transgender homicide victims in the United States is credited for bringing national attention to the issue.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career and activism\n3 Awards and recognition\n4 Personal life and death\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nRoberts was born and raised in segregated Houston, Texas. Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father was a DJ. Roberts graduated from Jones High School in the Houston Independent School District in 1980.[2][3] In 1984, she graduated from the University of Houston.[3]\n\nCareer and activism[edit]\nRoberts was working in Houston as an airline gate agent in 1993\u201394 when she began her gender transition.[4] She was a founding member of the National Transgender Advocacy Coalition, and served as its Lobby Chair from 1999 to 2002.[5][6] In Louisville, Kentucky, Roberts served on the board of the Fairness Campaign and its political action committee C-FAIR. In 2005 and 2006, she organized the Transsistahs-Transbrothas Conference that took place in that city.[6]\nShe began writing TransGriot in 2004 as a newspaper column for The Letter, a Louisville-based LGBT newspaper;[7][8] the term \"griot\" refers to a storyteller from West Africa.[8] Roberts founded the TransGriot blog in 2006.[5][9] Roberts was motivated by a lack of trans blogs focused on black people and other people of color.[9][8] One of the missions of her blog is to \"chronicle the history of Black transpeople\".[6] The blog allowed her to address community issues in a more timely manner and allowed greater control than the column after it was taken away due to a conflict with an advertiser over her writing.[10] Through TransGriot, Roberts also identified transgender homicide victims in order to tribute the victims, many of whom are often misgendered in police reporting and media coverage.[11] Roberts' coverage of transgender homicides is credited for bringing national attention to the issue.[12]\nAs a black trans woman, Roberts has explored the intersections of cissexism and racism in her writing. In a 2009 column, she stated that people who have a problem with the word cisgender \"are wailing in unacknowledged cisgender privilege\", and compared this criticism to white people that \"call me 'racist' anytime I criticize the underlying structural assumptions that buttress whiteness\".[13]\n\nAwards and recognition[edit]\nIn 2006, Roberts won the IFGE Trinity Award for meritorious service to the transgender community; it was the transgender community's highest meritorious service award, and she was the first African-American Texan and the third African-American openly trans person to be given the award.[6] In 2015, Roberts received the Virginia Prince Transgender Pioneer Award from Fantasia Fair, making her the first African-American openly trans person to be so honored.[5][14]\nIn 2016, Roberts received a Special Recognition Award from GLAAD,[15] and became the first openly trans person to receive Phillips Brooks House Association's Robert Coles \"Call of Service\" Award.[16][14] In 2017, Roberts received the HRC John Walzel Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign.[14]\nIn 2018, she was named one of \"8 Houston Women to Watch on Social Media\" by Houstonia.[17] and won Outstanding Blog at the GLAAD Media Awards.[18] In January 2020, Roberts received the Susan J Hyde Award for Longevity in the Movement from the National LGBTQ Task Force.[19] In June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, Queerty named her among the fifty heroes \"leading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people\".[20][21]\n\nPersonal life and death[edit]\nRoberts began her gender transition in 1993\u201394.[9][4]  She had felt since she was five or six that \"something was different about me\", but didn't have access to black trans role models at that time (the 1970s); she felt that she would have transitioned earlier if she had.[9][7]\nRoberts died on October 5, 2020.[22][23][24] Her death was announced on October 8, 2020, in a Facebook post by her friend Dee Dee Watters, and was later confirmed by the Harris County Medical Examiner and local media.[25] Roberts' death was initially reported as a hit and run case, though the medical examiner later stated that the cause of death was a \"medical emergency\"; her family reported that she was feeling unwell in the days prior to her death.[26] The following week, the medical examiner reported the cause of death was complications of a pulmonary embolism.[27]\nMany LGBT activists, writers, and other celebrities paid tribute to Roberts via social media following the announcement of her death, including Janet Mock,[28] Raquel Willis,[29] Jen Richards,[30] Darnell L. Moore,[31] and Human Rights Campaign president Alphonso David.[32]\n\nSee also[edit]\nHistory of African Americans in Houston\nLGBT culture in Houston\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Monica Roberts' 2006 Trinity Acceptance Speech\". ifge.org.

Truett Theological Seminary in 2007.[19] After transitioning to present as female in 2007, in 2008 she visited West Point and addressed some cadets.[16]\nIn 2008 she joined the HRC Foundation, where as their first Deputy Director for Employee Programs she oversaw HRC's program to create model curricula for LGBT diversity training in the workplace. She remained there before assuming her role as executive director in 2012.[1]\nShe has been a member of the board of directors of several advocacy groups, including the International Foundation for Gender Education, the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists, and Knights Out.[20]\nIn October 2012 she became the first executive director of OutServe-SLDN, a network of LGBT actively serving military personnel, following the merger of OutServe and Servicemembers Legal Defense Network.[9][10][11] She was the first transgender person to ever lead a national LGBT rights organization that does not have an explicit transgender focus.[12]\nThe group was in the process of losing much of its funding base after the official September 2011 repeal of Don't ask, don't tell (DADT), the official United States policy on banning and expelling gays serving in the military enacted in 1993.[3][4][21][22][23] Robinson was tasked with bridging the two former groups, and reworking a shrinking budget, having to lay off half the new groups' staff. Nine months after hiring her, OutServe-SLDN's board announced it was bankrupt and had to close its Washington D.C. headquarters; on the same day, Robinson announced that her resignation as executive director would take effect the following day, July 12, 2013.[7][8]\nIn 2014, Calvary Baptist Church in Washington ordained her to the gospel ministry.[24]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRobinson has been married to Danyelle Robinson since 1994.

She is also known for her performance as Angel in the 2011 Off-Broadway revival of Rent, for which she won the 2011 Clive Barnes Award.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Stage acting origins\n2.2 Transition and reemergence\n2.3 Breakthrough and after\n\n\n3 Filmography\n\n3.1 Film\n3.2 Television\n\n\n4 Theatre\n5 Awards and nominations\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nMj Rodriguez was born on January 7, 1991, in Newark, New Jersey to an African-American mother and an African-American and Puerto Rican father.[2][3] Rodriguez attended the Queen of Angels Catholic School.[4] Although she wanted to become an actress since the age of seven, she only began pursuing the profession at the age of 11 after her mother enrolled her in the New Jersey Performing Arts Center\u2014where she became an eight-year veteran of the program and participated in its New Jersey Youth Theater program.[5][6]\nWhile she had \"prayed to become female\" beginning at age 7, Rodriguez states that she was in denial for many years and initially came out to her parents as \"bisexual/gay\" at the age of 14.[5][7] At 14, Rodriguez became involved in the ballroom scene where she found support from her house father who taught her to vogue.[8][9] She is a graduate of Newark Arts High School,[10] and later attended Berklee College of Music, where she was a 2009 Star-Ledger scholarship recipient and a 2009 Young Arts first level scholarship recipient.[6] She eventually took the stage name \"MJ\" Rodriguez after the Marvel Comics character Mary Jane \"MJ\" Watson, being a self-described comic book geek and from putting the letters together from parts of her birth name.[2][11]\n\nCareer[edit]\nStage acting origins[edit]\nWhile attending college, Rodriguez was cast in a theater production of Rent as Angel Dumott Schunard. Rodriguez had wanted to play the role since first seeing the 2005 film adaptation.[2][5][7] She connected with actress Fredi Walker-Browne (the actress who originated the Broadway role of Joanne Jefferson in Rent) who was in attendance at one of Rodriguez's performances. Walker-Browne asked Rodriguez to read for the part of Angel and helped her to land an audition in an upcoming off-Broadway production of Rent.[7] Rodriguez was cast for the role in the off-Broadway production, and acted alongside then-up and coming stage actor Annaleigh Ashford (cast as Maureen).[6] Rodriguez' performance garnered her the 2011 Clive Barnes Award that was established in honor of the late English writer and critic Clive Barnes.[6]\n\nTransition and reemergence[edit]\nIt was during this period, Rodriguez began to fully explore the transitioning process. Following the conclusion of the off-Broadway revival in 2012, Rodriguez made the decision to go on hiatus to begin transition. Beginning with hormone replacement therapy in early 2016, [7] and allowing sufficient time for privacy, MJ Rodriguez reemerged to start a new chapter as a female actress. Rodriguez then contacted her representation to inform them that she was no longer auditioning for male roles.[7] Despite her concerns, Rodriguez found her representation to be fully supportive of her new gender identity.[7]\nFrom 2012\u20132016, Rodriguez appeared in small television roles, including Nurse Jackie, The Carrie Diaries, and Luke Cage.[12] Her 2016 appearance in the non-speaking role of \"Sister Boy\" on Luke Cage also marked the first appearance of both a transgender actress and character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[13]\nFollowing her reemergence, Rodriguez uploaded a video of herself on Facebook singing the number \"Satisfied\" from the Broadway musical Hamilton. The video received a positive response and landed her an invitation to audition for the role of Peggy Schuyler/Maria Reynolds in Hamilton.[7] The news of her audition as a trans-actress for a cisgender role made various Broadway and LGBT news outlets.[7][14] She then appeared in several additional stage productions:\n\nEncores! Off-Center's 2016 production of Runaways[15]\nThe 2016 off-Broadway premiere of Street Children by Pia Skala-Zankel at the New Ohio Theatre[16]\nThe American Repertory Theater's 2017 production of Trans Scripts: Part 1, The Women at the Loeb Drama Center[17]\nThe 2017 world premier of the synth-pop musical Burn All Night in the Oberon at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge[18]\nRodriguez also landed a supporting role in the independent film Saturday Church as Ebony. The 2017 film, which premiered in January 2018, depicted a runaway teenager exploring their gender identity and becoming involved in the contemporary underground ball culture scene. Her portrayal of Ebony earned her a nomination for Best Actress at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival.[19]\n\nBreakthrough and after[edit]\nIn 2017, Rodriguez was cast in the leading role of Blanca Rodriguez-Evangelista in the FX series Pose following a six-month casting search.[20] The show was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Steven Canals and made history by casting five transgender actresses in leading roles. As of 2018, the show features the largest cast of transgender actors as series regulars in a scripted series. [8][21] The pilot for Pose went into production in November 2017 and premiered in June 2018 to positive reviews.[21][22][23]\nThe series is set in New York City during the 1980s and explores the lives of queer people of color (specifically black trans women) who are involved with the underground ballroom scene. Rodriguez's Blanca is a young woman who forms her own \"house\"\u2014the House of Evangelista\u2014after receiving a positive diagnosis for HIV. As the head of the House of Evangelista, she becomes a surrogate mother to several abandoned queer youth of color.[24] Described as a \"breakout, starring role,\"[19][25] her performance has been praised by critics.[25][26][27][28] Among the show's regular cast are Rodriguez's Saturday Church co-star Indya Moore, Tony Award-winner Billy Porter, model Dominique Jackson, trans rights advocate Angelica Ross, Evan Peters, Kate Mara, and James Van Der Beek.\nRodriguez performed with Pose co-stars Dyll\u00f3n Burnside, Billy Porter and Ryan Jamaal Swain in a benefit concert on July 23, 2018, to celebrate the season 1 finale and raise money for GLSEN and sing \"Waving Through a Window\" from Dear Evan Hansen.[29][30][31]\nIn 2019 Rodriguez became the first openly transgender woman to win Best Actress - Television at the Imagen Awards.[32]\nIn the fall of 2019, Rodriguez played Audrey, the leading lady in Pasadena Playhouse's production of Little Shop of Horrors, becoming the first transgender woman of color to play the role in a major production. Her cast mates included George Salazar (from Broadway's Be More Chill) as Seymour and Amber Riley (Glee) as Audrey II. About the role she told Broadway.com, \"I\u2019m simply an actress. I think any woman should be considered for this role. [My casting] shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s trending\u2014it should be normal.\"[33]\nOn October 1, 2019, she and Little Shop of Horror's co-star George Salazar were the musical guests on The Late Late Show with James Corden on CBS where they performed \"Suddenly Seymour.\" [34]\nIn November 2019, Rodriguez landed a contract with Olay Body, becoming the first Latina trans woman to enter a partnership with the company.[35]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2017\n\nSaturday Church\n\nEbony\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nBun in the Oven\n\nBertha\n\nShort film\n\n\n2018\n\nGema\n\nGema\n\nShort film\n\n\n2018\n\nThe Big Take\n\nRobyn\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nAdam\n\nEmma\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nDisclosure: Trans Lives on Screen\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary film\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2012\n\nNurse Jackie\n\nLonna\n\nEpisode: \"No-Kimono-Zone\"\n\n\n2013\n\nThe Carrie Diaries\n\nFabulous Clubgoer #2\n\nEpisode: \"Read Before Use\"\n\n\n2016\n\n[Blank] My Life\n\nKerry\n\nEpisode: \"Mr. Owl\"\n\n\n2016\n\nLuke Cage\n\nSister Boy\n\nEpisode: \"Manifest\"\n\n\n2018\u2013present\n\nPose\n\nBlanca Rodriguez\n\n18 episodes\n\nTheatre[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nProduction\n\nRole\n\nLocation\n\nCategory\n\n\n2011\n\nRent\n\nAngel\n\nNew World Stages\n\nOff-Broadway\n\n\n2016\n\nRunaways\n\nPixie\n\nEncores!

In this volunteer organization, she was initially the Secretary of the Foundation\u00b4s president. After a year, she began to connect with other NGO youth groups. She championed with other young LGBTI the processes related to sexual orientation and HIV/AIDS in the first bill of youth, promoted at the time by the \"house of youth\" of the old ministry of \"social welfare\" of Ecuador.\nAfter several years, she directly contacted the Kimirina Corporation to participate as a field researcher in the \"Needs Assessment\" in transgender populations[5] which would reaffirm their hypothesis of the situational state of transgender people in those years. The results of the study were shown publicly after a year.\nShe developed LGBT activist rights in Ecuador while she was in college studying Commercial Engineering, which she left in her 2nd year due to bullying at the various companies where she worked.\n\nCommunity-based organization[edit]\nIn 2006, with the support of the \"transgender project\" of Quito, she created in the city of Guayaquil the community-based organization (CBO): \"Future Community\", an organization that focuses on specialized local activism for gender identity. This proposal arose from the confusion and the need of its founders to separate the issues: sexual orientation  and gender identity. The organization failed after six months due to \"GayPatriarchy - gaytriarcado\" (a term coined by Diane Rodriguez in 2012[6]) that made their work illegitimate.\n\nSilueta X[edit]\nAfter serving for 26 years,  she created the girl group \"Silhouette X\" (Silueta X), whose name comes from the questioning before the system Kish - Straight. The activities of this group had such an impact that they had an interview in the Daily Spectator[7] of Colombia that discussed trans and intersex activism in Ecuador.\nIn 2010 the project \"Social inclusion of young transgender people to be trained in micro-enterprises, decreasing poverty, sex work and proliferation HIV/AIDS\" was approved, which gave the opportunity to legally register the organization and pass the \"Girl Group Silhouette X\" to \"Silueta X Association\".\n\nKidnapping[edit]\nThis section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources. Please help by adding reliable sources. Contentious material about living people that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately.Find sources:\u00a0\"Diane Marie Rodr\u00edguez Zambrano\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0news\u00a0\u00b7 newspapers\u00a0\u00b7 books\u00a0\u00b7 scholar\u00a0\u00b7 JSTOR (September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn February 2012, she was kidnapped for four hours after leaving the \"Silueta X\" offices. The criminals knew Diane Rodriguez and her work. The event was strategically planned, and four months later she received a call indicating that the next time she would not go unscathed.\nThe financial loss was not a serious injury compared with the attempts to rape she suffered[clarification needed]. This experience almost cost her her life, was reported in the respective state attorney general's office of the city of Guayaquil. She suffered from PTSD for almost two months.\n\nActivism[edit]\nIncidence work[edit]\nIn 2008, while working in the \"Hotel Oro Verde\" of Guayaquil, she was unexpectedly fired by the hotel chain. Although it was the 3rd company that had done this to Diane Rodriguez, she had never filed a legal complaint due to a lack of knowledge of the laws, which allowed her to file a legal complaint against the company for employment discrimination. It is speculated that it was employment discrimination because the day before the group Silueta X developed a panel with the Kimirina Corporation and the \"Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion of Ecuador\" entitled: \"Increasing HIV/AIDS awareness in transgender youth\" and the event \"the transgender and their capabilities\", held at the zonal government of Guayaquil. The events were covered by various media and Diane Rodriguez publicly participated (at that time as a transvestite). Diane Rodriguez followed a legal process to sue the hotel, creating a precedent in the Ecuador, in which an LGBT individual filed a discrimination lawsuit against a private company.[citation needed]\nThe legal battle continued until 2009. Rodriguez was not seeking damages or compensation, but only to be reinstated to her old job as a cashier, and have her gender identity respected at work. Public hearings from the ombudsman and the hotel were prolonged, but indicated that they could not accept it because her self-identification as a woman did not match her legal identity.[citation needed]\n\nLegal advocacy[edit]\nThe legal requirements of the hotel to reinstate her to work drove her to implement the campaign: \"Females with Female Names\", unleashing the legal implications of trans issues interest in this country. The \"Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador\" of 2008 in its favor; which first entered the \"gender identity\" initiates a legal complaint against the \"civil status\" because it denies the request to change their names from male to female.\nHer second legal battle resulted in her favor, after several internal adjustments of the \"Civil Registration\" with the Ombudsman in February 2009,[8] making this achievement in the first legal precedent in the Republic of Ecuador [9] in transgender identity. A law was created to establish access for transgender, transsexual and intersex people to change their names masculine to feminine or vice versa.\nAfter partially meeting the legal demands of the hotel company, she continued with the first-filed legal complaint, ignoring the change of its female names for later testify in open court, that the hotel had economic problems and was downsizing. This stalled the process of the employment discrimination complaint because they could not incorporate it to work, by economic arguments. The hotel promised to locate another company for Diane Rodriguez, but that never materialized. Later, another complaint was presented to the Ombudsman's Office, where it was found that the hotel, months after the legal process, was in search of new cashiers to work in the same hotel company. The case continues and is still open, and there is no legal resolution from the Ombudsman's Office of Ecuador.\nCompleting this year, through a protective action against the Civil Registration, other legal process starts on this occasion to demand recognition of their female gender identity, sponsored by the Ombudsman's Office. However, months after she was denied the action for defense by the first civil court. The judicial record of the complaint, after this result, instead of continuing to the provincial court, stagnates when dilated by the Ombudsman's Office, lost her case for sex change in the identity card, after a couple of years.[10][11]\n\nImpact Media[edit]\n Diane Rodriguez protesting the sexist structures\nFor the first time, after having had a bad report with the Extra Journal in 2009 with the headline \"I'm going to marry a black and adopt 3 children\" whereby Diane Rodriguez, made public its complaint against daily, comes to terms with it, to make \"positive reports Silueta X\" which initially started nine transgender members of Silueta X, with points in the photographic studio of the Journal, and subsequently standardized good stories, not only in that environment, but it influenced the context.[12]\nThe initial aim was to position the trans issue within the country through the medium of communication was most widely read as this environment, achieving in this way the visibility of activities inherent to LGBTI issues, like no other media had done. Later an awards ceremony, where the biggest winner was the medium who had previously had disputes were made.[13]\n\nImpact on authorities[edit]\n Diane Rodriguez, protesting against one of the state apparatus.\nIn developing the 2010 complained to the authorities and had media uptake on Census population of INEC (National Institute of Statistics and Censuses) of Ecuador, due to the lack of advice and unwillingness register in the same populations LGBTI, especially those transgender, that having been born in one sex living in another genre. The trans and intersex endpoint was great demand as identified as the man born and live as women or vice versa, is to falsify information. The demands sustained that trans and intersex people do not belong to either, getting lost in that census the opportunity to make a statistic LGBTI.[14] In the same year, conducted the study \"Psycho- social about sex work among transgender and transsexual youth 15 to 29 years in the city of Guayaquil during 2010\",[15] which had an impact locally. Regarding their results, due to the approach to prostitution trans[16]\nIt lapsing 2011 Diane Rodriguez, got the attention of the Ministry of Interior and police community, by proposing a joint effort with the transgender population. The approach, part from the various complaints of trans partners who performed sex work, who expressed the abuse of some policemen. Thus begins the inter-institutional agreements with the authorities and get to the first \"awareness workshops in sexuality and g\u00e9nero\",[17] in order to reduce stigma and discrimination against prostitutes and transgender sex workers in Guayaquil.[18]\n\nSocial impact[edit]\nVictor Victoria[edit]\nIn 2009, with several organizations led by Kimirina corporation, Diane Rodriguez gave life to the first comics or preventive character transgender, which she called \"Victor Victoria\".[19]\nThe magazine was intended to give the necessary attention to the transgender population in the different aspects of everyday life such as health, education, employment, violence, including trans specificities. Publication of the journal was kept for two years in a row, reaching the trans population in general.[20]\n\nMy gender My ID card[edit]\nLaunches \"My gender campaign in my ID Card (Mi G\u00e9nero Mi C\u00e9dula in Spanish)\",[21] with the Project Transgender, CONFETRANS, Peppermint Foundation, Articulation feminist building equality and Silueta X Association, in order to land the Article 11 paragraph 2 of the constitution of the Republic of Ecuador on reforms to the Act Civil Registration. Such demands for gender identity, born after a legal complaint filed the civil registry for sex change in the identity, then the Ombudsman of Quito, indicated that his proceedings against the registry so that your gender is recognized in the identity card was lost, dilation[22]\nThe \"My gender on my identity card\" campaign - a point of exercising citizenship, had a positive impact on the Ecuadorian context and in the assembly, which in the first instance the whole, the bill passed with 75% in favor in December 2012.[23] However, now the bill is suspended, with the possibility to be vetoed. This new panorama, born to confusion by far-right groups with the theme of gay marriage, which although is another important topic for LGBTI, had nothing to do whatsoever with the amendments to the Act Civil Registry.\n\nIt's time for equality[edit]\nLaunch the campaign in June 2013, \"It's time for equality, for freedom from discrimination Ecuador (Es tiempo de Igualdad, por un Ecuador Libre de Discriminaci\u00f3n in Spanish)\", which aims to reduce stigma and discrimination in the country. Thanks to this campaign several complaints like Zulema Constant, Sara Sol\u00f3rzano and Dennise Freire, related to LGBTI torture clinics or homosexualization, in an attempt of sexual diversity groups, stop the violence and torture emerge ellos.[24]\n\nLGBTI Medical Center[edit]\nIn May 2013 launched the first psycho - medical for gays, lesbians, bisexual, intersex, and transgender people in Ecuador. Her teammates in honor of her work called her \"Diane Rodriguez\" [25] at a public event with safe and state authorities. This safe center is the first of its kind because it has specialized for LGBTI groups especially on the issue of gender identity medicine, which has been evident for years its lack of attention, including at mundial.[26] and also with psychological support, issues of diversity sexual.[27]\n\nAdvocacy[edit]\nCivil disobedience[edit]\nDeclares May 7, 2011 in \"civil disobedience\", to be selected by the CNE-National Electoral Board as 3rd Member of the Board #137 of Men[28] to be violent their right to sexual privacy and the free development of his personality. Your claim arises from the refusal of the CNE, not relocate at a meeting of women. The public response from the CNE, do not satisfy the expectations of an activist being forced to self- declare in civil disobedience.[29]\n\nBoard males[edit]\nIn February 2013 her gender was denied when expected to vote while designated as a man.[30][31][32] Despite being the 2nd time the CNE did not pay attention to her claims, this time defrayed with the same arrogance that led her political campaign as the first transgender candidate in that country.[33][34]\n\nPolitical rally[edit]\nMovement Political Alianza Pa\u00eds[edit]\nThis section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources.

The directory is part of this movement, even legally for registration with the national electoral council for the province of Guayas.\n\nCandidacy[edit]\n Diane Rodriguez Zambrano transsexual activist and representative LGBTI in Ecuador\nIn October 2012, the general assembly of \"Ruptura 25\", is nominated in the primaries as a possible candidate for the province of Guayas. This was completed during the nominations of candidates for that month to the delegate \"Electoral National Council\" who voted for her nomination unanimously. Leaves the country for an emergency which causes problems for her candidacy to be denied registration by the CNE (National Electoral Council) for \"legal uncertainty\", introducing the authorized copy of the identity card, and witness the institution of male and female names. With original documents, members of \"Ruptura 25\", managed to enroll no more drawbacks Diane Rodriguez raised that, while ignoring the legal uncertainty now reveal the identity of the activist, having female names with gender masculino.[35][36] Diane Rodriguez led a campaign with few resources receiving external support as spots, videos, etc... motivated by the activism.[37][38]\n\nStrife policy[edit]\nDuring the political campaign, she had several impasses with the presidential candidate and evangelist Nelson Zavala, who repeatedly dismissed her participation, for reasons ranging from the more fundamentalist to religious.[39] In view of the different statements against Conservative candidate Diane Rodriguez, the national electoral Council developed a contingency plan which includes \"hate crimes\" during the campaign. Thus, the electoral body was still on the presidential candidate process judicial[40][41] candidate against Nelson Zavala, culminating in the elimination of its civil rights and politicians within one year and pay a fine 3120 dollars.[42][43] This achievement, the first of its kind in Latin America became well regarded, it even won a contest in international law, as the first of its kind.[44]\n\nResults[edit]\n ID card and male picture of Diane Rodriguez\nAt the end of the campaign, Diane Rodriguez defrayed in row of men, despite their public claims to the CNE to make it meet the standard of women.[45][46]\nThe official results of the political movements were declared on March 15, 2013, where it was confirmed that anyone candidate of the movement \"Ruptura 25\", was able to secure a seat for the assembly, including of course Diane Rodr\u00edguez.[47] The political movement of the government \"Alianza Pais\", won more than 100 seats in the assembly,[48] reaching an overwhelming majority in the new period terminating on 2017.\n\nPresidency of Ecuador[edit]\nMessage from the President[edit]\nOn March 19, 2013, after her candidacy and again and completely dedicated to civil activism, reelected president Rafael Correa Delgado, sent a tweet the transgender ex-candidate Assemblywoman, which expressed \"Dear Diane, I just wanted to say that I admire and respect deeply, but do not share all its principles.\"[49][50][51]\n\nInvitation president[edit]\nIn May 2013, a special treat, which makes the president of Ecuador to the first activist LGBTI for change the \"Presidential Guard\" from his new period, a civic act of high importance, in particular Carondelet.[52]\n\nThe Historical Meeting LGBTI[edit]\nDuring the invitation by President Rafael Correa to Diane Rodriguez in May 2013, she used the space to request a private meeting and expose the situational status of the population LGBTI of Ecuador. This particular meeting was the December 13, 2013, where the protocol activist jumped and took 8 reps of various conditions sex - Generic and various organizations and provinces of Ecuador, thus consecrating, \"The Historical Meeting LGBTI between President Rafael Correa and the Collective of diversity Sexual\".[53]\nThis meeting concluded agreements essential for justice, health, education, and employment[54] for the populations of the diversity of Ecuador, which eventually went from a situational exposure to specific agreements. Some activists, particularly Homosexuals (Gays and Lesbians) Diane Rodriguez criticized for not having proposed \"Equal Marriage\" which from the perspective of the activist is a populist issue and contributes little to the basic needs of people variously sexuality.[55] It is noteworthy that the position of Diane Rodriguez is the deconstruction of the capitalist system, which prevents him from defending the \"Equal Marriage\" as a right, as she thinks more of its abolition.[56]\nThis revolutionary ideology of Diane Rodriguez is similar to that of Beatriz Preciado, Spanish philosopher recognized that contemporary criticism has broad claims, such as Gay Marriage: \u00abThe demand for legalization of gay marriage comes indirectly strengthen marriage as a condition of access to citizenship. Similarly, institutional programs to combat so-called \"gender violence\" contribute to the naturalization of the relationship between violence and masculinity, masking their own violence to marital and family structures (which are further reinforced by the demands of gay marriage)\u00bb.[57]\n\n Historic Meeting with President Rafael Correa of Ecuador, led by Diane Rodriguez\nThe Historic Meeting with President Rafael Correa and sexual diversity, had a profound impact within the LGBTI populations in Ecuador, of which several media published as successful,[58] and the president himself on the citizen bond Dec. 14 described it as productive.[59]\n\nDiscrimination vs. freedom of expression[edit]\nWith the recent approval in Communications Law Ecuador,[60] Diane Rodriguez becomes the stirring social[61] and the 33 common legal organizations[62] Afro -Ecuadorian, indigenous, local peasants, women, LGBTI, etc. to summon and create the National Platform of Human Rights,[63] for later file a legal complaint against comedy shows, entertainment, variety, etc.[64] that influence stigma and discrimination against these groups. The Ombudsman of Ecuador became the entity Shower[65] to the filed complaint. The Superintendency of Information and Communication SUPERCOM even produced a technical report.[66] After the complaint in its wake more organizations come together forming about 49 organizations[67] that support the legal process. Following this, the Actor David Reinoso, threatened the organization and activist [68] to initiate legal action against her,[69] of course, damage to the image of the comedy shows that produce.[70]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nShe is married to Fernando Machado, a South American transgender man.

Broughton High School.[9]\nSchafer is a trans woman, stating, \"I do like people to know that I'm not a cis girl because that's not something that I am or feel like I am.

Since then, she has released a dozen solo albums in a range of genres, including If We're Not Talking (2007), Keys & Machines (2009) and 1:1 (2011). Shraya has also created two albums, Bronze (2015) and Angry (2018), with her band, Too Attached, which she and her brother, Shamik Bilgi, formed in 2015. She has toured extensively in North America, both as a solo artist and with Too Attached, sharing the stage with Tegan and Sara,[5] Dragonette, Melanie C, Team Dresch, Melissa Ferrick, Brian Byrne, Greg MacPherson and Bonjay.[6]\nShraya's 2017 album, Part-Time Woman, a collaboration with the Queer Songbook Orchestra, was named one of the 17 best Canadian albums of 2017 by CBC Arts[7] and longlisted for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.[8]\n\nWriting[edit]\nIn 2010, Shraya published her first book, God Loves Hair,[9] an illustrated collection of twenty-one linked short stories about a brown, genderqueer child growing up in immigrant family in Alberta. God Loves Hair was nominated for a 2011 Lambda Literary Award in the Children's/Young Adult category. Shraya's second book, She of the Mountains, a lyrical novel consisting of two intertwined love stories, was named one of The Globe and Mail's Best 100 Books of 2014,[10] and nominated for a 2015 Lambda Literary Award. Shraya was awarded the Honour of Distinction at the 2015 Dayne Ogilvie Awards.[11]\nIn 2016, Shraya released her debut poetry collection, even this page is white, an incisive exploration of the effects of everyday racism and colonialism in Canada[12] that won a 2017 Publishing Triangle award[13] and was longlisted for CBC's Canada Reads.[14] The Boy & The Bindi, a children's picture book about a young boy's fascination with the dot on his mother's forehead, was also published in 2016. Shraya's first non-fiction book, I\u2019m Afraid of Men, was released in August 2018.[15]  \nIn 2017, Shraya partnered with Arsenal Pulp Press to create an imprint, VS. Books.[16] Through VS.

Shraya\u2019s narrative pushes back against the ways mainstream and pop-culture formulations of social justice are used to further agendas misaligned with principles of equity. It critiques the ways in which social-justice rhetoric can be wielded as a weapon for the purpose of self-aggrandizement or the pursuit of personal vendettas. The Subtweet attempts to nudge the reader toward a more critical perspective and to encourage the reader to be more skeptical of what comes out of the mouths of public figures, especially when money and politics are involved.\"[20]\n\nMedia and visual arts[edit]\nShraya has created five short films that have screened at festivals across Canada and internationally.[21][22] In 2016, she released a photo series, Trisha, featuring old photos of her mother displayed alongside contemporary re-creations of the images with Shraya herself as the subject.[23][24] This project has been shown in galleries across North America[25] and a digital version of Trisha has circulated internationally.\nShraya's first theatrical work debuted February 18, 2020.The work is called \"How to Fail as a Popstar,\" chronicling \"her journey to 'not quite' pop music superstardom. A reflection on the power of pop culture, dreams, disappointments and self-determination, this astonishing performance is a triumph in finding one\u2019s authentic voice.\"[26] The play includes original songs written and performed by Shraya. \n\nPersonal life[edit]\nOn February 15, 2016, Shraya came out as transgender[27] and announced via her Facebook account that she is now using the pronouns she and her.\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSamsara: The Sketches (2002)\nTHROAT EP (2003)\nA Composite of Straight Lines (2005)\nIf We're Not Talking (2007)\nIf We're Not Talking Single (2008)\nKeys & Machines (2009)\nPart Time Woman (2017)\nBooks[edit]\nGod Loves Hair (2010)\nShe of the Mountains (2014)\neven this page is white (2016)\nThe Boy & the Bindi (2016)\nI'm Afraid of Men (2018)\nDeath Threat (2019)\nThe Subtweet (2020)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Joy and rage meet in Anger, the second EP of sibling duo Too Attached\".

Silveira is credited as the first openly transgender man to have signed with a major record label.[5] He also writes about LGBTQ issues.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Career\n3 Activism\n4 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nSilveira was born in Canada to Portuguese parents and lived in Mississauga and attended local Catholic schools.[6] He considers himself Portuguese-Canadian and he lived in Portugal for 6 years in his youth and he speaks fluent Portuguese.[3]\nWhen he was a child, he knew he was a boy and asked his mother to buy him a penis like his brothers. Growing up, he identified as a lesbian. In 2004, he came out to himself, family, and friends as a transgender man.[6] In an interview published in The Advocate, Silveira states that he feels \"transgender by definition, but not by identity\", because being transgender has become a political identity rather than a personal one.[7]\nIn 2010 he began hormone replacement therapy.[8][9]\n\nCareer[edit]\nSilveira founded The Cliks in 2004[6] alongside Ezri Kaysen and Heidi Chan. While the lineup changed over the years, The Cliks have released four albums and with one of their songs appearing on the L Word Soundtrack and toured with Cyndi Lauper on the True Colours Tour.[6] On their fourth album, Black Tie Elevator (2013) Silveira worked producer The Weeknd and collaborator Hill Kourkoutis.[10] On TV Silveira appeared on MTV's Logo TV,[2] The Late Late Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live and in the documentrary film Riot Acts.[6]\nSilveira was the first openly transgender man signed to a major label in 2006, at the age of 33.[7][5] Before coming out as transgender, Silveira composed and performed folk music.[6] After coming out, however, he shifted his focus to rock music.[6] Describing his shift from folk to rock music, Silveira says, \"When I finally came out as being trans, I found myself freer to explore that darker, more hard-core side, and my songwriting started getting heavier and heavier.\"[6]\nIn 2007, The Toronto Star suggested that Silveira was about to become \"the first transgendered pop heartthrob ever to register on mainstream radar\u201d.[2] He was also voted as the \"sexiest Canadian man\" in Chart Attack's 15th Annual Readers' Poll making him the first trans man to win the award.[11]\nStarting in September 2009 and ending in April 2016, Silveira began releasing popular cover songs on Youtube. Starting with Wham!'s song \"Freedom\"[12] and also covered artists like Robyn, Kanye West, Lady Gaga and Justin Timberlake.[9] When asked why he started this project, he explained that he did it for the sake of \"doing a cover every like couple of weeks\u201d.[6] When his hormone replacement therapy began in 2010, viewers both began asking for recordings of the covers as well as asking questions about his changing voice. Silveira has not only been described as a role model for other transgender singers,[13] but his covers on Youtube \u201cenabled listening practices that reimagine engagement with contemporary musical archives and the temporality of trans experience.\u201d[12] However, upon reflecting on this early success with a major label, he was shocked that \"the band quickly hit a glass ceiling\" where the \"main focus wasn\u2019t on my music. It was very much on my gender identity.\"[5]\n\nActivism[edit]\nIn 2011, he appeared with Ian Harvie and Selene Luna, in Buck Angel's documentary Sexing the Transman, investigating the sexuality of transgender men and the change in their sexual behavior after they transitioned.[14]\nSilveira has written and published articles around LGBT identity, specifically transgender identity. In May 2013, Silveira published an article with HuffPost Music Canada titled \"I'm Trans, I Get Bullied, and I'm Fighting Back\", where he wrote about the bullying that he endures as a transgender man and how he has fought back.[15] In July 2015, Silveira published another article in HuffPost Living Canada titled \"Why We Need to Talk About Caitlyn Jenner.\" He expresses support for Jenner and transgender individuals around the world, while arguing that Jenner's story is one of privilege that many don't have. He ends the article by congratulating Jenner as well as transgender man Aydian Dowling, but emphasizes trying \"not to fall into the same pattern that others have before us and be mindful that there are so many amazing diverse people in our community who all need a voice to tell their stories.\"[16]\nIn 2016, Silveira wrote two pieces for SamaritanMag. His October 2016 article titled \"Filmmaker Captures Reactions of His Family and Friends in Coming Out Doc\", Silveira interviews Alden Peter on his documentary Coming Out. In the article, Silveria asks Peter about his desire to come out, vulnerability, and hopes for future projects.[17] In November 2016, Silveira published another article titled \"Q&A: Film Director Adam Garnet Jones Explores Unique First Nations Theme.\" He interviews Adam Garnet Jones on his LGBT drama Fire Song, two-spirit identity, and homophobia within First Nations communities.[18] Additionally, he has been interviewed by the CBC on Bill C-16 which introduced a Canadian law that added gender expression and gender identity as protected grounds to the Canadian Human Rights Act.[19]\nIn April 2017, Silveira published a piece on SamaritanMag titled \"Q&A: the Cliks\u2019 Lucas Silveira interviews Fellow Transgender Rock Singer Laura Jane Grace\". In the article, he interviews Grace on her experience publicly coming out, transitioning, and Grace's book, Tranny: Confessions Of Punk Rock\u2019s Most Infamous Anarchist Sell Out, and band, Against Me!.[20]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ \"Warner Music Canada LTD\".

As a young adult, she became close to British actress Dame Margaret Rutherford, who she considered an adoptive mother, and who was the subject of a biography Simmons wrote in later years.[4] After sex reassignment surgery in 1968, Simmons wed in the first legal interracial marriage in South Carolina.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Early career\n3 Move to South Carolina\n4 Marriage\n5 Later years and death\n6 In culture\n7 Bibliography\n8 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSimmons' parents were servants at Sissinghurst Castle, the English estate of biographer Harold Nicolson and his novelist wife, Vita Sackville-West.[5] Simmons was born in Sussex as Gordon Langley Hall to Jack Copper, Vita Sackville-West's chauffeur, and another servant, Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, before they were married.[5] Although she claimed to have been born with an unusual condition that resulted in the swelling of her genitals with the result that she was mistakenly identified as a boy, Charleston author Edward Ball's book Peninsula of Lies (2004) states that she was born male.[6]\nAs a child, Simmons was raised by her grandmother and at one point visited the castle and met Virginia Woolf, Sackville-West's lover.[5] Woolf made Sackville-West the subject of the novel Orlando: A Biography, which bears a striking resemblance to Simmons' own life story.[2]\n\nEarly career[edit]\nIn 1946 Simmons emigrated to Canada.[1] Still living as a man, she crewcut her hair and became a teacher on the Ojibway native reserve on Lake Nipigon, experiences from which were translated into the best-selling Me Papoose Sitter (1955)\u2014the first of many published books.[5]\nAfter a stint as an editor for the Winnipeg Free Press,[2] Simmons moved back to England in 1947, to teach theatre at the Gregg School in Croydon, Surrey.[1] She moved to the United States in 1950, and became the society editor for the Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri before moving to New York and working as the society editor of the Port Chester Daily Item.[1][2] Shortly after moving to New York, Simmons met artist Isabel Whitney, beginning a friendship that would last until Whitney's death in 1962.[1]\nDuring this time, Simmons began a prolific writing career, including a series of biographies which covered personalities such as Princess Margaret (1958), Jacqueline Kennedy (1964), Lady Bird Johnson (1967), and Mary Todd Lincoln (1970) among many more.[2] While living in Whitney's New York townhouse in the 1950s, Simmons was introduced to Margaret Rutherford and her husband Stringer Davis. Rutherford, interested in meeting Simmons to discuss a role in a possible adaptation of Me Papoose Sitter, became enamored with the young author and she and Davis agreed to serve as unofficial adoptive parents.[5] Subsequently, Simmons and Whitney purchased a house in Charleston, South Carolina, though Whitney would die two weeks later,[1] leaving Simmons the house and $2 million.[2]\n\nMove to South Carolina[edit]\nThe mansion Simmons purchased with Whitney, was located in the Ansonborough neighbourhood of Charleston, a neighbourhood known for housing the city's queer elite.[2][5] Simmons began restoring the house, and designed the interior with early American antiques and furniture by Thomas Chippendale.[2] Much later, shortly before her death, her pursuit of Chippendale pieces brought her into contact with Edward Ball, a journalist whose family had owned a Chippendale-style commode, and who would later write a biography about her.[5]\nIn her autobiographical books, Simmons said she was born intersex with ambiguous genitalia, as well as an internal uterus and ovaries, and was inappropriately assigned male at birth.[5] Simmons underwent sex reassignment surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1968, carried out by Dr. Milton Edgerton.[5] In Ball's Peninsula of Lies, he disputes Simmons claim that she was intersex, suggesting instead that Simmons had male genitalia and was unable to bear children.[5]\n\nMarriage[edit]\nSimmons legally changed her name to Dawn Pepita Langley Hall, and became engaged to John-Paul Simmons, then a young black motor mechanic with dreams of becoming a sculptor.[5] Their marriage on 21 January 1969 was the first legal interracial marriage in South Carolina,[1] and the ceremony was carried out in their drawing room reportedly after threats to bomb the church.[2] After a second ceremony in England, the crate containing their wedding gifts was firebombed in Charleston, and Simmons received a ticket the next day when the charred remains were obstructing a sidewalk.[7]\nOn 17 October 1971, her daughter, Natasha Margienell Manigault Paul Simmons, was born, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[5] Ball claims to have been told by John-Paul Simmons that Natasha was his child from another relationship, although \"Natasha fervently believed Dawn was her mother\".\nAfter an intruder raped Simmons and broke her arm, the family moved to Catskill, New York.[5]\n\nLater years and death[edit]\nIn 1982, she divorced John-Paul Simmons,[1] who had been abusive and suffered from schizophrenia.[5] After spending several years in Hudson, New York, she moved in with her daughter and three grandchildren, who had returned to Charleston.[2] In 1985, while back in Charleston, Simmons was featured as an extra in several scenes of ABC's miniseries North and South.[5]\nIn her final years, Simmons developed Parkinson's disease, and died at her daughter's home on 18 September 2000.[2]\n\nIn culture[edit]\nIn the 1987 film Withnail and I, set in 1969, the character Marwood reads a tabloid newspaper article about Gordon Langley Hall, entitled \"I Had to Become a Woman\".[8][9] Author Jack Hitt profiled Simmons in a 1996 episode of This American Life titled \"Dawn\".[10] Hitt, a native of Charleston, had grown up down the street from Simmons. From interviews, including with Simmons, Hitt assembled stories of her transsexuality, interracial marriages in the South, her rumoured voodoo powers, and rumoured hosting of a full-fledged debut for her chihuahua.[10] Hitt expanded the piece for publication in the October 1998 GQ.[10][11][12]\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\n\n\nSaraband for a saint: A modern morality play in two acts (1954)\nMe Papoose Sitter (1955)\nThe Gypsy Condesa (1958)\nPrincess Margaret (1958)\nGolden boats from Burma: The life of Ann Hasseltine Judson, the first American woman in Burma (1961)\nPeter Jumping Horse (1961)\nThe two lives of Baby Doe (1962)\nVinnie Ream: The story of the girl who sculptured Lincoln (1963)\nJacqueline Kennedy: A biography (1964)\nThe Sawdust Trail: The story of American evangelism (1964)\nDear Vagabonds: The story of Roy and Brownie Adams (1964)\n\n\nOsceola (1964)\nMr Jefferson's Ladies (1966)\nLady Bird and her daughters (1967)\nWilliam, Father of The Netherlands (1969)\nA rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A biography of Mary Todd Lincoln (1970)\nMan into woman: a transsexual autobiography (1971)\nAll for Love (1975)\nRosalynn Carter: Her Life Story (1979)\nMargaret Rutherford: A blithe spirit (1983)\nThe Two Worlds of Pearl S.

She is the 6th child[10] in a family of 13, born to a family of notable Hasidic leaders.[11] She has five elder sisters. Her father, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Stein, is the current Savraner Rebbe of Brooklyn. Her grandfather, Grand Rabbi Mordechai Stein,\u00a0is the current Faltishaner Rabbe, and is a descendant of Reb Mordechai Twersky (1770\u20131837). Her family is of Polish, Ukrainian / Romanian, Serbian, and Israeli descent, with modern Ukraine being the predominant origin.[12] She grew up speaking Yiddish and Hebrew, and was educated at a traditional all-boys Jewish Day School. The community in which she grew up was highly segregated by gender, which impacts almost all aspects of daily life.[13] She attended the Viznitz Yeshiva in Kiamesha Lake, Upstate New York,[14] for her high school education, also receiving ordination as a rabbi there in 2011.[15] In 2012, she left the Hasidic community (often referred to in Jewish communities as going \"off the derech\"), and in 2014, she started school at Columbia University's School of General Studies.\n\nComing out[edit]\n Abby Stein at University of California, Berkeley in April 2016\nIn November 2015, Stein made headlines when she came out on her blog as transgender,[16] and started physical transition. She was featured in some major media outlets, including The New York Times,[17] New York Post,[18] New York Magazine,[19] NBC,[20] Daily Dot,[21] and more. She also appeared on TV, on CNN,[22] Fox News,[23] HuffPost Live,[24] and Vice Canada.[25]\nShe also appeared on several international TV networks,[1] and in numerous international newspapers and magazines in over 20 different languages.[26][27][28]\n[29][30][31]\nWhen Stein left her community in 2012, and came out as an atheist, her parents said that, \"No matter what happens, no matter how you are, you are still my child.\" However, when she came out as trans, her father told her that, \"You should know that this means I might not be able to talk to you ever again.\"[32] Since then, her parents shunned her, and stopped talking with her altogether.[33] She has also received some hate from her former community,[34] though in an interview with Chasing News (a Fox News Short film company), she said that she got less hate than some people would have expected.[23]\nStein was featured in the 2016 Showtime Documentary series, Dark Net, in episode 8, \"Revolt\".[35]\n\nNaming Celebration / Bat Mitzvah[edit]\nOn June 4, 2016, Stein celebrated her transition and announced her name change to Abby Chava Stein at Romemu, a Jewish Renewal synagogue in the Upper West Side neighborhood of New York City.[36][37] In an interview with The Huffington Post, she said that even though she did not believe in God, she wanted to celebrate in a synagogue:\n\nI wanted to show that if you claim being trans is unacceptable in traditional Judaism, well, here is a community that is not just okay with accepting me as I am, but is celebrating with me, rejoicing with me. What I'm hoping is that by sharing my story, others in the same situation will realize that you can have your name changed in a synagogue. There are so many synagogues where you can't, but there are also those where you can \u2014 the Jewish Reform movement, the Conservative movement. Within Orthodoxy, there's still a long way to go. Every time something like this is done, it's one step closer to acceptance for everyone.[38]\nPublications[edit]\n Stein reads from her book, Becoming Eve, during a December 2019 talk at the California Institute of Integral Studies.\nStein's first book, \"Becoming Eve: My Journey from Ultra Orthodox Rabbi to Transgender Woman\", a memoir, was published by Seal Press (Hachette) on November 12, 2019.[39][40][41][42] ISBN\u00a09781580059169.\nStein was profiled in, and wrote the Foreword for, Peter Bussian's book of portraits, \"Trans New York: Photos and Stories of Transgender New Yorkers\". In the foreword, she described her love for New York City \u2013 both while in the Hasidic community, and now living as a Queer person in New York.[43] Published by Apollo Publishers, ISBN\u00a09781948062565.\n\nEssays[edit]\nHer writings have also been published in \"Queer Disbelief: Why LGBTQ Equality is an Atheist Issue\", written by Camille Beredjick,[44] edited by Hemant Mehta, and published by Friendly Atheist. Stein wrote an essay specifically for the book, titled, \"Trans Woman (and Former Hasidic Jew): Atheists Should Support the LGBTQ Movement\".[45] ISBN\u00a0978-0692989647.\nStein's essay about COVID-19 and it's impact on the LGBTQ community, titled, \"COVID has exploded Jewish LGBTQ acceptance online. There's no going back.\" (originally published on Forward.com,[46]) was included in \"When We Turned Within: Reflections on COVID-19\", an anthology of 165 essays edited by Sarah Tuttle-Singer and Menachem Creditor.[47] ISBN\u00a0979-8650180951.\nStein also contributed to Jewels of Elul: A Letter to Myself XII, a collection of essays published by singer / songwriter and music producer, Craig Taubman. Her essay, titled, \"Dayeinu\" (\"Enough\" in Hebrew), focused on the question of \"What If?\", and explored an answer to the question of \"What If you would have been\" born or raised in different circumstances.[48]\nStein also contributed an essay to Kaye Blegvad's \"The Pink Book: An Illustrated Celebration of the Color, from Bubblegum to Battleships\", discussing her relationship with the color pink, the Hasidic community and the color, and her feelings about stereotypical femininity.[49] ISBN\u00a0978-1452174815.\n\nActivism[edit]\nAfter coming out, Stein started an online support group to help trans people who come from Orthodox backgrounds. Stein also said that Facebook and online support communities have been her lifeline while leaving her community, which made her realize the positive power of online communities.[50]\nIn December 2015, Stein founded a support group for trans people from Orthodox backgrounds.[51] The group's first meeting had 12 people attending, most of them fellow Hasids struggling with their gender identity.[52] Stein's avid blogging also gained her a big following in the Jewish community, and she has become a role model for former ultra-Orthodox Jews \u2013 both LGBTQ and not.[53]\nSince coming out, Stein has also done several modeling projects depicting her life and transition, which have been published by numerous sites.[54] She told Refinery29 that \"I actually liked [shooting]. It did help me feel more comfortable\", and that she does these projects to encourage others on their journey.[55] In 2018, she also did several photo shoots and modeling projects with major fashion magazines such as Vogue[56] and InStyle.[57]\nIn addition to transgender activism, Stein has also been active in several projects to help those going Off the derech and leaving the ultra-Orthodox community. She has been working with Footsteps,[58] and its Canadian sister organization, Forward, for which she traveled to Montreal in 2016 to help jump-start.[59] In addition, she has also done some lay advocacy work with YAFFED, working towards a better education in the Hasidic schools, for which she has also engaged in political work.[60]\n\n Stein (holding a Shofar) and Her Girlfriend, at a Black Lives Matter Rally in Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn, July 2020\nIn 2018, Stein co-founded her own feminist/womanist multi-faith and inclusive celebration of women and non-binary people of all faith traditions, called Sacred Space, with former Mormon feminist and founder of Ordain Women, human rights lawyer Kate Kelly, and Yale Divinity School professor and Baptist preacher Eboni Marshall-Turman.[61]\nDuring the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Stein served as a national Surrogate for the Bernie Sanders campaign.[62]\n\nPublic speaking[edit]\nStein's first public appearance was in a promotional video for Footsteps 10th anniversary gala in 2013, where she was interviewed about her experience leaving the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.[63] Around the same time, she also did interviews with The Wall Street Journal[64] and Haaretz[65] about her experience leaving the community and fighting for custody. She also started giving public speeches on these topics.[66]\nIn addition to public speaking, she also teaches classes on Gender within Judaism, as well as bringing attention to trans people from Orthodox communities.[67] As of November 2016, she has had speeches at several universities. She has also done longer speaking tours to several communities in Montreal, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the New York metropolitan area.[68]\nStarting in 2016, Stein has also become a rising star in demand for speaking engagements and conferences, such as the Limmud franchise,[69] where, at the 2017 Limmud NY conference, she spoke more times than any other presenter.[70] At the same time, she has also spoken internationally at conferences such as the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee's annual Junction Conference in Berlin,[71] and the Miles Nadal JCC's Tikkun in Toronto.\nA big part of Stein's events have been with Hillel International affiliates all over the world. According to a 2017 report by Hillel, \"Stein has visited more than 100 campuses, sharing her story with thousands of students, in hopes of teaching them the importance of inclusivity, and that 'Judaism and queerness are not a contradiction'.\"[72] Her events drew hundreds of students, where she talks about her life, Transgender in Judaism, Intersectionality, policy, and politics, as it relates to the LGBTQ community, and consulting on how to be more inclusive.[73][74]\nStein is today a globally recognized author, activist, and speaker.[75] As of July 2020, she has given over 400 speeches at venues worldwide.[76]\n\nWomen's March leadership[edit]\n Stein on stage at the 2019 Women's March\nIn early 2019, Stein joined the Women's March leadership, as a member of the 2019 Steering Committee.[41] Despite some controversy surrounding the March and its leadership, Stein said that, \"I'm convinced that working with Women's March people, we can gain so much more by working together, even when there might be some parts we feel uncomfortable with\",[77] and \"expressed solidarity with other Jewish women who are supporting the march on grounds that it has emerged as an important and growing coalition of marginalized groups, including Jews, African Americans, Hispanics, and LGBT people\".[78]\nDuring the rally following the march, Stein also spoke on stage alongside Reverend Jacqui Lewis, senior minister of Middle Collegiate Church, and Muslim activist Remaz Abdelgader, leading the spiritual invocation opening the rally. During her speech, which she started with the traditional greeting of \"Shabbat Shalom\", she related the march to the Exodus, leading the audience in chants denouncing different forms of prejudice and oppression, with a chant of \"Let It Go!\".[79] She also called for unity, saying that, \"A lot of people out there, a lot of people in the media are trying to divide us. What brings us together is not the fact that we are all the same. What brings us together is our differences.\"[80]\nIn 2020, Stein was a featured speaker[81] at the Women's March NYC, in Foley Square.[82]\n\nHonors and awards[edit]\n Stein with teenage trans activist, Jazz Jennings at the 2016 Philadelphia Trans Health Conference.

She is Uruguay's first transgender university graduate, first trans lawyer, and first transgender person elected to office.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Selected works\n3 See also\n4 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nMichelle Su\u00e1rez B\u00e9rtora was born 21 February 1983[1] in Salinas, Canelones Department, Uruguay.[2] She transitioned at the age of 15 with the support of her mother. Studious, she followed her dream and became an attorney. Su\u00e1rez went to primary and secondary school in Salinas before entering university in 2004. After six years of study, and a legal transition to allow her to graduate with her proper gender, Su\u00e1rez earned her doctorate.[2] She was the first (and only) trans-woman to become a lawyer in Uruguay[1][3] graduating in 2010 from the University of the Republic as the first transgender person to complete university studies in the country.[4][5] In 2014, she also became the first transgender person elected to the Uruguayan legislature.[1][6]\nSu\u00e1rez is a member of, and the legal adviser to, the organization \"Ovejas Negras\" (Black Sheep), an LGBT rights organization. She joined in 2010, shortly after the death of her mother. Working was cathartic for dealing with her grief and she immediately[1] set out to draft the equal marriage proposal,[6] which was presented to Congress in 2011. The bill initially passed the Senate in 2012 and after review by the judicial committee received final approval in 2013.[7]\nSu\u00e1rez is also a body-image activist. Constantly asked about her obesity, she recognizes that women must follow a rigid aesthetic. She says it is sometimes even more of a struggle for transgender individuals, as multiple minorities. The stereotype of young, \"modelish,\" and eternally beautiful in Su\u00e1rez's view is absurd and oppressive for all women.[1][2]\nSuarez's belief is that prejudices must be addressed by legal standards which are substantive and accompanied by public debate.  She has written a book to address implementation of human rights for those who have difficulties because of their orientation or gender identity.[1]\nSuarez was sworn into the Uruguayan senate in October 2017, becoming the first transgender senator in the nation's history. In December 2017, Suarez resigned her seat in the senate after she was found guilty in a criminal investigation of forging legal documents while working as an attorney.\n\nSelected works[edit]\nHacia una Igualdad Sustantiva  Mujer y Salud en Uruguay (2012) (ISBN\u00a0978-9974-8303-1-8)[8]\nSee also[edit]\nList of transgender people\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f Formoso, Sof\u00eda (9 February 2015). \"Michelle Su\u00e1rez: La primera abogada trans de Uruguay\" (in Spanish).

Kalki holds two master's degrees: Masters in Journalism Mass Communication and Masters in International Relations. During her postgraduate studies, she started publishing a monthly magazine in Tamil for transgender women called Sahodari (which means sister). This is the first Tamil magazine published for transgender people in India.[2] Kalki also lived in Auroville for many years.\n\nActivism[edit]\nFrom 2005, Kalki has campaigned for transgender rights in India. She is known for her innovative activism using technology, art, films, and literature as tools to voice for transgender empowerment. She was one of India's well-known campaigners behind the Supreme Court of India's judgment legalizing transgender identity.[3] In 2009 when a popular matrimonial website rejected the matrimonial listing of a transgender woman, she took it as a challenge and launched India's first matrimonial website for transgender people.[4] The project was later closed due to lack of financial support. She has created more than 12 documentary films on LGBT rights and has also appeared in international documentary films.[5] In 2010, she trained many underprivileged transgender women in community journalism and encouraged them to make short documentary films telling their own stories.[6] When she lived in Auroville, she protested against encroachments of village lands by Auroville.[7] In October 2019, Kalki organised the first LGBTQI pride march in Coimbatore city of Tamil Nadu.\n\nEntrepreneurial ventures[edit]\nIn 2008, Kalki founded the Sahodari Foundation, an organization that advocates for transgender people in India.[8] In 2017, Subramaniam found the Transhearts art project, through which she has trained more than 200 transgender people in creating expressive artworks supporting their livelihood through workshops.[9]\n\nFilm career[edit]\nIn 2011, Kalki starred in a lead role in a Tamil film, Narthagi, which focused around the lives of transgender people. She made a special appearance in the 2018 film Sarkar in the song \"Oru Viral Puratchi\" which made her very popular.[10][11] She is the first transgender woman in India to do a lead role in a motion picture.[12] In 2019, Subramaniam acted in a lead role in a parallel Hindi feature film named Kalashnikov - The Lone Wolf which won the best film jury honours at the Dada Saheb Phalke Film Festival.[13]\n\nArt[edit]\nKalki's artworks are considered vibrant and colourful. She has been invited to USA, Canada, Netherlands, and Germany to speak on art and activism.[14]  In 2016, Subramaniam sold her paintings through a crowdfunding campaign and funded the education of underprivileged transgender women.[15] She uses art to find a voice without words, providing transgender victims of sexual and physical abuse a freedom to express their pain through art called the Red Wall Project, also known as the Shut Up! Show.[16] Hundreds of transgender people have participated in the project across the different States of India and wrote their testimonials on a white paper with a red palm impression to show protest against sexual exploitation.[17]In November 2019, Kalki paid a tribute art show to the late Bollywood actress Sridevi by exhibiting digital portraits of Sridevi. She mentioned that Sridevi has been her inspiration since childhood.[18]\n\nThe Redwall project[edit]\nThe Redwall is a project that was found in 2018 by Kalki to make the voices of the transgender and gender-diverse people of India powerful. Kalki and the team of Sahodari Foundation have been interviewing more than 500 transgender and gender-diverse survivors of sexual abuse and assault from various states of India including People living with HIV (PLHIV), documenting their experiences as first-person accounts lives in depth. The stories transgender people painful experiences of bullying, rape and assault are documented by the team. This is a community art project where the participant writes the experience on a handmade paper and imprints their red palm on it. These testimonials are exhibited in academic institutions and galleries for public viewing and to show resistance against abuse.[19]\n\nPublications[edit]\nIn 2015, Kalki's collection of Tamil poems on transgender lives titled Kuri Aruthean (\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bbf \u0b85\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0ba9\u0bcd) was published by Vikatan Publications. The collection consisted of 25 poems with line-drawings by Kalki.[20] She has also written number of articles and essays in online and print publications. In 2018, three of her poems from the poetry collection Kuri Aruthean were translated in German language and published in an art journal. Six of her poems from the book were adopted into poetic short films titled Vadu (The Scar) directed by herself.[21] She has also written many articles in Indian print and online publications on LGBT rights in India.\n\nRecognition[edit]\nIn 2010, Kalki received international recognition when she was the official guest of the United States of America as a Human Rights Activist through IVLP and was honoured in the United Nations Office in New York City for her social work.[22] She is also a recipient of achievers award from Coimbatore Lawyers Association.[23]\nIn 2014, she was chosen by Facebook as one of the 12 inspiring women of the world who used Facebook for community development.[24] In 2016, she was nominated by NDTV for its Woman of Worth Award under the arts category.[25]\nIn February 2017, she was invited by Harvard Business School, Harvard University to speak on behalf of the sexual minorities, and represent the Indian transgender community. She received a standing ovation for her speech. She shared the chair with Telugu actor and Politician Pawan Kalyan, Manish Malhotra, R Madhavan and Meagan Fallone.[26] Inspired by Kalki's speech Pawan Kalyan later in his interview to the media said, he has plans to start a separate wing for the transgender people in his political party Jana sena of Andhra Pradesh.[27]\nIn 2018, Subramaniam was invited by Schwules Museum, Germany to present her artworks, poetry films and activism in an Artist Talk with Professor Claudia Reiche.[28] In June 2019, Kalki was invited by TransAmsterdam, a transgender art and culture organisation in Netherlands and was conferred the International Ambassador for Life title by the organisation.[29]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ [1] My Story, by Kalki\n\n^ [2] Kalki Subramaniam| About\n\n^ \"Cutting Phallus, destroying binaries - TheNewsminute.com\".\n\n^ \"India's first transsexual matrimony site launched - News18.com\".\n\n^ Parthasarathy, Sindhuja (28 February 2015). \"Breaking Free - The Hindu\".

They made their directing debut in 1996 with Bound, and achieved fame with their second film The Matrix (1999), a major box office success for which they won the Saturn Award for Best Director. They wrote and directed its two sequels: The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (both in 2003), and were involved in the writing and production of other works in that franchise.\nFollowing the commercial success of The Matrix series, they wrote and produced the 2005 film V for Vendetta (an adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore & David Lloyd), and in 2008 released the film Speed Racer, a live-action adaptation of the Japanese anime series. Their next film, Cloud Atlas, based on the novel by David Mitchell and co-written and co-directed by Tom Tykwer, was released in 2012. Their film Jupiter Ascending and the Netflix series Sense8, which they co-created with J. Michael Straczynski, both debuted in 2015; the second season of Sense8 ended the series in 2018 and was Lana's first major creative undertaking without Lilly.[8][9]\nSince the series finale of Sense8, the Wachowskis have been working separately on different projects: Lilly is writing and executive-producing Showtime's Work in Progress (2019) with creators Abby McEnany and Tim Mason, while Lana is filming a fourth Matrix film planned for 2021, which she wrote with David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and careers\n2 Film and television careers\n\n2.1 Early film projects\n2.2 The Matrix franchise\n2.3 Later collaborations\n2.4 Solo projects\n\n\n3 Style and influences\n4 Frequent collaborators\n5 Film production and comic book publishing\n6 Unrealized projects\n7 Personal lives\n\n7.1 Lana's gender transition\n7.2 Lilly's gender transition\n\n\n8 Gaming\n9 Works\n\n9.1 Films\n9.2 Television\n9.3 Video games\n9.4 Comic books\n9.5 Music videos\n\n\n10 Box-office\n11 Awards and nominations\n12 Notes\n13 References\n14 External links\n\n\nEarly life and careers[edit]\nLana was born Laurence Wachowski in Chicago in 1965; Lilly was born Andrew Paul Wachowski two and a half years later, in 1967. Their mother, Lynne (n\u00e9e Luckinbill), was a nurse and painter. Their father, Ron Wachowski, was a businessman of Polish descent. Their uncle is the actor and Primetime Emmy Award-winning producer Laurence Luckinbill.[2][10] They have two other sisters: Julie and Laura.[11][12] Julie was credited as assistant coordinator in the film Bound;[13] she is a novelist and screenwriter.[14]\nThe Wachowskis attended the Kellogg Elementary School in Chicago's Beverly area, and graduated from Whitney Young High School, known for its performing arts and science curriculum, in 1983 and 1985, respectively.[15] Former classmates recall them playing Dungeons & Dragons and working in the school's theater and TV program.[15]\nLana went to Bard College in New York and Lilly attended Emerson College in Boston. Each dropped out before graduating, and they ran a house painting and construction business in Chicago.\nBeginning in 1993 they wrote several issues of Ectokid for Marvel Comics' Razorline imprint (created by horror novelist Clive Barker), which were credited to Lana.[16][15] They also wrote for the series Clive Barker's Hellraiser and Clive Barker's Nightbreed for Marvel's Epic Comics imprint.\n\nFilm and television careers[edit]\nEarly film projects[edit]\nIn the mid-1990s they went into film writing, including the script for Assassins in 1994, which was directed by Richard Donner and released in 1995. Warner Bros. bought the script and included two more pictures in the contract.[17] Donner had their script \"totally rewritten\" by Brian Helgeland[18] and the Wachowskis tried unsuccessfully to remove their names from the film.[11] They say the experience gave them the perspective that they should become directors or \"[they will] never survive as writers in this town\".[19]\nTheir next project was the 1996 neo-noir thriller Bound, for which they wrote the script and made their debut as directors. The film was well received for its style and craft,[20] and was noted as one of the first mainstream films to feature a same-sex relationship without it being central to the plot.[21] Taking advantage of the positive buzz, the Wachowskis asked to direct their next picture, The Matrix.[17]\n\nThe Matrix franchise[edit]\nMain article: The Matrix franchise\nThey completed The Matrix, a science fiction action film, in 1999. The movie stars Keanu Reeves as Neo, a hacker recruited by a rebellion to aid them in the fight against machines who have taken over the world and placed humanity inside a simulated reality called \"the Matrix\". Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano also star. The movie was a critical and commercial hit for Warner Bros. It won four Academy Awards, including for \"Best Visual Effects\" for popularizing the bullet time visual effect. The Matrix came to be a major influence for action movies and has appeared in several \"greatest science fiction films\" lists.[22][23][24] In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"[25]\nAfter its success, the Wachowskis directed two sequels back-to-back, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, both released in 2003. The Matrix Reloaded received positive critical reception, although not on the level of the original.[26] It became a major box office hit, retaining the spot of the highest-grossing R-rated film for over a decade (until 2016's Deadpool).[27] The Matrix Revolutions received a mixed critical reception and performed only moderately in the box office. Although profitable, it was slightly less so compared to the original film.[28][29]\nDuring production of the first film, the Wachowskis and Spencer Lamm, who ran the film's official website, developed comics based on the setting of the film, which were published free of charge on the website. These and a few short stories were released in three series from 1999 to 2003, with several of them (along with new material) collected in two print volumes in 2003 and 2004. The Wachowskis themselves contributed \"Bits and Pieces\", a prequel to the movie that explains the origins of the Matrix, featuring illustrations by Geof Darrow, the movie's conceptual designer. Other writers and artists that contributed to the series include Neil Gaiman, Dave Gibbons, Paul Chadwick, Ted McKeever, Poppy Z. Brite, and Steve Skroce.\nAfter Lilly Wachowski came out as transgender, she encouraged looking back on her and Lana's works \"through the lens of our transness\", saying that the themes of identity, self-image and transformation are apparent in The Matrix, which is \"about one person's struggle with and eventual acceptance of an identity that exists beyond the borders of a rigidly defined system\".[30]\n\nLater collaborations[edit]\nThe Wachowskis' next feature film was V for Vendetta, an adaptation of Alan Moore & David Lloyd's graphic novel of the same name, starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. They wrote and produced the film with Matrix producer Joel Silver, who had previously purchased the film rights to the graphic novel. The Wachowskis offered the film to James McTeigue, the first assistant director of The Matrix trilogy, as his directorial debut. Moore did not participate in the production, as he was disappointed by previous Hollywood adaptations of his work, and disagreed with differences between his graphic novel and the screenplay. Following a statement to the press by Silver that Moore was supposedly excited to learn more about the movie, Moore demanded that Silver retract it, and had his own name removed from the credits when he didn't.[31] The film's controversial storyline and themes have been both criticized and praised by sociopolitical groups. It was released in 2005 and was well received critically; it was a box office success but did not rank on the scale of The Matrix films.[32] The film popularized the image of the Guy Fawkes mask, as the version designed by David Lloyd for the graphic novel and used in the movie was adopted as a symbol by the online hacktivist group Anonymous two years later.[33]\nIn 2006, Silver had the Wachowskis and McTeigue hired to revamp The Invasion for Warner Bros. The studio was disappointed in the film as produced by director Oliver Hirschbiegel and hired the Wachowskis to rewrite a portion of the script and add new action scenes, which McTeigue directed. The film, the fourth adaptation of the novel The Body Snatchers, was released in 2007 and was not a critical or box office success. The Wachowskis and McTeigue are not credited on the film.[34]\nThe Wachowskis returned to directing with Speed Racer (2008) which starred Emile Hirsch. The film, which was again produced by Silver, was an adaptation of a 1960s Japanese manga series originally called Mach GoGoGo, which had previously been adapted as an anime television series in 1967. The Wachowskis were attracted to the project because the series was the first anime they had watched and they wanted to make a family-friendly film for their nieces and nephews to enjoy.[35][36] In an effort to simulate the look of anime in live action the Wachowskis had cinematographer David Tattersall shoot the movie digitally on a digital backlot with the intention of adding extensive visual effects in post-production. The movie was considered a critical and commercial disappointment.[37] While its special effects were noted as outstanding, the storyline is considered lacking.[38] It was nominated in the category of \"Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel\" for the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards. Its box office gross was $93\u00a0million compared to a production budget of $120\u00a0million. Since then, critics periodically have put the film on lists of underrated or cult films.[39][40][41][42][43]\nThe Wachowskis' next film project was Ninja Assassin, a martial arts film starring Rain that was released in 2009. It was inspired by Rain's fighting scene in Speed Racer.[44] It was produced by the Wachowskis in their last involvement with Silver, and directed by McTeigue. The screenplay was written by Matthew Sand and J. Michael Straczynski, whom the Wachowskis called six weeks before filming to ask him for a total rewrite completed within a week, because they were dissatisfied with the earlier drafts and were running out of time.[45] Ninja Assassin received negative reviews and performed lukewarmly in the theaters but respectably on home video.[46][47][48][49]\n\n Lilly (left) and Lana Wachowski at Fantastic Fest in 2012\nTheir next directorial outing was Cloud Atlas, which was adapted from David Mitchell's 2004 novel of the same name and starred an ensemble cast which included Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. Cloud Atlas was written and directed in collaboration with German filmmaker Tom Tykwer, to whom the Wachowskis had introduced the novel several years earlier. The filmmakers failed to secure funding from a studio (save for $20\u00a0million by Warner Bros.) and the film was produced independently after much trouble.[50][51] With a budget of over $100\u00a0million it was noted as the most expensive independent movie to that date and the first attempt at a German blockbuster.[52] The movie opened at the 37th annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2012 to acclaim and received a loud and lengthy standing ovation.[53][54][55] In its general release a month later, it received polarizing reviews and eventually appeared in both \"Best Film\" and \"Worst Film\" lists. Overall reviews were mixed to positive.[56] The film received many nominations and awards, particularly for its technical aspects, including 10 nominations in the German Film Awards, out of which it won five, and five Saturn Award nominations, out of which it won two. David Mitchell liked the script of Cloud Atlas, spent some time on the set (including filming a cameo), and had a positive impression about the end result.[57][58] According to the Wachowskis the movie was the hardest of their films to make, the one they are the most proud of, and the one they have been told has touched people's lives the most. They believe Cloud Atlas will be the film for which they will be remembered.[19][59][60]\nThe Wachowskis subsequently produced and directed Jupiter Ascending, an original space opera screenplay they wrote. The film was released in 2015.[61] It stars Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis, and features the Wachowskis' regular collaborators John Gaeta on visual effects and Kym Barrett on costumes. According to Deadline, the financial and critical failure of Jupiter Ascending caused their business relationship with Warner Bros, that began with The Matrix franchise, to be terminated.[62]\nTheir next project was the Netflix science fiction drama series Sense8, created and written with J. Michael Straczynski. Sense8 features an international ensemble cast and was shot in multiple cities around the world. The Wachowskis directed most of the episodes of the first season, with the rest being handled by McTeigue, Tykwer, and their go-to visual effects supervisor on their movies, Dan Glass, in his directorial debut.[63] The first season premiered in 2015 to generally positive reviews, particularly for the scale of the production and the presentation of diverse and LGBT characters and themes, winning the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Drama Series.[64][65] It also received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music.[66] After the first season, Lilly took a break from it, for what turned out to be the remainder of the series. A Christmas special was released December 23, 2016 with the remainder of the show's second season released in May 2017.[67] Subsequently, the third season was cancelled, and Sense8 concluded with a two-hour finale which aired in June 2018.\nIn June 2016, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences invited the Wachowskis to join its ranks.[68]\n\nSolo projects[edit]\nIn May 2019, it was reported that Lilly would co-write, and co-showrun the eight-episode first season of a drama comedy series called Work in Progress, created by Abby McEnany and Tim Mason for Showtime.[69] The series premiered in December 2019.[70] In January 2020, the series was renewed for a 10-episode second season, with which Lilly will continue to be involved.[71]\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Lana would be returning to write, direct and produce the fourth installment of the Matrix series, with Reeves and Moss also reprising their roles; it will mark the first film made by only one of the Wachowskis. Instead, Lana wrote the script with David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon.[72] The film is expected to be released in May 2021.[73]\n\nStyle and influences[edit]\nJ. Michael Straczynski, who has worked with the Wachowskis on Ninja Assassin and Sense8, has said that the sisters told him they were reading his column on scriptwriting for the Writer's Digest magazine, for inspiration and pointers.[74] Straczynski contributed to the magazine from 1981 to 1991.[75]\nIn 1998, in the context of explaining how they got their start in filmmaking, the Wachowskis mentioned Roger Corman's book, How I Made A Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime, and indicated, with laughter, that they liked his movies, and began by wanting to \"make a low-budget horror movie.\"[76] In the same interview, they expressed being flattered, after their first film, by comparisons to the Coen brothers, who had \"made five, maybe six great movies\u2026\" at that time.[76]\nSpeaking to Bernard Weintraub of The New York Times in April 1999, the Wachowskis mention explicitly preparing for their first Matrix production by studying the works of John Woo \"and other Hong Kong filmmakers\", as well as reading and rereading Homer's Odyssey, and studying the works of John Huston, Stanley Kubrick, Fritz Lang, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, and Billy Wilder.[77]\nMark Miller, writing in Wired in 2003, also listed Homer, Hermann Hesse, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and philosopher Cornel West.[15] In an interview with Gadfly in 1998 (after their first movie), the Wachowskis reiterated their influence by or enjoyment of Huston (e.g. Treasure of the Sierra Madre) and Wilder (e.g., Sunset Boulevard and Lost Weekend), and added to these the impacts of Alfred Hitchcock (e.g. Strangers on a Train and Psycho), Roman Polanski (e.g. Repulsion), and Francis Ford Coppola (the Godfather movies, and The Conversation).[76]\nKen Wilber has been cited as an influence.[78]\nThe Wachowskis admit to a love for telling multi-part stories. \"Because we grew up on comic books and the Tolkien trilogy, one of the things we're interested in is bringing serial fiction to cinema,\" Lana has said. Lilly says: \"We think movies are fairly boring and predictable. We want to screw with audiences' expectations.\"[79] In terms of themes expressed in their body of work, Lana has cited \"the inexplicable nature of the universe [being] in constant dialogue with our own consciousness and our consciousness actually affect[ing] the inexplicable nature of the universe\",[80] \"interconnectivity and about truth beneath the surface\",[81] \"the paradox of choice and choicelessness\",[82] \"transcendence ... transcending archetypal boxes, stereotypes\", \"race ... an important component\" and \"gender ... it's one of our most significant cultural subjects\".[83]\nThe Wachowskis cited the art of comic book artist Geof Darrow as an influence on the look of The Matrix. Also, they said that Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, and Akira were anime that inspired them, saying \"in anime, one thing that they do that we tried to bring to our film was a juxtaposition of time and space in action beats\".\nThe Wachowskis cited Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as a major influence for Cloud Atlas.[84] They first saw the film when they were ten and seven, respectively.[11]\nLana has most been influenced by 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, Ma vie en rose, and My Neighbor Totoro.[85] Both Wachowskis are fans of the Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Wicked City, Ninja Scroll and Fist of the North Star anime films.[86]\nNone of the home video releases of their films feature any deleted scenes. Lana says that despite often having to cut scenes from their movies, they do not want to include deleted scenes in such releases, as this would suggest that their films suffer from incompleteness. They love their finished products and believe them complete.[87][88] For the same reason, they have not released their films for home video with director's or extended cuts. They also avoid recording audio commentary tracks, having participated only on the track recorded for the LaserDisc of Bound. The sisters say they learned that offering an interpretation of their films means that viewers will be less likely to express their own interpretation.[89][90]\n\nFrequent collaborators[edit]\nThis section has multiple issues.

In the Sense8 series finale, the real book Venus Castina: Famous Female Impersonators Celestial and Human makes an appearance as the unlikely object that brought a lesbian couple together;[146] according to Lana and the actresses that portray the couple, the duo have been based on Lana and Karin.[147][148][149]\nKinowerks is their pre- and post-production and effects studio, based in the Ravenswood neighbourhood of Chicago.[150] It has been acclaimed for its green-friendly design, including solar panels, a planted roof, countertops and floors made of recycled materials, plug-in car stations, a water reuse and filtration system, skylights, and a pneumatic elevator.[151][152] Roger Ebert was invited to watch a restored print of The Godfather in the Kinowerks facilities and met the Wachowskis,[153] but he was oblivious to the fact the studio belonged to them. According to the Chicago Tribune's Christopher Pirelli, the facility is very low-key: \"an industrial building that appears neither old nor especially new\" and \"It could be an upscale dentist's office\" while the \"inside is rather unexpected\" and has numerous mementos of past film projects.[154] On October 22, 2018, the Wachowskis announced their plans to close and list Kinowerks for $5\u00a0million.[152]\nIn 2003, they created Burlyman Entertainment and released comic books based on The Matrix[155][156] as well as two original bi-monthly series:\n\nShaolin Cowboy\u00a0\u2013 created, written, and drawn by Geof Darrow (the Wachowskis contributed the opening dialogue to each issue)[157]\nDoc Frankenstein\u00a0\u2013 created by Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce, written by the Wachowskis, with art by Skroce.[158]\nUnrealized projects[edit]\nMain article: The Wachowskis' unrealized projects\nThe Wachowskis' first script was a thriller called Carnivore.[19] It has been described as \"a Corman-style, low-budget horror movie that dealt with cannibalism or, more specifically, rich people being eaten by cannibals\".[77] The writing was well received and the script made the duo noticed,[11][77] although interest in making the movie was low as executives told them \"This is a bad idea. I can't make this. I'm rich.\"[77] Years later, on April 6, 1999, a week after The Matrix opened in American theaters, Variety reported Trimark was looking to buy the script and were in talks with George Romero to direct it with production scheduled to begin in August.[159] In April 2001, news of the Wachowskis producing it for Lionsgate and looking for a director surfaced again,[160] and in August 2003 a second time, with their go-to cinematographer Bill Pope rumored to be making his directorial debut with it.[161] The film ultimately went unproduced.[11]\nAnother two of their earliest scripts which were never produced were Plastic Man, based on the DC Comics superhero of the same name and Vertical Run based on the book of the same name by Joseph R. Garber.[15][162][163]\nAfter completing The Matrix, the Wachowskis were looking to make an animated adaptation of Frank Miller's Hard Boiled graphic novel.[164] The comic was drawn by Geof Darrow, the conceptional designer of The Matrix and later its sequels. The project didn't move forward because Miller didn't want it to be an animated film.[165]\nIn November 2000, Variety reported the Wachowskis would produce, co-create and direct second unit on a new Conan the Barbarian movie for Warner Bros. which was to be written and directed by John Milius and which could see Arnold Schwarzenegger make an appearance. The Wachowskis were planning to juggle their pre-production involvement on the movie and work on The Matrix sequels at the same time.[166] In January 2004 it was reported that development on King Conan: Crown of Iron had stalled for years because of the Wachowskis' involvement in The Matrix sequels and now that the movies were complete they decided to abandon the project of their own volition because of the frequent clashes they had experienced with Milius concerning the tone and direction of the movie.[167] Lana once suggested Conan the Barbarian as her favorite movie based on comics to which Lilly also responded enthusiastically.[164]\nIn 2008,[168] the Wachowskis were producing for Madhouse an animated film based on their comic book company's Shaolin Cowboy,[169][170] titled Shaolin Cowboy in The Tomb of Doom.[165] The feature is co-directed by the comic book's creator Geof Darrow and Seiji Mizushima, a Japanese director.[168] When the American financiers backed out, the film was left half-finished and in need of $3\u00a0million. Darrow does not believe that the required amount of money to finish it will be found.[171]\nIn December 2009, Arianna Huffington tweeted pictures of herself on the set of \"a Wachowskis movie on Iraq from the perspective of the future\".[172] CHUD.com reported what the Wachowskis were doing was camera tests and shooting of test footage on the Red digital camera for a future movie, but not shooting the movie itself.[173] In March 2010, Jesse Ventura said he had also shot for the project right before Huffington. Both of them were dressed as people from roughly 100 years in the future and they were asked to improvise without a script about the Iraq War.[174] In May 2010, Deadline reported the movie was going to be a hard-R story that would begin in the future but move back to the then-current war in Iraq and center on the homosexual relationship between an American soldier and an Iraqi. The Wachowskis completed the script and were searching for funding to direct it.[175] In July 2010, the movie was reported to have begun casting under the codename CN9 (or CN-9),[176] and in August 2010 the full name was revealed as Cobalt Neural 9.[177] In September 2010, Vulture posted additional details about the script and revealed the movie would be told in found footage-style from the perspective of digital archaeologists from the future. An estimated $20\u00a0million budget was reported although they were told a studio would \"never, ever\" finance it but perhaps the Wachowskis could do it themselves.[178] In December 2010, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Salman Rushdie and Cornel West had also shot talking head sequences along with the previously reported involvement of Huffington and Ventura but the Wachowskis were looking into other movies because of troubles financing it.[179] In September 2012, Aleksandar Hemon wrote about the making of Cloud Atlas and recalled he too was one of the people the Wachowskis had invited to interview in December 2009, to help inspire the script of Cobalt Neural 9.[11] The last update on the film was in October 2012, when the Wachowskis were asked about it and they responded they were still keen to make it, because they had invested both financially ($5\u00a0million) and emotionally into it, even if that ends up being in a different form than film.[180]\nIn December 2010, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the Wachowskis were planning to direct for Warner Bros. a script of theirs called Hood, which was a modern adaptation of the Robin Hood legend. The Wachowskis were said to be reaching out to actors, including Will Smith.[179]\n\nPersonal lives[edit]\nLilly married Alisa Blasingame in 1991.[181] In 2016 Lilly mentioned having a boyfriend.[182] In 2019, she said Mickey Ray Mahoney has now become her partner and has moved in with her.[183][184] Mahoney is an adjunct professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and a trans man.[182]\nLana married Thea Bloom in 1993; they divorced in 2002. Lana subsequently began dating Karin Winslow; they married in 2009.[11][185] Winslow is a board member of the Chicago House and Social Service Agency.[186][187]\nRaised by a \"hardcore atheist\" father and an \"ex-Catholic turned Shamanist\" mother,[80] the duo once described their religious beliefs as non-denominational.[87] Lana is a vegetarian.[188] During the Democratic Party presidential primaries of 2016, The Advocate posted a video message of Lana talking about why she would be supporting Bernie Sanders.[189]\n\nLana's gender transition[edit]\nRumors that Lana Wachowski was transitioning spread in the early 2000s, though neither sibling spoke directly on the subject at the time.[190] In 2003, Gothamist reported the possible transition.[191] In a 2007 interview, Joel Silver, the producer of numerous Wachowski films, said that the rumors concerning the transition were \"all untrue\", saying that \"they just don't do interviews, so people make things up.\" Crew members working on Speed Racer said similar things.[192]\nLana completed her transition after Speed Racer's release in 2008,[193] and by at least December 2010, trade magazines and newspapers referred to her as \"Lana Wachowski\",[179][194] and to the duo as \"Andy and Lana Wachowski.\"[195] On some documents her name is shown as Laurenca Wachowski.[15][190][196] In July 2012, Lana made her first public appearance after transitioning, in a video discussing the creative process behind Cloud Atlas.[197] Lana is the first major Hollywood director to come out as transgender.[4]\nIn a September 2012 interview with Aleksandar Hemon of The New Yorker, Lana described an incident in third grade at Catholic School when she was hesitant to join the boys' line and unconsciously accepted herself as belonging to the girls'.[198]\nIn October 2012, Lana Wachowski received the Human Rights Campaign's Visibility Award.[199] In her acceptance speech, she revealed that once during her youth, she had considered suicide because of her feelings of confusion about her gender identity. Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the reclusive sisters. Lana said that, although she and Lilly had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the previous decade, it was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends. Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.\n\nExplaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said, \nThere are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others. If I can be that person for someone else, then the sacrifice of my private civic life may have value.[200]\nIn February 2014, Lana received the Freedom Award from Equality Illinois at their annual gala in Chicago.[201][202][203]\n\nLilly's gender transition[edit]\nIn March 2016, Lilly Wachowski also came out as a transgender woman, issuing a statement to the Windy City Times after a visit from a reporter from the Daily Mail newspaper, who had attempted to get an interview with her about it.[5][6][204][205][206] In that article, she said, \"I am one of the lucky ones. Having the support of my family and the means to afford doctors and therapists has given me the chance to actually survive this process. Transgender people without support, means and privilege do not have this luxury. And many do not survive.\"[207]\nHer first public appearance following transition was a few weeks later, at the 27th GLAAD Media Awards, where she accepted an award for her Netflix series Sense8 for Outstanding Drama Series.[208] She said, \"I didn't feel obligated to be here, but I wanted to do something. And it's serendipitous that the awards were a couple of weeks later and our show was up for an award.\"[209]\n\nGaming[edit]\nLana and Lilly are self-proclaimed gamers. As teens they spent their weekends in the attic playing Dungeons & Dragons.[11] They liken the process of their playing parties to their process of filmmaking. Along with some of their friends, they wrote a 350-page role-playing game of their own called High Adventure.\nOn the video game front, they had been exchanging letters with Hideo Kojima and met him during a Famitsu interview in late 1999.[210] Metal Gear Solid was the first video game they played after finishing work on The Matrix. Candidates for an adaptation of the first Matrix movie to video game form included Kojima, Bungie and Shiny Entertainment, whose Messiah PC game impressed them.[211][212] Shiny's David Perry, who ultimately had his company develop and collaborate with them on the Enter the Matrix and The Matrix: Path of Neo video games, was impressed with their familiarity with the medium; this proved helpful during development.[213] The Wachowskis owned both a PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game console and played several games such as Splinter Cell and Halo 2.[214] They reportedly destroyed their Xbox during a Halo deathmatch.[211] Actor Collin Chou recounts an instance of visiting their office and finding them playing video games on the floor.[215] Lilly is a fan of the Death Jr. PlayStation Portable game.[216]\nAsked about their feelings about turning the tightly controlled Matrix saga to the unpredictable form of an MMORPG with The Matrix Online, the duo appeared enthusiastic about the nature and possibilities of video games:\n\nThe \"vagaries of an MMO where unpredictable player behavior is the rule,\" is the reason for doing it. Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.\nGaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.\n\nYet the fact that The Matrix films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [Mortal Kombat], is fantastically exciting.\u2014\u2009The Wachowskis[217]\n\nWorks[edit]\nFilms[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nFunctioned as\n\nNotes\n\n\nDirectors\n\nWriters\n\nProducers\n\n\n1995\n\nAssassins\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n[18][11][76]\n\n\n1996\n\nBound\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nExecutive\n\n\n\n\n1999\n\nThe Matrix\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nExecutive\n\n\n\n\n2001\n\nThe Matrix Revisited\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nExecutive\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2003\n\nThe Animatrix\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nDirect-to-videoWrote: \"Final Flight of the Osiris\"Story by: \"The Second Renaissance Part I & II\" and \"Kid's Story\"\n\n\nThe Matrix Reloaded\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nExecutive\n\n\n\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nExecutive\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\nV for Vendetta\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nSecond unit directors (uncredited)[11][218][219][220][221][222]\n\n\n2007\n\nThe Invasion\n\nNo\n\nUncredited\n\nNo\n\nRewrites[34][223]\n\n\n2008\n\nSpeed Racer\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\nNinja Assassin\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\nCloud Atlas\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nCo-directed with Tom Tykwer\n\n\n2014\n\nGoogle Me Love\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nExecutive\n\nShort film[224]\n\n\n2015\n\nJupiter Ascending\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\nThe Matrix 4\n\nLana only\n\nLana only\n\nLana only\n\n\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nFunctioned as\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCreators\n\nShowrunners\n\nWriters\n\nDirectors\n\n\n2015\u20132018\n\nSense8\n\nYes\n\nSeason 1: The WachowskisSeason 2: Lana only\n\nSeason 1: The WachowskisSeason 2: Lana only\n\nSeason 1: The WachowskisSeason 2: Lana only\n\nCo-created with J.

She ran as a Justice Democrat in the Arizona's 8th congressional district special election primary following the resignation of Trent Franks in 2018.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Candidacy in Arizona's 8th U.S. congressional district special election primary\n3 Bernie Sanders 2020 Presidential Campaign\n4 Political views\n\n4.1 Healthcare\n4.2 Environment\n4.3 Minimum wage\n4.4 Campaign finance reform\n4.5 Automatic voter registration\n\n\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBorn in Mesa, Arizona in the 1980s, Brianna grew up in poverty, \"moving from house to house because the family kept being evicted.\" \u00a0Following the divorces of her grandmother, aunt, and mother, her family moved to Tennessee, then Montana and Washington state. After her mother remarried, Brianna moved out and became involved in documenting street races, at one point also convincing a Spokane-area racetrack to provide a safe track for teens to race cars in.[3]\nWhile in Spokane, she met her now ex-wife and raised a daughter together when Westbrook was 19 years old, working in construction to support the new family. At 22, she returned to Arizona and worked in car sales, becoming a sales manager at Arrowhead Honda in Peoria, Arizona, northwest of Phoenix.[4] While working at Arrowhead Honda, Westbrook began her transition, documenting it through YouTube, where her now-deleted channel once had several thousand subscribers.[3] Shortly after coming out as transgender, she also became an activist, advocating for LGBT and disability protections and protesting the passing of AZ SB 1432 in the state legislature.[5]\n\nCandidacy in Arizona's 8th U.S. congressional district special election primary[edit]\nWestbrook began her foray into electoral politics in response to the rise of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, announcing she would run against Republican incumbent Trent Franks in the US congressional midterm election in 2018, before learning of his resignation.[3][6] The news of Frank's resignation following his sexual harassment scandal led to a rise in media attention of the subsequent special election, which gave Westbrook, running to become what would be the first transgender representative of in the US Congress, support from national figures such as Rosie O'Donnell, Chelsea Manning[5] and Cameron Russell.[7]\nAlthough Franks's seat had been historically ignored by Democratic contenders,[3] Westbrook was joined in the Democratic primary election by physician Hiral Tipirneni. Public high school teacher Gene Scharer, who ran against Franks in 2012,[8] had intended to join Westbrook and Tipirneni in the primary, but fell hundreds of signatures short and did not qualify to run. The signatures for both Scharer and Westbrook's campaigns were challenged in court by a supporter of Tipirneni's campaign, but only Scharer was disqualified as Westbrook exceeded the number of valid signatures needed to qualify.[9]\nWestbrook's campaign collected endorsements from Our Revolution,[10] Run With Pride,[11] Justice Democrats[12] and the Phoenix chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America by unanimous vote.[13] When she received a candidate endorsement application from the National Rifle Association (NRA), she responded by recording herself tearing the form in half.[14] Westbrook was not endorsed by the NRA.\nThe February 27, 2018, special election primary ended with Tipirneni taking 60.2% of the Democratic vote and Westbrook taking 39.7%.[15] After losing the primary, Westbrook actively supported her former competitor's run for the special election as she began a campaign for the Arizona Senate's 22nd district, sharing a mutual agreement with Tipirneni to support one another's campaigns.[16] Tipirneni ultimately lost the special election to Republican Debbie Lesko by 4.8 percentage points.[15] Westbrook's candidacy in the Arizona Senate\u2019s 22nd district election primary for the state legislature was contested and won by radio announcer Wendy Garcia, who subsequently lost to Republican David Livingston in the general election by 26.6 percentage points.[15]\n\nBernie Sanders 2020 Presidential Campaign[edit]\nWestbrook endorsed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders's 2020 campaign for\u00a0President of the United States of America and is a national surrogate for the Bernie Sanders for President 2020 campaign.[17][18][19] March 7, 2020, the Bernie Sanders for President 2020 campaign announced Arizona State Senator Martin Quezada and Arizona House Representative Richard Andrade; co-founder and lead organizer for Arizona Educators United Rebecca Garelli; Phoenix Councilman Carlos Garcia; East Valley NAACP President Roy Tatem; former state Rep. Wenona Benally; Tucson City Council Member Lane Santa Cruz and LGBTQ+ Rights activist Brianna Westbrook Arizona state co-chairs the 2020 campaign.[20]\n\nPolitical views[edit]\nWestbrook is a Justice Democrat, and advocates for a number of key positions of its platform, including debt-free college and \"Medicare For All\".[21]\n\nHealthcare[edit]\nWestbrook is an advocate for a single-payer healthcare system, commonly referred to as \"Medicare For All\". Although she concedes that the Affordable Care Act was \"a step in the right direction in many regards,\" she advocates for full implementation of a single-payer system that aims to guarantee universal low-cost medical services for all Americans.[21] As part of the platform for her campaign for the Arizona State Senate, she proposed expanding the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) to accommodate funding for the state's KidsCar and ALTCS programs.[22] Westbrook also holds a non-negotiable stance on access to women's health care, stating she would \"refuse to support legislation which would limit women\u2019s access to low-cost birth control, preventive screenings, procedures, and treatment, just to make sure that women also have no access to safe abortions.[21]\"\n\nEnvironment[edit]\nWestbrook has acknowledged that global warming is real and caused by human activity. She supports Tulsi Gabbard's Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act, which proposes ending fossil fuel subsidies, fully transitioning to clean energy sources for electrical generation, and requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.[23] She also advocates for policies which would invest in green technologies, such as solar and wind to increase their affordability[24] as well as promoting tax incentives for transitioning to renewable energy sources.[21] Her campaign for the Arizona State Senate advocated for the adoption of eco-friendly construction techniques and minimizing water usage.[22]\n\nMinimum wage[edit]\nWestbrook supports a transition to a national minimum wage of $15 per hour over a ten-year period, adjusted for inflation over time.[25]\n\nCampaign finance reform[edit]\nWestbrook supports amending the United States Constitution to nullify the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. FEC ruling.[24]\n\nAutomatic voter registration[edit]\nWestbrook is a supporter of automatic voter registration.[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Our Leadership\". Arizona Democratic Party.

White supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign but has since expressed reservations about him and his policies.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 YouTube career\n3 Personal life\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nWhite has described feeling gender dysphoria from a young age. At the age of 18, she was a victim of date rape by a man, which she later revealed in a video collaboration with Shane Dawson.[4] White's father died the following year. When she was 20 years old, she came out as transgender to her family and friends and began feminizing hormone therapy in 2015. White attended California State University, Chico, where she studied computer science. While attending college, she appeared on a friend's live stream, and commenters encouraged her to start a YouTube channel of her own.[2]\n\nYouTube career[edit]\nAfter she was dissatisfied with studying computer science at college, White began posting anti-feminist political videos on the platform in December 2015.[5] She continued making videos about her views on social issues like gender politics.[2][6][5] A doxxing fight broke out between White's supporters and supporters of Black Lives Matter when she criticized the social movement. She told Penthouse that she had to contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[5]\nWhite has uploaded her political debates with other YouTubers, commentators and comedians.[5] She has also appeared on political talk show The Rubin Report several times, discussing issues including the North Carolina Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which requires individuals to only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. She has also appeared on Shane and Friends, a video podcast hosted by Shane Dawson.[7]\nIn February 2017, White was banned from social networking platform Facebook for 30 days, drawing complaints from her supporters.[8] Her account was reinstated shortly afterwards, and Facebook said the ban was an error.[3] That same year, White started uploading videos about her personal life, including about her transitioning plastic surgeries.[5]\nOn November 11, 2017, White and her boyfriend filmed a video in which they wore hats bearing the Trump slogan \"Make America Great Again\" and attended an anti-Trump protest on Hollywood Boulevard. In the video, she claims to have been assaulted twice, and had a drink thrown in her face. Police say that White and her boyfriend began the altercation when they crossed a divider between pro- and anti-Trump protesters.[2][9] White has said that she would not wear a red hat in an American liberal area again because of the confrontation.[5]\nIn October 2020, White received criticism and backlash following a video she posted about transgender athlete Janae Marie Kroc. White falsely claimed that Kroc competes against cisgender women in powerlifting events and unfairly has won events as a result. Afterwards, Kroc responded on Instagram saying that \"everything she said about me was incorrect\". Kroc clarified that she has only ever competed before she transitioned, in the men's division, and that she has not competed and does not ever intend to compete against other women. On October 15, White apologized on Twitter and deleted the video from her YouTube channel.[10]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nWhite lives in Los Angeles.[2] She describes her political beliefs as center-right[3] and is non-religious, stating that religion has had little significance in her life.[11] White supported Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election but has stated she remains critical of some of his policies and actions in office.[12]\nIn June 2018, White announced her engagement to fellow YouTuber Joey Sarson.[13][5]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ White, Blaire (June 9, 2020).

He was assigned female at birth.[6] He was a sickly child, suffering from rickets. He was the middle child of the five children in his family. In 1955 the family lived in Wythenshawe. At that time, Wythenshawe was said to be the biggest council estate in Europe, providing workers for the Trafford Park estate. After several years of sun lamp treatment for his rickets, at St Mary's Hospital, he was considered well enough to attend Havely Hay Primary school at the age of five. In 1963, the family moved to Withington village, an inner suburb of Manchester. From the age of eight he attended Old Moat Junior school.\nIn 1966 his mother, Barbara Elizabeth Whittle (n\u00e9e Stead), being concerned at how different he was from his sisters, entered him in the examination for Withington Girls' School. Being one of the highest scorers in the city in the Eleven plus exam that year, he received a scholarship to attend. It was during his time at Withington Girls' School that he started reading medical books.[7] He knew he was romantically attached to other girls at school \u2013 he never told them, and so his love was not reciprocated \u2013 but he also knew that he was sexually attracted to men. On top of that was a strong desire to be a man, to grow a beard and to have a hairy chest. He had read articles about people like Della Aleksander and April Ashley who had had a sex change. In 1972, at the age of 16, whilst visiting his doctor about a sore throat he read about a trans man.[8]\n\nTransgender rights campaigning[edit]\nIn 1974 Whittle came out as a FTM trans man, after returning from a women's Liberation Conference in Edinburgh, which he attended as a member of the Manchester Lesbian Collective. He began hormone replacement therapy in 1975.[9] He has been active in transsexual and transgender communities since the age of twenty when in 1975 he joined the Manchester TV/TS group which had been started in 1972/3 by two trans women[10] the very first support group for transsexual people in the United Kingdom.[citation needed] In 1979 he joined a former army officer and then royal sculptor, Judy Couzins, a trans woman in the Self Help Association for Transsexuals (SHAFT).\nIn 1989, he founded the UK's FTM Network which he coordinated until November 2007.[11] In 1992, along with Mark Rees, the actress Myka Scott and an airline pilot Krystyna Sheffield, he founded and became vice-president of Press for Change that works to change the laws and social attitudes surrounding transgender and transsexual lives. Whittle remains as one of the vice-presidents (there is no president, as it is a consensus group), and Press for Change was called \"one of the most successful lobby groups seen in the last 25 years\" by Lord Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew as early as 1994 at the reading of his Gender Reassignment Bill. The bill failed but \"for 40 minutes members of parliament discussed trans people which without it, would have never happened.\"[citation needed] Whittle underwent phalloplasty surgeries from 2001 to 2003.[12] The Channel 4 documentary Make me a Man followed his life during the surgeries.[13]\nThough unable to marry legally in the United Kingdom until the passing of the Gender Recognition Act 2004, he and his partner (now wife), Sarah Rutherford, have four children by artificial insemination. Whittle wrote in Disembodied Law: Trans People's Legal(Outer) Space, \"I face an inadequate legal framework in which to exist. We are simply 'not' within a world that only permits two sexes, only allows two forms of gender role, gender identity or expression. Always falling outside of the 'norm' our lives become less, our humanity is questioned, and our oppression is legitimized.\"[14] The Whittles' efforts to gain recognition of Stephen as their children's legal father led to X, Y and Z v. The United Kingdom before the European Court of Human Rights in 1996.[9][15] When the Gender Recognition Act 2004 came into force in April 2005, Whittle obtained a new, male birth certificate. He then married Sarah (n\u00e9e Rutherford) later that year.[15] They had been cohabiting since 1979.[9] They have four children by artificial insemination, the first of whom was born on 13 October 1992.[9][15] In April 2006, they jointly adopted the children, making Whittle their legal father.\nHe has written and spoken extensively on his personal journey, most notably in his autobiographical statement in Will Self's essay for David Gamble's photography collection 'Perfidious Man.'[16] His writings have included, among other things, an article on the ground-breaking transsexual employment discrimination case decided on by the European Court of Justice. In 2005 he was awarded The Sylvia Rivera Award for Transgender Studies by the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies for the monograph 'Respect and Equality.' In 2007, along with his co-editor, Susan Stryker, he was awarded a Lambda Literary Award for their annotated collection of 50 key historical and contemporary transgender science, political and theory texts; 'The Transgender Studies Reader'.\nIn 2002, Whittle was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Having experienced a variety of health problems since his early 20s, he had had suspicions and was neither surprised nor terrified by the diagnosis.[citation needed] His multiple sclerosis has been an increasing problem since late 2005, yet he continues in his full-time university post, and his fight for the human rights of trans people throughout he world.[17] In recent years, he has collaborated with other members; Paisley Currah, Shannon Minter and Alyson Meiselmann, of the World Professional Association of Transgender Health WPATH on amicus briefs to courts in many jurisdictions. In 2007, he was the first non-medical professional and first trans person to become President of WPATH.[18] Whittle continues to write extensively on the law and policy surrounding transsexual and transgender people, along with several recent academic articles returning to the question of the law and trans people. He also continues to work on what he hopes will be the defining history of transgender, and the sources of the many theories surrounding gender variant people. Throughout his life he has maintained an interest in the avant-garde of the arts, and has started to collaborate with Sara Davidmann, a photographer and Lecturer in Fine Art at Wimbledon College of Art.\nIn early 2007, the research report Engendered Penalties: Transsexual and Transgender People\u2019s Experience of Inequality and Discrimination[19] was instrumental in ensuring the inclusion of trans people in the remit of the new Commission for Equalities and Human Rights.[20]\n\nHonours[edit]\nIn 2002, Whittle was given the Human Rights Award by the Civil Rights group Liberty, for his commitment and dedication to ensuring the advancement of rights for transsexual people through judicial means in the UK, Europe, and around the world.[15]\nIn the 2005 New Year Honours, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \"for services to Gender Issues\".[21]\nIn 2006, he was awarded the Virginia Prince Lifetime Achievement Award by the USA's International Federation for Gender Education.[failed verification]\nIn March 2015, Whittle was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences (FAcSS).[22]\n\nRoles[edit]\nPress for Change founder and Vice-president\nFTM Network [1], founder and coordinator[citation needed]\nProfessor of Equalities Law at Manchester Metropolitan University.[2]\nWritings[edit]\nBooks[edit]\n(with Turner, L.)

Only a few months after her SRS (Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female) the Army terminated her service in May 2003, effectively firing her.  This was in total disregard to their own \"new guidelines/instruction AGAI 76\" on the issue of \"transition within the Army\" issued especially to protect people like her.

In 2016, she began the ContraPoints channel in reaction to the Gamergate controversy and the increasing prevalence of right-wing YouTubers, shifting her content to countering their arguments.[2][5][8][9] Early ContraPoints videos also covered subjects such as race, racism, and online radicalisation.[2] In her videos, Wynn uses philosophy, sociology, and personal experience to explain left-wing ideas and to criticize common conservative, classical liberal, alt-right and fascist talking points.[5][10][11]\nWynn's videos often have a combative but humorous tone, containing dark and surreal humor, sarcasm and sexual themes.[5] Wynn often illustrates concepts by playing different characters who engage in debate.[12] The videos have been noted for showcasing Wynn's production choices such as complicated lighting, elaborate costumes, and aesthetics.[13] She takes aesthetic cues from drag performance, saying in a 2019 interview that if conservatives were going to call her a drag queen anyway, she decided to \"be the most extravagant drag queen on YouTube.\"[14] In a 2018 interview for The Verge, Katherine Cross notes a significant difference between Wynn and how she presents on YouTube, explaining that the YouTube channel portrays an image of being \"blithe, aloof, decadent and disdainful\", while personally Wynn \"can be earnest\u2014and she cares deeply, almost too much.\"[15]\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be the person who was just making videos about social justice videos on YouTube... to me it was like, I may as well be lecturing again. I tried that and I hated it and I don\u2019t want to be that person.\u2014\u2009Natalie Wynn[16]\nThe video channel is financed through the crowdfunding platform Patreon, where ContraPoints has been among the top 20 creators on the site.[17]\nIn February 2020, Wynn set all her videos from before August 2017\u2014when she began her gender transition\u2014to private saying that they \"no longer represent the person I've become\".[18] She posted transcripts of the majority of these videos on her website.[19]\n\nReception[edit]\nWynn's videos have been praised for their clarity, nuance, and attention-grabbing sense of humor.[2][12] Jake Hall, writing for Vice, called Wynn \"one of the most incisive and compelling video essayists on YouTube\".[2] In an article contrasting her personal sincerity and her ironic sense of humor, The Verge describes her as the \"Oscar Wilde of YouTube.\"[15] New York magazine states, \"ContraPoints is very good. Regardless of the viewer's interest or lack thereof in internet culture wars, YouTube Nazis, or any of the other wide-ranging subjects covered in its videos, they're funny, bizarre, erudite, and compelling.\"[5]  Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs calls ContraPoints a \"one-woman blitzkrieg against the YouTube right,\" describing her videos as \"unlike anything I've ever seen ... She shows how debate should be done: not by giving an inch to poisonous ideas, but by bringing superior smarts, funnier jokes, and more elegant costumes to the fight.\"[12]\nMedia often describe the channel's content as uniquely suited to a millennial audience, due to its humorous style and its direct attention to online culture.[12][13][20] Wynn's analysis of fascists' use of memes and coded symbols has been cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center in an article explaining the right-wing use of the OK sign.[11] Journalist Liza Featherstone recommends the channel as well, saying that Wynn does a \"fabulous job\" acknowledging her opponents' valid points while debunking weak arguments and revealing the influence of a sometimes-unacknowledged far-right political agenda.[21]\nIn November 2018, after a ContraPoints video about incels reached over one million views, The New Yorker released a profile of the channel, describing Wynn as \"one of the few Internet demi-celebrities who is as clever as she thinks she is, and one of the few leftists anywhere who can be nuanced without being boring.\"[22] The Atlantic praised Wynn's use of \"lush sets, moody lighting, and original music by the composer Zo\u00eb Blade\" and opined of her videos that \"The most spectacular attraction [...] is Wynn herself.\"[20] Polygon named her video on incels one of the ten best video essays of the year 2018.[6] In May 2019, she topped the Dazed 100 list, which ranks people who \"dared to give culture a shot in the arm.\"[23]\nIn September 2019, Wynn described on Twitter feelings of awkwardness when asked in some contexts to describe her preferred gender pronouns.[24] The tweets were criticized as dismissive of non-binary people who use pronouns other than \"he/him\" and \"she/her\".[25] Contrastingly, professor Lal Zimman opined about pronoun introductions, \"Wynn is absolutely right that people engage with that practice in ways that can be somewhat problematic\".[24] Following negative reaction, Wynn deactivated her Twitter account for a week, then posted an apology.[25]\nIn October 2019, Wynn's video \"Opulence\" featured a quote from John Waters read by transsexual pornographic actor Buck Angel,[26] whose views on transgender people have attracted criticism, including by some who see Angel's views as being transmedicalist.[25][26] Wynn was criticised for featuring Angel, including by journalist Ana Valens. In addition to criticism, Wynn and YouTubers associated with her were widely harassed.[25][26] Wynn's January 2020 video \"Canceling\" addressed both criticism and harassment of her, and the broader context of perceived \"cancel culture\". It was praised by Robby Soave of Reason.[27]\nThe ContraPoints channel was nominated for Best Commentary at the 10th Annual Streamy Awards.[28]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nWynn is a trans woman, a matter that features heavily in her videos, and began her gender transition in 2017.[5] Wynn previously identified as genderqueer.[29] She is a feminist and a socialist.[12][15][22][30] As of 2017[update], she resides in Baltimore, Maryland.[5] In 2020, Wynn came out as a lesbian in her video \"Shame\".[31]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward Giving Body\n\nCategory\n\nWork\n\nResults\n\nRef.\n\n\n2020\n\nStreamy Award\n\nBest Commentary\n\nContrapoints\n\nPending\n\n[28]\n\n\nWOWIE Awards\n\nOutstanding YouTube\n\nPending\n\n[32]\n\nSee also[edit]\nBreadTube\nHbomberguy\nInnuendo Studios\nPhilosophy Tube\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ @ContraPoints (July 19, 2018). \"Alright, alright astrologers.

Sophie is known for her synthesised and \"hyperkinetic\"[5] take on pop music, and came to prominence with singles such as \"Bipp\" (2013) and \"Lemonade\" (2014). Her compilation Product was released in 2015, and the debut album Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides followed in 2018. The latter earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album. Sophie has worked closely with artists from the PC Music label, including A.G. Cook and GFOTY, and has produced for acts such as Madonna, Charli XCX, Vince Staples, Let's Eat Grandma, Kim Petras, Flume, Namie Amuro and Itzy.\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n\n1.1 Origins and early years\n1.2 2015\u20132017: Product and breakthrough\n1.3 2017\u2013present: Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides\n\n\n2 Sound and image\n3 Identity\n4 Discography\n5 Awards and nominations\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nOrigins and early years[edit]\nSophie was born and grew up in Glasgow, Scotland.[10][1][2] Starting at a very young age, her father would play cassettes of electronic music in the car and take her to raves, and she quickly became enamoured with the music. Describing her childhood in an interview published by Lenny Letter, she revealed, \"I spent all my time listening to those cassette tapes. I'd steal them from the car.\" After receiving a keyboard as a birthday gift, she then began to create her own music. By the time she was approximately nine or ten years old, she confessed to her parents that she wanted to drop out of school to be an electronic music producer (although they did not let her do so and she continued her schooling). She continued to create music throughout her adolescence, even regularly announcing, \"I'm just going to lock myself in my room until I've made an album.\" When Sophie was still a child, she started to DJ weddings and birthdays. Her half-sister asked Sophie to DJ her wedding, as Sophie admitted that her half-sister \"didn't know what I was doing in my room on my own\" and had assumed she was a DJ. This was when she started learning to DJ in addition to production.[11]\nSophie began her adult music career in a band named Motherland (with bandmates Sabine Gottfried, Matthew Lutz-Kinoy, and Marcella Dvsi), and later collaborated with her bandmate Matthew Lutz-Kinoy on a series of performance works.[12] In 2011, she scored the short film Dear Mr/Mrs by Dutch team Freudenthal/Verhagen.[13] Sophie became involved with artists affiliated with the PC Music label after encountering Dux Kidz, a project between A. G. Cook and Danny L Harle.[14]\nSophie released her debut single \"Nothing More to Say\" in February 2013 via the London-based Glaswegian label Huntleys + Palmers. The single featuring vocals from UK songstress Jaide Green consisted of two mixes of the titular track (titled the \"Dub\" and \"Vox\"), as well as the B-side, \"Eeehhh\", which was initially posted on (and later deleted from) Sophie's SoundCloud in 2011. Its follow-up, \"Bipp\"/\"Elle\"\u2014which had been released on SoundCloud as previews in the previous year along with a third track \"OOH\"\u2014was released on Numbers later that year.[13] \"Bipp\" in particular, featuring vocals from Sophie's former Motherland bandmate Marcella Dvsi, received considerable attention from music critics, topping XLR8R's year-end list and placing 17 on Pitchfork's.[15][16] Pitchfork later ranked \"Bipp\" 56 on its list of the best tracks from 2010\u20132014.[17] In mid-2014, Sophie collaborated with Japanese pop singer Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.[18] Also in 2014, Sophie collaborated with A. G. Cook and the US-based artist Hayden Dunham for the project QT, co-producing her debut single \"Hey QT\" with the former. The project included a fictional energy drink called the QT Energy Elixir. At the singer's request, \"Hey QT\" repeats the drink's name for product placement.[19]\n\n Sophie (left) produced \"Hey QT\" with A. G. Cook (right).\nSophie's next single, \"Lemonade\"/\"Hard\", was released in August 2014, with vocal contributions on the former from fellow musician Nabihah Iqbal (AKA Throwing Shade) [20]and model Tess Yopp and vocal contributions on the latter from PC Music artist GFOTY. Numbers released \"Lemonade\"/\"Hard\" as a 12\" single.[21] Both tracks appeared on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time charts.[4] \"Lemonade\" and \"Hard\" placed 68th and 91st respectively on the 2014 Pazz & Jop critics poll, and the single was included in the top ten of year-end singles lists by The Washington Post, Resident Advisor, Complex, and Pitchfork;[22][23][24][25] \"Hard\" was included in the top ten on lists by Dazed and Dummy.[26][27] \"Lemonade\" appeared in a 2015 commercial for McDonald's.[28]\n\n2015\u20132017: Product and breakthrough[edit]\nIn March 2015, Charli XCX announced a collaboration with Sophie. It was later revealed that the pair had worked on multiple songs for her upcoming studio album.[29] In September 2015, Sophie's debut album Product was made available for preorder. The eight tracks listed were the four Numbers singles from 2013 and 2014, as well as four new tracks: \"MSMSMSM\", \"Vyzee\", \"L.O.V.E.\", and \"Just Like We Never Said Goodbye\". \"MSMSMSM\" was released on 29 September,[30] and \"Just Like We Never Said Goodbye\" followed on 15 October.[31]\nIn February 2016, Charli XCX released her Vroom Vroom EP, produced primarily by Sophie.[32] It was later revealed that the extended play would act as a teaser for XCX's upcoming album, which would be produced by Sophie. After the extended play's release, Sophie embarked on tour with Charli XCX in promotion of their new music. Sophie, along with A. G. Cook and Hannah Diamond, also involved with the EP, received cameos in the official video for the lead single, \"Vroom Vroom\". The video was premiered on Apple Music and other platforms soon after.\nIn late 2016, Sophie acted as an additional producer on Charli XCX's song \"After the Afterparty\", which features vocals from Lil Yachty. Sophie cameos in the single's official music video. Sophie also received production credits for two songs on XCX's 2017 mixtape Number 1 Angel, and another for one song on XCX's second mixtape of 2017, Pop 2 which was released later that year.\nIn January 2017, it was announced that Sophie was working with record producer Cashmere Cat. She appears on \"Love Incredible\", alongside former Fifth Harmony member Camila Cabello, and \"9 (After Coachella)\" with M\u00d8.\n\n2017\u2013present: Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides[edit]\nIn October 2017, Sophie made her solo musical comeback with a new single, \"It's Okay to Cry\", the first new material she released in almost two years. The music video for the song was the first time she used her voice and image in her work. She subsequently opened up to the press about being a transgender woman.[33] Later in the month, she also made her debut live performance, where she premiered newly-recorded songs from her second album with vocal performances by Cecile Believe. One of the songs, \"Ponyboy\", premiered on Australian radio station Triple J, and the song was released with a self-directed music video on 7 December 2017. The third single from the album, \"Faceshopping\", was released on 16 February 2018 with a music video on 4 April 2018.[34]\nOn 3 April 2018, Sophie announced via Instagram that her album was complete, and that it is not titled Whole New World as previously thought.[35] On 1 May 2018, an interview with Crack Magazine revealed that the official album title is Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides. It was released on 15 June 2018[36] by her own label, MSMSMSM, along with Future Classic and Transgressive. In early 2018, she revealed in a tweet that she contributed to and produced Lady Gaga's latest album. In a video posted up on social media, when asked, she said: \"Yes. I mean whatever, you know. I work on a lot of different things. If it comes out, then it's cool. You can never tell. But she's a really cool person.\"[37]\nIn July 2018, she revealed that she has worked on four new projects, including her newly-released debut album, which are all going to be released that year. She said, \"I have the next one finished... I'm going to release four albums this year\". She has even stated in an interview with Lenny Letter that she has done so much collaborating with other people that, \"Basically, I've done a whole new album in the last two weeks.\" When asked to clarify whether she meant EPs or albums, she stated that it would be \"a mix\". She has also been working with Kim Petras, Charli XCX and Bibi Bourelly on new material within the year, as well as some rap collaborations in addition to the confirmed Lady Gaga collaboration.[38][39][40]\nDuring a red carpet interview at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Sophie confirmed that she is working on a remix album on alternative versions of her Grammy-nominated debut album Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides.[41] She had been nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album, and has made history as both one of the first openly transgender artists to be nominated in this category and one of the three first openly transgender women to be nominated for a Grammy.[42]\nIn July 2019, the aforementioned remix album was announced as part of an exclusive 3-CD set that includes the original Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides album as well as a clutch bag featuring its artwork.[43] The remix album was later released as two videos on YouTube on 29 July.[44]\n\nSound and image[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\"Bipp\" (2013)\n\n\"Bipp\" features a pitch-shifted vocal over a minimal rhythm that uses a flanging effect.[45]\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\nSophie primarily uses the Elektron Monomachine and Ableton Live to create music.[46] Instead of sampling, instrumentals are built from waveforms.[4] Likening the construction of a track to building a sculpture out of different materials, Sophie uses the Monomachine to create sounds resembling \"latex, balloons, bubbles, metal, plastic, [and] elastic.\"[4][46][47] AllMusic wrote that Sophie's \"sophisticated, hyperkinetic productions\" feature a \"surrealist, blatantly artificial quality\", typically making use of high-pitched female vocals in addition to \"sugary synthesizer textures, and beats drawing from underground dance music styles.\"[5] The New York Times described Sophie's work as \"giddy fun, but [...] also an invitation to consider pop's pleasures, structures and gender expectations, and pop's commercial status as both a consumer item and an emotional catalyst.\"[48] The Fader likened it to \"K-Pop, J-Pop, Eurodance at its most chaotic, and even turn of the millennium American/UK boybandisms.\"[49] When Billboard asked Sophie what genre her music falls under, she replied \"advertising\".[2]\nSophie's early visuals came from a series of colourful images she refers to as \"Homemade Molecular Cooking\".[13] Her singles' cover art often depicts objects made from plastic or other industrial materials, an idea that originated from discussions with John Roberts, a fellow electronic musician.[50] At the POPcube event, Sophie unveiled posters and postcards outlining the products to be offered through her online store, which included a set of wedge heels, a puffa jacket, and unique sunglasses. Although these products were offered for sale when the album was released, they were immediately sold out except for a \"body safe silicone product\" bundled with a special edition album, raising suspicions that these auxiliary products were never real.\n\nIdentity[edit]\nSophie has been described as a reclusive figure, and remained anonymous for some time, concealing her identity in interviews by masking her voice or covering parts of herself.[13][18] Early in her career, her real-life identity was the subject of press speculation. A 2013 Pitchfork feature said that Sophie was \"assumed to be male\". In an e-mail interview, when asked about her choice of 'Sophie' as a stage name, she responded \"It tastes good and it's like moisturizer.\"[13] At one Boiler Room show, drag performer Ben Woozy was recruited to mime a DJ set while Sophie pretended to be a bodyguard.[51]\nIn 2015, around the time of the release of her debut album Product, news outlets began reporting that the person behind the 'Sophie' moniker was a London-based producer named Samuel Long.[52][53]\nPrior to the revelation that she was a trans woman, some commentators accused Sophie of \"feminine appropriation\", on the assumption that she was a man using a female stage name in a field where women are underrepresented.[54] A 2014 article in The Fader criticized her and PC Music collaborator A. G. Cook for using stereotypically feminine aesthetics in their work while enjoying male privilege.[55] In a widely quoted 2015 interview with The Guardian, female singer and producer Grimes expressed a similar view:\n\nIt's really fucked up to call yourself Sophie and pretend you're a girl when you're a male producer [and] there are so few female producers... I think it's really good music. I probably shouldn't have said that.[56]\nIn October 2017, Sophie released the music video for \"It's Okay to Cry\", in which she used her own voice and image in her work for the first time, appearing nude from the bust up against a backdrop of clouds. This was widely interpreted as her coming out as a trans woman.[33] She has confirmed her trans identity in subsequent interviews, though she has spoken of feeling boxed-in by labels, describing her music as her \"chosen method of communication\" and self-expression.[57]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nMain article: Sophie discography\nOil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides (2018)\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward\n\nCategory\n\nWork\n\nResult\n\n\n2018\n\nAIM Independent Music Awards[58][59]\n\nUK Breakthrough of the Year\n\nHerself\n\nNominated\n\n\nInnovator Award\n\nWon\n\n\nIndependent Album of the Year\n\nOil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides\n\nNominated\n\n\n2019\n\nGrammy Award\n\nBest Dance/Electronic Album\n\nNominated\n\n\nLibera Award[60]\n\nBest Dance/Electronic Album\n\nNominated\n\n\n2020\n\nAIM Independent Music Awards[61]\n\nBest Creative Packaging\n\nOil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides Non-Stop Remix Album\n\nNominated\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Mougin, Marie (4 September 2018). \"SOPHIE, le nouveau ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de la sc\u00e8ne pop exp\u00e9rimentale et underground\".
