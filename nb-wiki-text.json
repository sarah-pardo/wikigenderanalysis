After the show, she signed to BMG Australia (now Sony Music Australia), and she released her debut single, \"Rub Me Wrong\",  which peaked at No. 29 on the ARIA Singles Chart[4][5] and eventually gained a gold certification, ten years after its release. While auditioning for Australian Idol, she also became the first LGBTQ contestant to openly appear on a reality TV talent show.[6] In 2014, Courtney was one of the runners-up in season six of RuPaul's Drag Race. In June 2019, a panel of judges from New York magazine placed her third on their list of \"the most powerful drag queens in America\", a ranking of 100 former Drag Race contestants.[7]\nIn 2014, Courtney returned to recording music and released the extended play Kaleidoscope (2015), which included the title-track which was the official song for the 2016 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Courtney began performing in drag girl-group, The AAA Girls, released several singles and embarked on the North American, Access All Areas Tour (2015). In January 2018, Courtney appeared on season 21 of Celebrity Big Brother UK and ultimately won the series with 49.43% of the final public vote.[8] She began branching into a hosting career, hosting The Bi Life, the UK's first bisexual reality dating show, on E! and her own television special, The Courtney Act Show. Courtney released \"Fight for Love\" in late 2018, in hope to represent Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, however she was beaten.\nIn 2019, Courtney competed and was runner-up on season 16 of the Australian version of Dancing with the Stars, where she was paired with Joshua Keefe. This made Courtney and Keefe the first same-sex pairing in the history of the Australian version, as well as the second same-sex pairing on any version of the show.[9] Courtney/Jenek prefers the pronoun she when referring to Courtney and he when referring to Jenek.[10]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Beginnings and Australian Idol\n2.2 Record deal and RuPaul's Drag Race\n2.3 Reality television and return to music\n2.4 Dancing with the Stars and Neighbours\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 Discography\n\n4.1 Extended plays\n4.2 Singles\n\n4.2.1 As lead artist\n4.2.2 As featured artist\n\n\n4.3 Other appearances\n\n\n5 Tours\n6 Filmography\n\n6.1 Film\n6.2 Television\n6.3 Web series\n6.4 Music videos\n6.5 Music video appearances\n\n\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nJenek was born in Brisbane, Australia, and moved to Sydney at age 18.[11] He was born to Gill and Annette Jenek and he has an older sister named Kim.[12] Growing up, Jenek would always dress up and sing and dance. In 1987, he entered a competition, Tiny Tots, which was a charity pageant show for children.[12] At a young age, Jenek began attending The Fame Talent School where he became close friends with twins Lisa Origliasso and Jessica Origliasso, who would late become The Veronicas.[12] The group would perform together for twelve years. Jenek found school difficult due to bullying over his sexuality.[12] He began to think something was wrong with him during his teenage years. Jenek received high grades at school and he was going to study medicine to become a doctor instead of an entertainer.[12] He first attended the Stonewall Club in the mid-90s and Jenek states that was the start of his \"big queer life\".[12] He originally intended to take the name Ginger Le'Bon and be a \"redheaded, smoky voiced nightclub singer.\"[13] Instead, he took the stage name Courtney Act, which is a pun on the phrase caught in the act as pronounced in a non-rhotic accent such as Australian English.[14] When growing up, Jenek couldn't identify with anything that was portrayed in the media.[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\nBeginnings and Australian Idol[edit]\nJenek's drag queen career began in 2002 when he met Sydney drag queen, Vanity Fair.[12] He was intrigued by the visual and feminine allusion Fair would create once he was in drag and this inspired him to begin his drag career.[12] His decided upon the stage name Courtney Act, as in a non-rhotic accent like the Australian accent, the phrase \"caught in the act\" is said.[12] Courtney stated back in 2002 when he began drag, you had to \"fight\" and \"earn\" your place as a drag queen.[12] He entered Diva Rising Star competition in 2002 and won.[12]\nIn 2003, Courtney auditioned for the inaugural season of Australian Idol. He first appeared as Jenek, but the judges, Ian Dickson, Marcia Hines and Mark Holden, told Jenek that his voice was \"just not up to it\".[12] The following day, Jenek returned to audition but as Courtney Act.[12] Hines said that Courtney was \"great\". Dickson said, \"Shane only didn't just cut it. You've added another dimension and this time you've blown us away.\"[12] Courtney continued through the competition and reached the live finals.[12] The first TV vote, Courtney didn't get through, however the judges brought her back as one of the wildcards.[12] During his time on the show he performed songs such as: \"I Am Woman\" by Helen Reddy, \"You Don't Own Me\" by Lesley Gore and \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" by AC/DC. Courtney came thirteenth on the show, but remained highly anticipated throughout Australia. At the time, Jenek was the first and only LGBT contestant to openly appear on a reality TV talent show.[6]\n\nRecord deal and RuPaul's Drag Race[edit]\nAfter the completion of the first season of Australian Idol, Courtney went on tour with the finalist of the show. It was in 2003, Courtney signed a major record deal with BMG Australia now known as Sony Music Australia. Courtney released her debut single \"Rub Me Wrong\" the following year in March 2004, where the song reached a peak of number 29 on the ARIA Charts and gaining a gold certification by the charts. However, due to the low charting figures of the song, BMG Australia decided to put Courtney's debut album on hold. Courtney returned to the club scene and began working with the up-and-coming Lady Gaga.[12] In August 2011, Jenek moved to West Hollywood, California in order to find further success.\n\nRuPaul is there in the room, what you see on TV is all of what you get, there is not anything beyond that. There is no friendship. I\u2019ve chosen to focus on that legend of RuPaul, just like with everyone there is the legend and there is the human. When RuPaul blocked me [on Twitter] that was it.\" Courtney on her feud with RuPaul[15]\nIn December 2013, Logo TV announced that Courtney was among the 14 drag queens who would be competing on the sixth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[16] Courtney is the only ever queen to be featured on the show to be from Australia. Courtney did not feature in the first episode of season 6 due to the show being split into two openings. During the third episode, the week's challenge was to act in a horror movie, the original and the sequel. Courtney is ultimately given positive feedback and declared safe. Episode 4 featured Courtney as the main challenge winner.[17] The main challenge was to perform in Shade: The Rusical\". Courtney was praised for her \"strong\" singing voice and acting skills.[17] The fifth episode features the Snatch Game, which is a spoof of The Match Game.\nDuring the episode the drag queens have to impersonate a celebrity, which Courtney impersonated Fran Drescher and she was ultimate declared safe. The following show, Courtney had to record a version of RuPaul's song, \"Oh No She Betta Don't!\" from his album, again Courtney was declared safe. During the seventh episode, the queens had to create a commercial advert for RuPaul's new product, Glamazon by Colorevolution, working in a team with Joslyn Fox. The pair got negative critiques from the judges, with Santino Rice, saying the pair shouldn't rely on pretty and that they could have taken it \"further\".[17] The next episode would see the queens being tested on their comedy, Courtney, who announced on the show she was nervous about the challenge because she does not see herself as a \"comedy queen\". Ultimately, Courtney was declared safe for the episode. The ninth episode's challenge, the queens had to host their own talk show and interview celebrity guest: Cher's son Chaz Bono and her mother, Georgia Holt.[17] Courtney was praised by all the judges and through the show, Courtney and Bono made a friendship, which resulted in Bono inviting Courtney to perform in the musical he was producing.[17] Courtney also won the ninth episode challenge. The tenth episode saw a makeover challenge, which the queens had to make grooms to be, into the bride. Courtney was declared safe. The following few episodes, Courtney was announced as safe and would proceed to the final as the top 3. Courtney was the fourth contestant during its six seasons not to have fallen into the bottom two throughout the competition. She placed as a joint runner-up alongside Adore Delano, behind winner Bianca Del Rio.\n\nReality television and return to music[edit]\nIn July 2014, Courtney became the first drag performer in history to sing live with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Courtney appeared as a guest performer with Cheyenne Jackson in \"Hello, Gorgeous! Cheyenne Jackson Goes to the Movies\". The two sang a duet of \"Elephant Love Song\" from the 2001 Baz Luhrmann film Moulin Rouge![18] In September 2014, Courtney, along with Willam Belli and Alaska Thunderfuck 5000, were the first drag queens to become ad girls for American Apparel, known as The AAA Girls, also becoming the first drag queens to feature in RuPaul's Drag Race to form a drag girl-group. She worked for the campaign Support Artists, Support Ethical Manufacturing of the fashion brand, featuring three limited exclusive T-shirts that honour each drag queen's talents and allure.[19] The group released their debut single \"American Apparel Ad Girls\" in late 2014 a parody of \"Farrah Fawcett Hair\" by Capital Cities.[20] The song charted at number 10 on the Billboard Comedy Digital songs chart,[21] the song would later feature in Belli's solo album, Shartistry in Motion (2014). In December 2015, the group released a Christmas song, \"Dear Santa, Bring Me a Man\", which was featured in the first Christmas Queens (2015). The album also seen Courtney cover a solo version of \"Twelve Days of Christmas\" and The AAA Girls, also recorded a second song featured on the compilation album, \"Christmas Sweater\". Again in June 2015, the group reunited to record for Alaska's debut studio album, Anus (2015), where the group collaborated on the track, \"The Shade of It All\".[22] Together with business partner and fellow drag queen Vanity Faire, Courtney operates Wigs by Vanity; they started the company in 2003 with the aim of producing wigs for drag queens.[23]\n\n The AAA Girls performing in Denver, 2017.\nThe following year in July 2015, Courtney returned to recording solo career and created the extended play Kaleidoscope (2015).[24] The album generally received positives critics and it saw release of lead single \"Ecstasy\". Followed by \"Ugly\", \"Body Parts\" and the title track song, \"Kaleidoscope\". The latter featured as the official song for the 2016 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.[25] Courtney stated: \"I feel that gender and sexuality are fluid and so often we get stuck in the rigidity. Who knows when someone outside your usual target zone might come also and sweep you off your feet? I read this quote from Lily Edelstein the other day it is seemed fitting \u201cAt the heart of Queer culture is revolution. The truest rebellion against a world built on categories, labels and binaries is coming from the emergence of identities that refuse to conform.\u201d.[25] In 2016, Courtney was the foreign correspondent for the Australian news website, Junkee. Courtney covered the US Presidential election 2016 for the site, attending rallies of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Following Trump's election, Courtney also participated in and reported on the 2017 Women's March.[26]\nIn late 2017, Courtney made a return to reality television and appeared in Single AF, with Marnie Simpson, which is a celebrity dating show, broadcast on MTV UK.[27] In February 2018, Courtney was appointed one of two Fringe Ambassadors at the Adelaide Fringe, presenting the show Under the Covers there.[28] In 2017, Courtney reunited with The AAA Girls for the Access All Areas Tour (2017). The tour was announced August 2017, a month after the release of their EP. Produced by Fullscreen Live,[29] the tour played 15 cities in the United States and Canada. The show was promoted as a full production with full staging, costume changes and choreography. As a thank you, the group live called fans, on Instagram, who purchased tickets. The Squared Division served are creative directors and Jae Fusz serves as choreographer.[30]\nIn 2018, Courtney entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, the day after New Years Day, and remained in the house for 32 days and eventually winning the season, beating Ann Widdecombe. Jenek appeared as both Courtney and himself, throughout the season being referred to \"him\" out of drag and \"her\" in drag.[31] Following Courtney's win on Big Brother, her popularity continued to grow in the United Kingdom and tabloid newspaper The Sun published a report on 21 November 2018 claiming that Courtney would receive \u00a350,000 for appearing in a programme entitled The Courtney Act Show; Channel 4 confirmed the programme two days later, with Courtney saying that she would be \"working with some of [her] favourite artists\".[32][33] which was broadcast on Christmas Eve of 2018. The show features performances from Bianca Del Rio, Adore Delano, Darienne Lake and Leona Lewis.[34] Jenek also hosted the dating reality show The Bi Life, appearing both as Courtney Act and Shane, and which premiered in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 25 October 2018 on E![35][36][37] Courtney competed with the song \"Fight for Love\" on Eurovision - Australia Decides in February 2019 to represent Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, but was not successful, losing out to Kate Miller-Heidke, with the song \"Zero Gravity\".[38] The show received positive reviews.[38]\n\nDancing with the Stars and Neighbours[edit]\nIn 2019, Courtney competed in the 16th season of the Australian version of Dancing with the Stars, partnered with Joshua Keefe, where they came second.[9] Courtney is the first drag performer in the history of the Dancing with the Stars franchise,[39] but not the first to perform in a same-sex pairing[40] \u2013 fashion designer Giovanni Ciacci\u00a0[it] and professional dancer Raimondo Todaro\u00a0[it] reached the grand final in the series of Ballando con le Stelle, the show's Italian counterpart.[41] Keefe was visibly surprised when Jenek arrived for their first meeting, before realising that he is the alter-ego of Courtney.[9] Jenek and Keefe dance as a same-sex pairing in the rehearsal footage for each week's performance[40] and he has expressed a desire to perform as Jenek as well, according to Gay Star News.[42] Courtney and Keefe topped the leader board with their performance in the first episode.[40]\nOn 1 March 2019, it was announced that Courtney had filmed a guest role as herself in the Australian soap opera Neighbours.

Their work has been featured in Duckie, Bar Wotever, And What! Festival, Hamburg International Feminist Festival, Late at Tate, the V&A, and Transmission Gallery.[5][6] They are currently the youngest person to be awarded a residency at The Tate in 2017/2018.[1]\nIn 2016, Alabanza starred in the five star roundhouse production of Putting Words in Your Mouth by Scottee and became one of the 2016\u20132017 Artists in Residence at the Tate Britain. In 2017, they began working on a solo exhibition, The Other'd Artist for Transmission Gallery in Glasgow.[5] Alabanza released their first chapbook titled Before I Step Outside. (You Love Me); a compilation of visual art, poetry, diary entries, and essays.[7][8] They also performed the leading role in the stage adaptation of Derek Jarman's punk film Jubilee.[9]\nAlabanza has critiqued mainstream feminism  for having been rooted in transphobia and mainstream feminists for often neglecting trans and gender non-conforming people in their discussions of progress.[10]\nIn 2018, Alabanza started a new show called Burgerz.[11] This show focuses on audience participation regarding an incident in 2016 where a person threw a burger at them while walking across a bridge in London.[12][1] The show ran its UK Tour from October 19 to November 17 in 2018.[13]\nIn 2019, Alabanza and Kaulbach, childhood friends, collaborated on an immersive installation titled All the Ways We Could Grow [14]. The installation explores the question, 'What's it like to be trans?'[15] while also provoking exploration into the calmness one experiences in their safe place, their bedroom. Disguised as a sleepover with pink satin sheets and pillows, the audience is encourage to take the space and imagine/reflect. The installation challenges the need for gender in society through works of imagery and poetry.   \n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAlabanza was born in Bristol and grew up on a council estate.[16]\nThey started making their art when they were 16 years old, helping them work through and process what adversities they were facing as a black, queer person.[17] Alabanza began with their poems just as drafts on their phone, thinking they'd never show them to anyone else. After getting the burger thrown at them, they got fed up with keeping their feelings to themselves and presented their poems to their friend who was going through the same issues, which made Alabanza decide to make their works public.[18]\nAlabanza identifies as black, trans feminine, gender non-conforming, and uses the pronouns they/them.[19][20] Alabanza speaks out for trans rights and the importance of safe spaces and communities for gender non-conforming and transgender people.[21]\nIn November 2017, Alabanza was denied access to a female dressing room while shopping at Topshop in Manchester, the fashion retailer owned by Sir Philip Green. Alabanza was told to use the men's dressing room.[22] They left the store and filed a complaint through social media.[23] Alabanza accused Topshop of going against their policy to allow trans individuals to use the dressing rooms associated with their preferred gender.[24][25] The Times published an opinion piece by Janice Turner, incorrectly implying that Topshop's policy was changed because of Alabanza's tweet and claiming the policy would lead to child abuse[26][9]. Subsequently, Alabanza received online death threats over Topshop's policy.

They have written a number of anti self-help books on the topics of relationships, sex, and gender, as well as the graphic non-fiction books, Queer: A Graphic History and Gender: A Graphic Guide, and the book The Psychology of Sex.

After teaching at  a number of higher education institutions Barker settled at the Open University in 2008, having also qualified with an MA in Psychotherapy from the University of Sheffield and trained at the major NHS sexual and relationship clinic at Guy's Hospital for several years.\n\nRecent career[edit]\nBarker's   main area of expertise is human sexuality, gender and romantic relationships, with a focus on the experiences of people in sexual, gender and relationship communities located outside the mainstream \u2013 particularly polyamorous,[6] kink,[7] non-binary[8] and bisexual communities. Theoretically their work draws on social constructionism, existentialism and Buddhist philosophy. Barker, with co-author Darren Langdridge, has published two edited collections on sadomasochism[9] and on non-monogamy[10],  and a recent book for mental health professionals (co-authored with Christina Richards). Barker founded the journal of Psychology & Sexuality[11] together with Langdridge in 2010, and they co-edited it until 2017. Barker co-organized the Critical Sexology[12] series from 2006 to 2018, and BiReCon[13] (a biennial research conference which takes place prior to the annual BiCon event).\n\nWriting[edit]\nBarker coined the phrase \u2018anti self-help\u2019 to describe self-help materials which locate the struggles that people have in their wider societal structures and cultural messages rather than in them as individuals[14]. Barker's anti self-help books aim to help people to navigate their relationship with wider sociocultural understandings, rather than viewing themselves as a problem that needs fixing. They have produced books applying this approach to relationships,[15] sex (with Justin Hancock),[16] and gender (with Alex Iantaffi),[17] as well as producing graphic-novel style non-fiction books and zines on queer,[18] mindfulness and other topics,[19] and a podcast on sex and relationships.[20]\n\nConsulting[edit]\nBarker has a background in psychotherapy, and led production on the Open University module Counselling: Exploring Fear and Sadness.[21] They are trained in existential psychotherapy and mindfulness with books on the latter[22] developing the approaches of social mindfulness and mindful sex and relationship therapy (MSRT).[23] Their practice now takes the form of peer-to-peer consulting and mentoring with writers, practitioners, activists, and organizers, with a focus on relationships with self, others, and the wider world.\n\nActivism[edit]\nBarker's activism in the area of LGBT&Q rights has been recognized by placement in the top 40 of The Independent on Sunday newspaper's Pink List,[24] and Rainbow List.[25]  Barker was one of the founder members of BiUK, the organization for bisexual research and activism.[26] This group wrote the international guidelines for academics studying bisexuality (published in Journal of Bisexuality) and produced The Bisexuality Report which informs UK policy and practice regarding bisexuality based on the evidence regarding biphobia, bisexual invisibility, and mental health[27] In 2013, Barker took home an Erotic Award in the academic category for the book Rewriting the Rules, as reported in Times Higher Education.[28] Their current activism focuses on trans and non-binary communities.[29]\n\nWorks[edit]\nBooks (as author)[edit]\nBarker, M.

He entered that establishment in 1888, and got his bachelor's degree in Jurisprudence in 1892. In June 1901 he received the degree of LL.M. from Trinity College, Cambridge.[3] He got his D.C.L. from Oxford in 1901 and his LL.D. from Cambridge in 1903. His expertise was in the field of international law. He taught law at Nottingham, Oxford, London and Liverpool Universities. At that time, he became a prolific writer on international law.\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War, Baty took part in the establishment of the Hugo Grotius Society, established in London in 1915. As one of the original members of that society, Baty got to know Isaburo Yoshida, Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in London and an international law scholar from the graduate school of the Tokyo Imperial University. The Japanese government was searching at that time a foreign legal adviser following the death of Henry Willard Denison, a US citizen who served in that position until his death in 1914. Baty applied for that position in February 1915. The Japanese government accepted his application, and he came to Tokyo in May 1916 to start his work. In 1920, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, third class, for his service as a legal adviser.[4] He renewed his working contracts with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs several times, until in 1928 he became a permanent employee of that ministry. In 1936, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, second class.[5]\nDuring his work for the Japanese government, Baty developed the notion that China was not worthy of recognition as a state under international law, a view that was later used to justify invasion of China.[1]\nIn 1927, he was part of the Japanese delegation to the Geneva Naval Conference on disarmament. This was his only public appearance as legal adviser to the Japanese government, as the rest of his work involved mainly writing legal opinions. In 1932, following the Japanese invasion of north China and the formation of Manchukuo, Baty defended the Japanese position in the League of Nations and called to accept the new state to league membership. He also wrote legal opinions in defense of the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.[6]\nIn July 1941, the Japanese government froze the assets of foreigners residing in Japan or any of its colonial possessions in retaliation for the same move against Japanese assets in the US, but Baty was exempt from this due to his service for the Japanese government. Baty decided to remain in Japan even following the outbreak of war between that country and the British Empire in December 1941. He rejected the efforts by the British Embassy to repatriate him back to his country, and kept working for the Japanese government even during the war. He defended the Japanese policy of conquest as a remedy to western colonialism in Asia. In late 1944, he questioned the legitimacy of the pro-Allied governments established following the end of the German occupation in Belgium and France.\nFollowing the Japanese surrender in 1945, the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs was considering indicting Baty for treason, but the Central Liaison Office (a British government agency operating in Japan) provided an opinion stating that Baty's involvement with the Japanese government during the war was insignificant. In addition, some legal advisers within the British government shielded Baty from possible prosecution on the grounds that he was too old to stand trial. Instead, the British government decided to revoke Baty's British nationality and leave him in Japan. He died in Ichinomiya, Chiba, Japan, on 9 February 1954.\n\nLegal philosophy[edit]\nBaty's legal philosophy evolved as he worked for the Japanese government and was designed to justify Japanese actions of encroaching upon the sovereignty of China. His main argument was that the recognition of states must depend on one factor alone \u2014 effective control by the military and security forces of the government over the state's territory, and not on preconceived definitions of what the state should be. For that reason he opposed the procedure of according de facto recognition, claiming that only final and irrevocable recognition must be used, and accusing the western international community of hypocrisy in using the de facto recognition as a means to allow some transactions with governments of states unfriendly to him without making the definite commitment to accept him fully into the family of nations.[7]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBaty never married. Some evidence suggests that he hated sex, as he was disillusioned with Victorian sexual norms and disgusted by the then accepted notions of male domination over women.[8] He described himself as a radical feminist and a pacifist.[2]\nIn 1916, along with Esther Roper and Eva Gore-Booth, Baty, using the name Irene Clyde, founded Urania, a privately circulated journal which expressed his pioneering views on gender and sexuality, opposing the \"insistent differentiation\" of people into a binary of two genders.[9][10][11] Baty lived out the gender non-conforming principles promoted by Urania, and for this reason is sometimes remembered as non-binary,[12] transgender or as a trans woman when discussed in connection with Urania.[10][11][13] He also wrote under the name Theta.[14]\nAn important person in his life was his sister, who went with him to Japan in 1916, and lived with him until her death in 1944.[citation needed]\nBaty was a strict vegetarian since the age of 19; he was later Vice-President of the British Vegetarian Society.[15]\n\nWorks[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nAs Thomas Baty\nInternational Law in South Africa (1900)\nInternational Law (1909)\n(with John H.

The nimble, vigorous riffs [...] ricocheting like rubber balls around \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To\u201d and \u201cNot My Job\u201d with Blum\u2019s vocals surging in countermelody.[13]\nMax Cohen, in her review for Bandcamp's \"Album of the Day\" series, writes of Pity Boy's production value:\n\n It\u2019s punk in spirit, but the production is rich and warm, wrapping the power chords and solos in a sunny, welcoming fuzz. At their best, as on the jangly opener \u201cThings Still Left to Say,\u201d they sound like The Buzzcocks, if The Buzzcocks opted for compassion instead of bile.[14]\nIn August 2020, Mal Blum was tapped to write music for Season 2 of Netflix's Trinkets television show. They wrote the song \"Passenger Seat\" to be used in a recurring story arc for the character Elodie  [15]\nOn Oct 20, 2020 Blum announced a new single to be released on Saddle Creek Records as part of the label's 7 inch series.[16]\nThey have contributed non-musical written work to Autostraddle,[17] Huffington Post,[18] and The Fader.[19]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBlum is openly transgender and queer.[1] They attended State University of New York at Purchase.[20] They are Jewish. Of their songwriting style, a recent reviewer writes: Although their songs\u2019 subject matters often touch on heavier subjects, Blum\u2019s dry approach to otherwise difficult topics typifies Jewish humor.[4]\nBlum was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age, but has only spoken occasionally about it in interviews [21]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nNobody Waits (2020)\nNobody Waits\nSan Crist\u00f3bal\nPity Boy (2019)\nThings Still Left To Say\nNot My Job\nSee Me\nOdds\nSplinter\nBlack Coffee\nDid You Get What You Wanted\nI Don't Want To\nSalt Flats\nWell, Fuck\nGotta Go\nMaybe I'll Wait\n\n\nYou Look A Lot Like Me (2015)\nArchive\nBetter Go\nRobert Frost\nCool Party\nSplit, Splitting\nReality TV\nIowa\nBetter Than I Was\nNew Orleans\nThe Shrink Thinks\nTempest In A Teacup (2013)\nOverseas Now\nSide I'm On\nAltitude (This Party Sucks)\nThe Bodies, The Zombies!\nCounting My Breaths\nBrooklyn\nWith Samson In Washington State\nThe Difference\nValentine's Day\n\n\nEvery Time You Go Somewhere (2010)\nSan Crist\u00f3bal\nWatercolors\nBaltimore\nNew Year's Eve\nFine!\nWait Forever, Baby\nCircus Heart Pt. 1\nCircus Heart Pt. 2\nI Got Drunk\nWeary\n\n\nGoodnight Sugarpop (2008)\nCut it off\nDysmorphic\nCountry Song\nHypocrite\nMy Name is Earthworm\nWaiting In Line\nThe Suburban Summer Polka\nTumbleweed\nOde to Kulele * video reached number 10 on LOGO's Video of Year for 2009\nYou Should Be Here\nThe Jugular\nI have been listening\n\n[22]\n\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT culture in New York City\nList of self-identified LGBTQ New Yorkers\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Blum is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.[2]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Wolper, Caitlin. \"Mal Blum Explores Self-Destructive Habits On 'Pity Boy'\".

Described as \"the best cabaret artist of their generation\"[2] and a \"tornado of art and activism,\"[3]  Bond first achieved prominence under the pseudonym of Kiki DuRane in the stage duo Kiki and Herb, an act born out of a collaboration with long-time co-star Kenny Mellman.  With a musical voice self-described as \"kind of woody and full with a lot of vibration,\"[4]  Bond is a Tony-nominated (2007) performer who has received GLAAD (2000), Obie (2001), Bessie (2004), Ethyl (2007), and a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists (2012) awards.

Reared in the remote suburbs of Hagerstown, Maryland, Bond's early role models appeared via the stereo and the television set.  From early on, Bond longed \"to sing, be amusing, and wear fabulous outfits\" like Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, and Cher.[7]  The young Bond idolized \"more icy people\" like Joan Didion, Patti Smith, Marianne Faithfull, Vivien Leigh, and Grace Kelly,[8] keeping scrapbooks of Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave.[9] Listening to the family's eight-track tapes in the back seat of a white, Buick Skylark on road trips, Bond preferred a recording of Billy Vaughn and their orchestra because \"it sounded like a movie soundtrack\" for an imaginary film in which Bond, wearing high heels, played the leading role.[10]  Bond recalls falling in love with an album for the first time at the age of four after hearing Wildflowers by Judy Collins,[11] and soon became obsessed with Karen Carpenter.\nThough assigned male at birth, Bond (born Stanley Huffman Bond III but known as Chip) never identified as such. As a child Bond preferred lipstick and Barbies to masculine-coded items and also entered into relationships with boys.[12]  Consequently, Bond grew up feeling \"invisible\", resenting the younger sister who \"got everything I wanted.\"[13] As \"a trans kid in a small town,\" Bond recalls feeling that \"I wasn't being accepted for who I was, but at the time I didn't even have the words to express who I was.\"[14]  Meanwhile, Bond was taking voice lessons and singing in church and in the local community theater, appearing in shows like Brigadoon, Kiss Me, Kate, and The Sound of Music, and channeling comedian Gilda Radner for schoolmates.  Within a personal netherworld of ambiguous gender and sexuality, Bond had begun to construct an identity as a performer.\nBond studied theater at Adelphi University on Long Island from 1981 to 1985.[15] The newly minted freshman saw Simon and Garfunkel in concert in Central Park, but it was visiting Carnegie Hall for the first time to see Judy Collins that invoked the realization that \"I had escaped my hometown and was finally beginning to live the life I'd dreamed of.\"[16] Bond went to London to study theater in the summer of 1984, befriending fellow student Victoria Leacock, daughter of the filmmaker, Richard Leacock. Leacock knew Jenny Lumet, a granddaughter of Lena Horne, and managed to get Bond backstage to meet Horne, who appeared \"icy, intimidating, beautiful and talented \u2013 everything I hoped to be one day.\"[16] Bond later sported a pair of Horne earrings as a souvenir.  Meanwhile, Adelphi advised Bond to become more \"butch\" to earn a living in soap operas.\n\nEarly career[edit]\nAfter graduation, Bond moved into the city to work briefly at Details magazine with Lumet. Returning to Maryland, Bond found roles in regional dinner theaters, often doubling as a server. This work led to a brief stint as assistant to the maitre d' of the Roof Terrace Restaurant in the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where Bond witnessed a memorable performance by Ella Fitzgerald.  Bond took the job partly to find out \"whether or not I could, if I had to, make a living in the 'straight' world\" as a \"normal, middle-class, semi-closeted gay...\"[17] According to Bond, this experiment provided the confidence to \"plunge into my life as a gender non-conforming queer in San Francisco a year later believing that I could \u2013 in case of emergency \u2013 break the glass ceiling by returning to my closeted white male privilege again one day if need be.\"[17] Bond moved to San Francisco in 1988.\nBond remembers this as a period of significant personal growth, both creative and political.  It was here that Bond turned androgyny into a professional asset, developing an identity as a queer performer and activist.  The first steps on this journey led through the Castro District, the vibrant, queer neighborhood mostly concentrated on Castro Street between Market and 19th in San Francisco.  Bond started out broke, clerking in a gay bookstore[9] to buy the coffee at Cafe Flore on Market and Noe, a bohemian salon that became a \"spiritual home.\"[18] Seated at the \"Queen's Table\" in the corner, Bond absorbed a variety of perspectives from all corners of the LGBT community, attending Gay Pride for the first time in 1989.[19]  Participation in Queer Nation and ACT UP, advocacy groups combatting HIV/AIDS, anti-gay violence, and media prejudice, gave Bond \"a voice and a sort of grounding in politics\" that were new.[20]  At some point, Bond adopted the stage name of Justin, later explaining that there were few fates worse than becoming an old, gay man named Chip.[18]\nA turning point occurred when Kate Bornstein cast Bond in her new play, Hidden: A Gender, using the life of the French, intersex person Herculine Barbin as an autobiographical device.  Bond \"was not sure he could really pull off playing a girl,\" according to Bornstein, and feared the censure of \"his gay male friends.\"[21] In fact, the experience unleashed a reservoir of creative energy.  With the assistance of a twenty-something Berkeley drop-out named Kenny Mellman, Bond created the award-nominated lounge act Dixie McCall's Patterns for Living around the persona of actress and singer Julie London.[22] The duo played a number of gigs, both in and out of character; three years after attending Pride for the first time, Bond was hosting the show at the end of the parade.[23] In 1993, Bond hosted the first San Francisco Drag King Contest at the DNA Lounge with Elvis Herselvis.[24] In 1994, Bond appeared on film for the first time, as Amphetamine in John Moritsugu's Mod Fuck Explosion, and again the following year in Fanci's Persuasion.\n\nThe Trans-Atlantic Cabaret Messiah[edit]\nKiki and Herb: 1993\u20132007[edit]\n\nKiki and Herb met in the Eerie Childrens Institute in Western Pennsylvania in 1934. By the time they were in their late teens they were playing professionally on the Burlesque Circuit where Kiki, who had just given birth to her first child \u2013 a bastard named Bradford \u2013 was billed as \"The Completely Insane Miss Kiki DuRane\". In 1957 Kiki and Herb released their first LP \"The Hazy Days of Kiki\" to universal indifference.\n\u2014 Part of the fictional biography for Kiki and Herb.[25]\n\n\nBond is best known for originating the role of washed-up lounge singer Kiki DuRane, \"an alcoholic battle-axe with a throat full of razor-blades.\"[26] Kiki's equally-damaged accompanist Herb, played by pianist Kenny Mellman, made up the other half of the duo, billed as Kiki and Herb.[27] Critics lauded both the performance and the edgy, eclectic repertoire.  Described in one place as \"tragically hip,\"[28] the inspiration arose \"out of my own trauma regarding AIDS and so many people dying,\"[29]  according to Bond.  \"All our friends were dying of AIDS, and it was a way to get out all our rage,\" said Mellman.[21]\nBond moved to New York City in 1994, in the midst of crackdown on queer clubs by then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.  A quote from Bond relates that \"I worked in many bars where the police would just come and shut us down and throw us all out on the street at two or three in the morning.\"[23] Nevertheless, the act continued to evolve, generating a mythical backstory as the entertainers became \"fixtures at downtown New York venues like Flamingo East, P.S. 122, and Fez.\"[30]  Journalist John Russell saw in Kiki \"an icon to rival Hedwig.\"[31]   The New York Times has dubbed Kiki \"the town's most endearingly unhinged chanteuse,\"[32] comparing Bond favorably to more conventional performers for whom \"the point is never the prettiness of the voice.\"[33]  Bond has said that \"I think that the reason people liked Kiki so much is that she had just about everything wrong with her.\"[34]\nKiki and Herb met with more critical acclaim with each successive appearance and developed a cult following.  They received their first New York Times review for Have Another, (1999),[35] a show that earned a GLAAD media award the following year.[36]  They performed extensively, namely in London's Soho Theatre and Queen Elizabeth Hall and New York's The Knitting Factory and Carnegie Hall, as well as a host of other venues worldwide. Their numerous collaborators included Debbie Harry of Blondie, comedian Sandra Bernhard, and Antony of Antony and the Johnsons.  Their recordings included the Christmas album, Do You Hear What We Hear? (2000), and Kiki and Herb Will Die for You: Live at Carnegie Hall (2005).  In 2004, Bond and Mellman did a cameo in the Sony Pictures release Imaginary Heroes, with script by Dan Harris.[37]  Appearing alongside Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, and Emile Hirsch, the duo reprised the Melanie Safka composition Tonight's the Kind of Night from Do You Hear What We Hear?   Their stage act was captured on video in Kiki and Herb Live at the Knitting Factory (2007).  They toured twice in the U.S., including the 2007  'Year of Magical Drinking Tour.'[38]\nThe duo traveled repeatedly to London, where Bond continued to work on an MA in scenography at Central St. Martin's College of Art and Design when not performing.  London shows included Where Are We Now?, Kiki & Herb: There's a Stranger in the Manger, and Kiki & Herb Mount The President, the latter performed aboard HMS\u00a0President in the River Thames.  Bond had a Top 20 Single on the UK alternative chart and was named one of England's fifty funniest people by Time Out London.[39]  The mockumentaries entitled Kiki and Herb on the Rocks (2005) and Kiki and Herb Reloaded (2005) followed the pair to London and around the UK, respectively, featuring the composer Philip Glass, among others.\nTheir show Kiki & Herb: Alive on Broadway ran for five weeks in 2006, and was nominated for a 2007 Tony for Special Theatrical Event.[40] One critic noted that onstage they are \"Alive with a capital A, with all the human vitality and fallibility that that implies.\"[41] A poster on tribe.net reported hearing them mentioned on an episode of Will and Grace early in 2006, noting that \"now they have crossed over.\"[42] Ironically, Bond was by then moving away from the stage act after more than a decade, having almost come to resent the \"very intrusive\" presence of Kiki and the demands associated with playing this \"very dark\" role.  \"I knew that if I kept doing Kiki I wouldn't have the energy to focus on what I really wanted to do,\" Bond explains, \"which was write and perform as myself.\"[31]  \"I created an invulnerable character in Kiki,\" Bond reflected elsewhere, \"and as soon as I got rid of the character, there were a lot of bad habits that sort of fell away. I realized that I have to allow myself to be more vulnerable, more honest, if I'm going to be a performer.\"[43] Locked into a stage act consisting of one other person, it appears that Bond had also begun to feel socially constrained.\nAfter closing on Broadway, Bond took a brief hiatus in London to get away from Kiki, before returning later that year in preparation for the final, American tour.[44] This was followed by a return to Carnegie Hall for a one-night show on December 12, 2007, billed as Kiki and Herb: The Second Coming \u2013 A Christmas Concert.[45]  The show played again at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London.  In spite of their retirement, Kiki and Herb appeared on a list of the top 40 favorite New Yorkers in Time Out New York in 2008.[46] In a 2011 interview with The Guardian, Bond quipped that Kiki DuRane, if not actually deceased, was at least \"in a nursing home in New Jersey.\"[29]\n\nSolo career: 1993\u2013present[edit]\nBond's solo career as a singer, emcee, cabaret artist, and actor, grew up alongside Kiki and Herb, and ultimately outlived them.  Prior to retiring Kiki in 2008, Bond already was touring nationally and abroad, appearing in film, and recording under the name of Justin Bond.  Post-Kiki, Bond continued to move freely between San Francisco and New York, frequently traveling to London and less frequently, to Australia.  The period that followed differed largely in terms of the originality and variety of material as Bond experimented with new endeavors.\nBond's first album came about unexpectedly, as the result of an improvised concert with experimental, electronic sound artist Bob Ostertag and a Japanese turntablist from the Tokyo noise underground, Otomo Yoshihide, at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall in 1997. Bond already appeared on two tracks (\"Not Your Girl\" and \"The Man In The Blue Slip\") on Ostertag's 1995 album, \"Fear No Love\", sharing co-lead vocals duties with Mike Patton. Other guests on the record were Fred Frith and Lynn Breedlove. At the behest of the record label Asphodel, an album was recorded in this location and in studio at Toast, with additional tracks and musicians added later.  Since Otomo spoke little English and could not understand what Bond was saying, he watched the recording engineer through the glass and \"when I see he laugh, I play something funny.\"[47] The album was ultimately released under the Seeland label in 1999 as PantyChrist, with a European, promotional tour.  Although it failed commercially, Ostertag viewed it from an artistic standpoint as \"one of my most successful projects.\"[48]\nThe EP and the two albums that followed likewise appear to have arisen rather spontaneously, differing largely in terms of the original material they contained as a result of Bond's decision to venture into songwriting.  Wanting to get something out quickly and not sure how to do it, Bond released a five track EP Pink Slip in June 2009 featuring four original songs (\"The New Depression,\" \"May Queen,\" \"The Puppet Song,\" \"Michael in Blue\") and a cover of Radiohead's \"Arpeggi/Weird Fishes\".  Pink Slip was recorded at Le Poisson Rouge and Bond hoped income from the EP would help fund the recording of an album.[31] Both of the albums were self-financed, and both were the result of a collaboration with pianist/producer Thomas Bartlett of the band Doveman.[49] The first, Dendrophile (2011), contained a mix of original compositions and covers modeled on a type of \"early-'70s folk-pop variety album\"[49] in the spirit of Judy Collins, featuring a duet with English singer-songwriter Beth Orton.  The title apparently references the creative energy arising from self-acceptance, and is \"all about honoring your nature, and nature itself.\"[50] Bond used Kickstarter to finance the release of a second album, Silver Wells, in 2012.  The album was conceived as an homage to the 1970 Joan Didion novel, Play it as it Lays, which fortified Bond against the isolation that Bond experienced as a child.  The album features covers of songs made famous by Ronee Blakley, Kate Bush, Leonard Cohen, Tracy Chapman, Joni Mitchell, Mark Eitzel, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, among others, and has been described as \"intimate\" and \"confessional\" in tone.[51]  Bond put the songs together as a set list for a show, only later deciding to go into the studio with Bartlett.[50]\nIn 2012, Bond toured nationally with lesbian-feminist, spoken-word collective Sister Spit. promoting the new album.[50] Later that year, Bond opened the new holiday show, Snow Angel, with Amber Martin on vocals, NathAnn Carrera on guitar, and Brett Every on piano.  Depending on the outcome of the presidential election, the name was intended to refer either to \"the whimsical joy of making fun shapes in the snow,\" or \"the imprint you would leave in the snow if you were being raped.\"[52]\nIn June 2006, Bond appeared with David Hoyle in a one-off entitled When David Met Justin at London's Bush Hall.[53] Performing with the House of Whimsy Players at The Kitchen in October, Bond staged Re:Galli Blond (A Sissy Fix), \"a self-penned musical spectacle of transgender oppression and uplift.\"[54] Bond also appeared in Paul Festa's Apparition of the Eternal Church (2006).[55]\nBond has hosted the Weimer New York variety show since its inception in 2007.[56][57] Justin Bond is Close To You reinterpreted Karen Carpenter's album Close To You as part of Joe's Pub in the Park in Central Park in 2007, later moving to Australia's Sydney Opera House.\nIn 2008, the GLAAD-nominated show Lustre premiered at PS122 in the East Village to rave reviews before touring the UK with stops in London and Manchester as part of the It's Queer Up North Arts Festival.  In December 2008, Bond appeared at London's Southbank Centre as Sinderella, in the original musical written by Martyn Jacques of the British cult trio Tiger Lillies.  Bond was credited in the band's album of the same name.[58]  Bond has appeared with Carol Channing, Tilda Swinton, and Chocolate Genius, Inc., among others.\nJustin Bond: Christmas Spells opened in December 2010 at Abrons Arts Center on Grand Street in Manhattan's Lower East Side.  The two-part show included a trademark cabaret performance of holiday tunes, showcasing an original composition, Could Baby Jesus in His Manger Foresee the Hate Sprung From That Night?  This was followed by a theatrical adaptation of a short story by a Bond pal, the artist and gender-theorist Kate Bornstein. Dixie Belle: The Further Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was conceived as a holiday epistle informing Tom Sawyer of the author's gender-bending adventures in a New Orleans bordello after the Civil War.  The letter was read by Bond and enacted by the drag troupe Pixie Harlots. In December 2015 an EP also called Christmas Spells  was released including 3 songs (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Remember (Christmas) and Christmas Spells).[59]\n\n\nAs for Vivian, that's my self-given middle name. Justin is a very male-identified name, and I wanted something that would balance it. I had an uncle named Vivian Francis. He was a wonderful person, but he changed his name to Victor. He didn't like being Vivian. But it's fine with me.\n\u2014 Justin Vivian Bond, 2010.[54]\n\n\nBond starred as Warhol Superstar Jackie Curtis in Jukebox Jackie as part of the 50th anniversary season of La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club between May and June 2012.  \"I've always been really interested in Jackie, Holly Woodlawn, and Candy Darling,\" Bond recounted in an interview at the time, \"because they, along with Renee Richards and Christine Jorgensen, were the first famous trans people. When I was young, they were really the only trans people to which I had been exposed.\"[50] According to Bond, the project originated as a revival of one of Jackie's \"crazy, amphetamine-fueled\" plays, but Bond (and director Scott Wittman) \"couldn't really make sense of them\" and turned to reportage instead. \"I always liked Jackie,\" Bond said, \"because Jackie wasn't willing to say, 'I am a woman trapped in a man's body,' she'd say, 'I'm trans, I'm not a man. I'm not a woman. I'm Jackie.' Which, by the way, was the last line of the show.\"[50]\nBond's new show, Mx America, was slated to open in Australia in February 2013.[60]\nBeginning in January 2014, Bond appeared alongside Stephen Spinella in the Classic Stage Company production of the Bertolt Brecht play, A Man's A Man (Man Equals Man), with new music by Duncan Sheik.  The show ran Off-Broadway at the Company's theater on 13th Street in Manhattan's East Village, with Bond playing the part of Leokadia Begbick, a role originated by Brecht's wife, Helene Weigel.[61] Bond left the show early to go abroad, premiering sold-out shows of Love is Crazy in Paris and New York.  More performances are scheduled for London in February 2015.\nIn December 2014, Bond's wide range and appeal, as well as the personal struggles that have informed all of Bond's work, were once more on display in Star of Light! An Evening of Bi-Polar Witchy Wonder, which opened at Joe's Pub on Lafayette near Manhattan's Astor Place.  One critic found in it \"a surprisingly upbeat holiday show full of sad stories and songs\" both eclectic and smartly executed, noting \"a psychedelic intensity to Bond's voice reminiscent of Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane.\"[62] Backups included Matt Ray on piano, Claudia Chopek on violin, and NathAnn Carrera on guitar.\n\nCollaborators[edit]\nThriving on collaboration, Bond used the platform provided by Kiki and Herb to forge working relationships with a number of rising stars among the downtown demimonde, including filmmaker John Cameron Mitchell, performer Jake Shears, and musician Rufus Wainwright.\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell[edit]\nIn 2006, Bond appeared in the film Shortbus, as part of cast that included Sook-Yin Lee, PJ DeBoy, and Paul Dawson.[29] In the movie, directed by fellow Radical Faerie John Cameron Mitchell, Bond played the mistress of ceremonies at the eponymous avant-garde salon Shortbus, singing the Scott Matthew number, \"In the End,\" to the music of the Hungry March Band.  One journalist commented that this expressed \"in just one scene that heightened sense of simultaneous hope and despair in post\u20139/11 downtown New York City.\"[15] Bond referred to the film as a \"gorgeous little time capsule.\"[63]\nWriting for The New York Times, Frank Bruni noted that Mitchell had relied heavily on friends in casting the film, and that Bond was no exception.  Bond and Mitchell had been frequenting the same Greenwich Village hangouts for about ten years by that time, including the Cow Girl Hall of Fame on Hudson, where Bond had been perfecting the role of Kiki.  Bruni observes that \"on top of all of the other odd aspects of its evolution, \"Shortbus\" represented a reunion and collaboration of fringe artists [like Bond] moving closer to the mainstream.\"[64]  \"Of all the people doing creative things in the queer community,\" wrote Bond's friend and colleague, the experimental sound artist Bob Ostertag, \"Justin Bond had a particular dazzle.\"  Now, Ostertag reflected, \"Justin is a star.\"[65]\n\nJake Shears[edit]\nJake Shears, lead singer of Scissor Sisters, has cited the Kiki and Herb Christmas Show as inspiration. Bond and Shears became friends, with the Scissor Sisters fronting for Kiki and Herb at The Knitting Factory, and with Bond later returning the favor after the band's eponymous debut album went platinum in the United Kingdom in 2004.[15] Bond appeared in the 2017 Music Box Theatre performance of the Tales of the City musical, with score by Shears.[66]\n\nRufus Wainwright[edit]\nThe musician Rufus Wainwright, son of Canadian folk singer Kate McGarrigle, was another rising star from the downtown club scene who befriended Bond at this time.  In 2008, Bond participated in a Christmas show at the Knitting Factory that included Rufus Wainwright, members of Wainwright's family, Grammy Award-winner Emmylou Harris, Lou Reed, Velvet Underground, and performance artist Laurie Anderson.  Revelation Films released the concert DVD in November 2009 under the title A Not So Silent Night (Kate & Anna McGarrigle/Rufus & Martha Wainwright).[67] Bond has appeared in concert with Rufus Wainwright's sister, Martha Wainwright, whom Bond calls a \"Taurean sister.\"  In 2011, Bond stated that \"we are going to celebrate our birthdays together this year.\"[68] In May of that year, Bond appeared with various artists in \"A Celebration of Kate McGarrigle,\" at New York City's Town Hall, to commemorate the passing of the Wainwrights' mother, who had succumbed to cancer the previous year.  A DVD was released in 2013.  In August 2012, Bond officiated at Rufus Wainwright's Long Island wedding.[69]\n\nActivism[edit]\nIdentifying as a queer performer infused Bond's art with an activist ethos from the beginning.  In addition, Bond has labored tirelessly in support of queer causes and organizations and has been numbered \"amongst New York City's most beloved performers . . . remarkable for their generosity of spirit...\"[70] Bond participated in the original Gay Shame event in New York in 1998, performing as Kiki and Herb and recorded in the Scott Berry documentary, Gay Shame '98.  On September 25, 2012, Bond hosted a special edition of Weimar as a fundraiser for the reelection of U.S. President, Barack Obama.  In November, Bond announced a performance to benefit the Ali Forney Center for LGBT youth in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.[71]  Ahead of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Bond appeared in a video by Brooklyn-based Potpourri of Pearls, protesting Russian mistreatment of LGBT persons.[72]\n\nOther projects[edit]\nIn July 2009 Bond made an appearance on the Logo TV comedy series Jeffery & Cole Casserole, playing a Catholic nun who serves as the principal of the show's all-girl Catholic school.[citation needed]\n2011 saw the opening of The Fall of the House of Whimsy exhibition at Participant, Inc., an alternative, Manhattan gallery that hosted an installation of \"artifacts, media, and ephemera\" from Bond's nearby loft (then slated for demolition) including original Bond photographs and watercolors.  The \"spectral\" photographs reflected mostly unoccupied interiors of the loft, while the paintings, portraits and self-portraits, have been described as \"light, aerie images,\" whose subjects fade in and out.[73]  Also on display was a music video of the Bond composition, American Wedding.[74]\nIn 2012, Bond announced the creation of a signature fragrance by Ralf Schwieger, a \"trans-scent\" for all genders called The Afternoon of a Faun after the French poem and modernist ballet of the same name, and issued under the French label Etat libre d'Orange.[75] It was launched in February 2013, at Manhattan's Museum of Arts and Design on Columbus Circle.\nBond received a 2012 Lambda Literary Award for the memoir, Tango: My Childhood Backwards and in High Heels.  Also in 2012, powerHouse Books released Susie Says, a picture book combining Gina Garan photos of the 1970s fashion doll, Susie Sad Eyes, with bon mots from Bond's Twitter account.[76]\nIn the summer of 2014, Bond curated and emceed a cabaret season at the Spiegeltent at the Bard SummerScape Festival in the Hudson Valley, NY.  Bond is set to reprise this emcee role in summer 2015, with guests including Alan Cumming, Suzanne Vega, Martha Wainwright, Stephen Merritt, and Lea Delaria.[77]\nDuring the 2020 pandemic quarantine Bond performed weekly House of Whimsy livestream concerts as Auntie Glam.[78]\nIn July 2020 Bond was announced as part of the cast of Audible's adaptation of Neil Gaiman's The Sandman series, playing the role of Desire of the Endless.[79]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\"In contrast with the furious, blowsy, manic DuRane,\" wrote Maria Bustillos of Out Magazine, \"Bond is gentle, disciplined, observant, and beautifully mannered; a student of the theater, a serious and subtle conversationalist and raconteur.\"[80]\nBond has decided to clarify an identity as a trans-person, explaining that \"for me to claim to be either a man or a woman, feels like a lie. My identity falls somewhere in the middle and is constantly shifting.\"[81] Bond undergoes hormone treatment to appear more feminine,[6] and reported feeling great as a result, noting that \"I like the way my body looks. Emotionally, it's evened me out.\"[29] Eschewing gender reassignment surgery, Bond explained that \"I like my penis, and I am keeping it, but I am creating a transbody\u2014a physical record on my body and a medical record that I am a transgendered person.\"[15] In 2011, Bond also adopted the middle name of 'Vivian', subsequently identifying as \"Justin Vivian Bond\" instead of \"Justin Bond\".[6][54]\nIn concert at the end of 2014, Bond disclosed having received an invitation to return home for Thanksgiving, conditional upon leaving behind \"that fake woman.\"  Acknowledging that \"a lot of trans-kids get kicked out of their homes,\" Bond mused \"I didn't until I was 51.  So I think I'm gonna make it.\"[62] Elsewhere, Bond has said that \"if it wasn't for my family and the rage they engendered in me, I wouldn't be here.\"[21]\n\nRecognition and influence[edit]\nBond was namechecked in the 1999 Le Tigre song \"Hot Topic\".[82]\n\nDiscography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nFormat\n\nNotes\n\n\nFear No Love\n\n1995\n\nAlbum\n\nWith Bob Ostertag, Mike Patton, Fred Frith and Lynn Breedlove\n\n\nPantyChrist\n\n1999\n\nAlbum\n\nWith Bob Ostertag and Otomo Yoshihide\n\n\nDo You Hear What We Hear?\n\n2000\n\nAlbum\n\nWith Kenny Mellman as Kiki and Herb\n\n\nCalling All Kings & Queens\n\n2001\n\nAlbum\n\nVarious artists compilation with Kenny Mellman as Kiki and Herb\n\n\nKiki and Herb Will Die for You: Live at Carnegie Hall\n\n2005\n\nAlbum\n\nWith Kenny Mellman as Kiki and Herb\n\n\nBroadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols For A Cure Volume 8\n\n2006\n\nAlbum\n\nVarious artists compilation with Kenny Mellman as Kiki and Herb\n\n\nShortbus\n\n2006\n\nSoundtrack\n\nWith The Hungry March Band\n\n\nHow Do You Dance To Techno?\n\n2008\n\nSingle\n\nPlush label, France.\n\n\nPink Slip\n\n2009\n\nEP\n\n\n\n\nSinderella\n\n2009\n\nAlbum\n\nWith The Tiger Lillies\n\n\nDendrophile\n\n2011\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\n\nSilver Wells\n\n2012\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\n\nSing Me the Songs: Celebrating the Works of Kate McGarrigle\n\n2013\n\nAlbum\n\nVarious artists live recordings\n\n\nChristmas Spells\n\n2015\n\nEP\n\n\n\n\nWhitey on the Moon\n\n2020\n\nEP\n\nLive performances previously recorded with Kenny Mellman as Kiki and Herb; title track based on the 1970 poem by Gil Scott-Heron\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nDirector\n\n\n1994\n\nMod Fuck Explosion\n\nAmphetamine\n\nJon Moritsugu\n\n\n1995\n\nFanci's Persuasion\n\nIrene Wiesenthal\n\nCharles Herman-Wurmfeld\n\n\n1998\n\nGay Shame '98\n\nKiki\n\nScott Berry\n\n\n1998\n\nDowntown Darlings\n\nJustin Bond\n\nDaniel Falcone\n\n\n2004\n\nImaginary Heroes\n\nKiki\n\nDan Harris\n\n\n2005\n\nKiki and Herb on the Rocks\n\nKiki\n\nMike Nicholls\n\n\n2005\n\nKiki and Herb Reloaded\n\nKiki\n\nMichaline Babich, Chris Gallagher, Matt Gallagher\n\n\n2006\n\nThe Banana Monologue\n\nJustin Bond\n\nIan Rodney Wooldridge\n\n\n2006\n\nShortbus\n\nJustin Bond\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell\n\n\n2006\n\nApparition of the Eternal Church\n\nKiki\n\nPaul Festa\n\n\n2007\n\nKiki & Herb Live at the Knitting Factory\n\nKiki\n\nGerard Schmidt\n\n\n2007\n\nGifted and Challenged: The Making of Shortbus\n\nJustin Bond\n\nM.

In 1986, Bornstein identified as gender non-conforming and has stated \"I don't call myself a woman, and I know I'm not a man\" after having been assigned male at birth and receiving sex reassignment surgery.[3]\nThey now identify with the pronouns they/them or she/her.[4] Bornstein has also written about having anorexia, being a survivor of PTSD and being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life\n1.2 Transition and post-op\n1.3 Cancer diagnosis\n\n\n2 Works\n\n2.1 Books\n2.2 Performance pieces\n\n\n3 References\n4 Further reading\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nEarly life[edit]\nBorn in Neptune City, New Jersey, into an upper middle-class Conservative Jewish family of Russian and Dutch descent,[6] Bornstein studied Theater Arts with John Emigh and Jim Barnhill at Brown University (Class of '69). She joined the Church of Scientology, becoming a high-ranking lieutenant in the Sea Org,[7][8][9] but later became disillusioned and formally left the movement in 1981. Bornstein's antagonism toward Scientology and public split from the church have had personal consequences; Bornstein's daughter, herself a Scientologist, no longer has any contact per Scientology's policy of disconnection.[10]\n\nTransition and post-op[edit]\nBornstein never felt comfortable with the belief of the day that all trans women are \"women trapped in men's bodies.\"[11] She did not identify as a man, but the only other option was to be a woman, a reflection of the gender binary, which required people to identify according to only two available genders. Another obstacle was the fact that Bornstein was attracted to women. She had sex reassignment surgery in 1986.\nBornstein settled into the lesbian community in San Francisco, and wrote art reviews for the gay and lesbian paper The Bay Area Reporter.[12] Over the next few years, she began to identify as neither a man nor a woman.[13] This catapulted Bornstein back to performing, creating several performance pieces, some of them one-person shows. It was the only way that she knew how to communicate life's paradoxes.\nBornstein also teaches workshops and has published several gender theory books and a novel. Hello Cruel World was written to keep \"teens, freaks, and other outlaws\" from dying by suicide. \"Do whatever it takes to make your life more worth living,\" Bornstein writes, \"just don't be mean.\"[14]\n\n Kate Bornstein at SUNY New Paltz in October, 2018. Photo by Morgan Gwenwald.\nBornstein's partner is Barbara Carrellas. They live in New York City with three cats, two dogs, and a turtle.[15]\n\nCancer diagnosis[edit]\nIn August 2012, Bornstein was diagnosed with lung cancer. Doctors thought that she was cancer-free after surgery, but it emerged in February 2013 that the disease had returned. Laura Vogel, a friend of hers, launched a GoFundMe campaign on March 20 to help fund the cancer treatment.[16]\n\nWorks[edit]\nIn 1989, Bornstein created a theatre production in collaboration with Noreen Barnes, Hidden: A Gender,  based on parallels between her own life and that of the intersex person Herculine Barbin.[17] In 2009, Bornstein's Hello, Cruel World: 101 Alternatives to Suicide for Teens, Freaks, and Other Outlaws was a Lambda Literary Award Finalist for LGBT Nonfiction and Honorbook for the Stonewall Children's and Young Adult Literature.[18] Bornstein edited Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation in collaboration with S. Bear Bergman.[19] The anthology won Lambda Literary and Publishing Triangle Awards in 2011.[20][21] Bornstein's autobiography, titled A Queer and Pleasant Danger: A Memoir, was released May 2012, and in April 2013, she released My New Gender Workbook: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving World Peace Through Gender Anarchy and Sex Positivity. Recently, Bornstein has taken part in a theatrical tour in England. She also took part in being a cast member in the reality TV show of I am Cait.[22]\n\nBooks[edit]\nBornstein, Kate (1994).

For her first show at the gay bar Infinity in Rochester, Steck chose her drag name as a play on words of Pandora's box, an artifact found in Greek mythology.[4]\n\nCareer[edit]\n Pandora Boxx at RuPaul's DragCon LA 2018\nBoxx auditioned two times before becoming a contestant on the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Highlights of her performance on Drag Race include an impersonation of Carol Channing on \"Snatch Game\" (a Match Game parody challenge). Performing well in the show's challenges, her failure to win one resulted in RuPaul calling her \"the Susan Lucci of this competition.\" She was eliminated in the eighth episode, \"Golden Gals.\"[5] After her elimination, Entertainment Weekly called her their pick for \"America's Next Drag Superstar.\"[6][7] She was later voted the Miss Congeniality of her season.\nAfter her elimination, Boxx appeared on the three seasons of the Drag Race spin-off series RuPaul's Drag U. She also appeared in a television commercial for Absolut Vodka that aired during the third season of Drag Race dressed as a Bloody Mary.[8]\nIn 2011, she hosted an episode of Logo's One Night Stand Up, a comedy special filmed live in the Bowery Ballroom in New York City. Other performers included Bianca Del Rio, Hedda Lettuce, and Kelly Mantle.[9] Later that year, Boxx appeared in an Entertainment Weekly photo spread along with Mimi Imfurst that featured Melissa McCarthy channeling Divine.[10] On September 27, 2011, Boxx released her first single \"Cooter!\"\nBoxx and Sherry Vine released \"Give Me All Your Muff\", a parody of \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" by Madonna in 2012.[11] In addition, Boxx released several singles in 2012: a cover version of Samantha Fox's hit song \"I Wanna Have Some Fun\" and the original song \"Nice Car! (Shame About Your Penis).\"\n\n Pandora Boxx (8-13-14) (14763882618) (cropped)\nIn 2012, Sharon Needles won the online voting to appear on RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, but revealed that she was not going to participate due to the fact she was the reigning winner of the fourth season. Needles also confirmed that Boxx was her replacement and would appear on the show.[12] Boxx, along with team partner Mimi Imfurst, formed Team Mandora, were the first two contestants eliminated on All Stars.\nAfter All Stars 1, Boxx was a playable character with Manila Luzon and Yara Sofia for the \"RuPaul's Drag Race: Dragopolis\" mobile app.[13]\nIn 2013, Boxx began hosting Drag Race recaps for NewNowNext on Logo, called \"Drag Center\". She also released a single with Adam Barta called \"You Seemed Shady to Me\", which hit Top 50 on the iTunes comedy single charts.[14]\nIn 2018, Boxx released \"Oops I Think I Pooped\", a parody of \"This Is How We Do\" by Katy Perry.

They are also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School.[5]\nButler is best known for their books Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990) and Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex (1993), in which they challenge conventional notions of gender and develop their theory of gender performativity. This theory has had a major influence on feminist and queer scholarship.[6] Their works are often studied in film studies courses emphasizing gender studies and performativity in discourse.\nButler has supported lesbian and gay rights movements and has spoken out on many contemporary political issues.[7] In particular, they are a vocal critic of Zionism, Israeli politics,[8] and its effect on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, emphasizing that Israel does not and should not be taken to represent all Jews or Jewish opinion.[9]\nButler uses singular they pronouns and she pronouns.[10][11]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Overview of major works\n\n2.1 Performative Acts and Gender Constitution (1988)\n2.2 Gender Trouble (1990)\n2.3 Imitation and Gender Insubordination (1990)\n2.4 Bodies That Matter (1993)\n2.5 Excitable Speech (1997)\n2.6 Undoing Gender (2004)\n2.7 Giving an Account of Oneself (2005)\n\n\n3 Reception\n4 Criticism\n5 Political activism\n\n5.1 Adorno Prize affair\n5.2 Comments on Hamas and Hezbollah\n5.3 Comments on Black Lives Matter\n5.4 Avital Ronell sexual harassment case\n\n\n6 Personal life\n7 Selected honors and awards\n8 Publications\n\n8.1 Books\n8.2 Book chapters\n\n\n9 See also\n10 References\n11 Further reading\n12 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nJudith Butler was born on February 24, 1956, in Cleveland, Ohio,[2] to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent.[12] Most of their maternal grandmother's family perished in the Holocaust.[13] Butler's parents were practising Reform Jews. Their mother was raised Orthodox, eventually becoming Conservative and then Reform, while their father was raised Reform. As a child and teenager, Butler attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where they received their \"first training in philosophy\". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with Haaretz that they began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by Butler's Hebrew school's Rabbi because they were \"too talkative in class\".[13]  Butler also stated that they were \"thrilled\" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what they wanted to study in these special sessions, they responded with three questions preoccupying them at the time: \"Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?\"[14]\nButler attended Bennington College before transferring to Yale University, where they studied philosophy, receiving their Bachelor of Arts degree in 1978 and their Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1984.[15] They spent one academic year at Heidelberg University as a Fulbright Scholar.[16] Butler taught at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, and Johns Hopkins University before joining University of California, Berkeley, in 1993.[17] In 2002 they held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam.[18] In addition, they joined the department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University as Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Visiting Professor of the Humanities in the spring semesters of 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the option of remaining as full-time faculty.[19][20][21][22]\nButler serves on the editorial board or advisory board of several academic journals, including JAC: A Journal of Rhetoric, Culture, and Politics and Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society.[23][24]\n\nOverview of major works[edit]\nPerformative Acts and Gender Constitution (1988)[edit]\nIn the essay \"Performative Acts and Gender Constitution\", Judith Butler proposes that gender is performative. They draw on the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the feminism of Simone de Beauvoir, noting that both thinkers ground their theories in \"lived experience\" and view the sexual body as a historical idea or situation.[25] Butler distinguishes \"between sex, as biological facticity, and gender, as the cultural interpretation or signification of that facticity.\"[25]\nButler argues that gender is best perceived as performative, which suggests that it has a social audience. It also suggests that performances of woman are compelled and enforced by historical social practice.\nFor Butler, the \"script\" of gender performance is effortlessly transmitted generation to generation in the form of socially established \"meanings\": They state, \"gender is not a radical choice\u00a0... [nor is it] imposed or inscribed upon the individual\".[25] Given the social nature of human beings, most actions are witnessed, reproduced, and internalized and thus take on a performative or theatric quality. According to Butler's theory, gender is essentially a performative repetition of acts associated with male or female. Currently, the actions appropriate for men and women have been transmitted to produce a social atmosphere that both maintains and legitimizes a seemingly natural gender binary.[25] Consistently with Butler's acceptance of the body as a historical idea, they suggest that our concept of gender is seen as natural or innate because the body \"becomes its gender through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through time\".[25]\nButler argues that the performance of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, they compare the performativity of gender to the performance of the theater. They bring many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However, Butler also brings to light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. They explain how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.\nButler uses Sigmund Freud's notion of how a person's identity is modeled in terms of the normal. Butler revises Freud's notion of this concept's applicability to lesbianism, where Freud says that lesbians are modeling their behavior on men, the perceived normal or ideal. Butler instead says that all gender works in this way of performativity and a representation of an internalized notion of gender norms.[26]\n\nGender Trouble (1990)[edit]\nMain article: Gender Trouble\nGender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity was first published in 1990, selling over 100,000 copies internationally, in multiple languages.[27] The book's title alludes to the 1974 John Waters film Female Trouble, which stars the drag queen Divine.[28] Gender Trouble discusses the works of Sigmund Freud, Simone de Beauvoir, Julia Kristeva, Jacques Lacan, Luce Irigaray, Monique Wittig, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The book has even inspired an intellectual fanzine, Judy![29]\nThe crux of Butler's argument in Gender Trouble is that the coherence of the categories of sex, gender, and sexuality\u2014the natural-seeming coherence, for example, of masculine gender and heterosexual desire in male bodies\u2014is culturally constructed through the repetition of stylized acts in time. Although the repeated, stylized bodily acts establish the appearance of an essential, ontological \"core\" gender, Butler understands gender, along with sex and sexuality, to be performative. Butler explicitly challenges biological accounts of binary sex.[30] The performance of gender is not voluntary, in Butler's opinion, and they believe the gendered, sexed, desiring subject must be constructed within what they call, borrowing from Foucault's Discipline and Punish, \"regulative discourses.\" These, also called \"frameworks of intelligibility\" or \"disciplinary regimes,\" determine in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as coherent or \"natural\".[citation needed] Regulative discourse includes disciplinary techniques that coerce the stylized actions and thereby maintain the appearance of \"core\" gender, sex and sexuality.[31]\nThe supposed obviousness of sex as a natural fact attests to how deeply its production in discourse is concealed. The sexed body, once established as a natural fact, is the alibi for constructions of gender and sexuality, which then purport to be the just-as-natural expressions or consequences of sex. In Butler's account, it is on the basis of the construction of natural binary sex that binary gender and heterosexuality are likewise constructed as natural.[32] Butler claims that without a critique of sex as produced by discourse, the sex/gender distinction as a feminist strategy for contesting constructions of binary asymmetric gender and compulsory heterosexuality will be ineffective.[33]\nButler offers a critique of the terms gender and sex as they have been used by feminists.[34] Butler argues that feminism made a mistake in trying to make \"women\" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler writes that this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations.  Butler believes that feminists should not try to define \"women\" and they also believe that feminists should \"focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement.\"[35] Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be \"flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors\". The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as a performance, not an essence, is one of the foundations of queer theory.\n\nImitation and Gender Insubordination (1990)[edit]\nJudith Butler explores the production of identities such as homosexual and heterosexual and the limiting nature of identity categories. An identity category for them is a result of certain exclusions and concealments, and thus a site of regulation. Butler acknowledges, however, that categorized identities are important for political action at the present time. Butler believes that identity forms through repetition or imitation and is not original. Imitation fosters the illusion of continuity. Heterosexual identity, which is set up as an ideal, requires constant, compulsive repetition if it is to be safeguarded.[36]\n\nBodies That Matter (1993)[edit]\nBodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\" seeks to clear up readings and supposed misreadings of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice.[37] Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of Derrida's theory of iterability, which is a form of citationality:\n\nPerformativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed by a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance.[38]\nExcitable Speech (1997)[edit]\nFurther information: Performativity \u00a7\u00a0Judith Butler\nIn Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative, Butler surveys the problems of hate speech and censorship. They argue that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.[39]\nButler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon's argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor.[40]\nDeploying Foucault's argument from the first volume of The History of Sexuality, Butler claims that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid.[41] As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th-century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control.[42] Extending this argument using Derrida and Lacan, Butler claims that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic \"I\" is a mere effect of an originary censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; \"If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech\".[43]\n\nUndoing Gender (2004)[edit]\nUndoing Gender collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of their other books. Butler revisits and refines their notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing \"restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life\".\nButler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is \"automatic or mechanical\". They argue that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of \"human\" and \"less-than-human\" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a \"viable life\" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if his or her desires differ from normality. Butler states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life \"unlivable\". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.[44]\nIn Butler's discussion of intersex issues and people, Butler addresses the case of David Reimer, a person whose sex was medically \"reassigned\" from male to female after a botched circumcision at eight months of age. Reimer was \"made\" female by doctors, but later in life identified as \"really\" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl, which he wrote with John Colapinto.  Reimer died by suicide in 2004.[45]\n\nGiving an Account of Oneself (2005)[edit]\nIn Giving an Account of Oneself, Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from Theodor Adorno, Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean Laplanche, Adriana Cavarero and Emmanuel Levinas, Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. Butler theorizes the subject in relation to the social\u00a0\u2013 a community of others and their norms \u2013 which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical \"I\", in the first place.\nButler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.\n\nYou may think that I am in fact telling a story about the prehistory of the subject, one that I have been arguing cannot be told. There are two responses to this objection. (1) That there is no final or adequate narrative reconstruction of the prehistory of the speaking \"I\" does not mean we cannot narrate it; it only means that at the moment when we narrate we become speculative philosophers or fiction writers. (2) This prehistory has never stopped happening and, as such, is not a prehistory in any chronological sense. It is not done with, over, relegated to a past, which then becomes part of a causal or narrative reconstruction of the self. On the contrary, that prehistory interrupts the story I have to give of myself, makes every account of myself partial and failed, and constitutes, in a way, my failure to be fully accountable for my actions, my final \"irresponsibility,\" one for which I may be forgiven only because I could not do otherwise. This not being able to do otherwise is our common predicament (page 78).\nInstead Butler argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.[46][47]\n\nReception[edit]\n Butler receives the Theodor W. Adorno Award in 2012\nButler's work has been influential in feminist and queer theory, cultural studies, and continental philosophy.[48] Yet their contribution to a range of other disciplines\u2014such as psychoanalysis, literary, film, and performance studies as well as visual arts\u2014has also been significant.[4] Their theory of gender performativity as well as their conception of \"critically queer\" have not only transformed understandings of gender and queer identity in the academic world, but have shaped and mobilized various kinds of political activism, particularly queer activism, across the globe.[48][49][50][51] Butler's work has also entered into contemporary debates on the teaching of gender, gay parenting, and the depathologization of transgender people.[52] Before election to the papacy, Pope Benedict XVI wrote several pages challenging Butler's arguments on gender.[53] In several countries, Butler became the symbol of the destruction of traditional gender roles for reactionary movements.[citation needed] This was particularly the case in France during the anti-gay marriage protests.[citation needed] Bruno Perreau has written that Butler was literally depicted as an \"antichrist\", both because of their gender and their Jewish identity, the fear of minority politics and critical studies being expressed through fantasies of a corrupted body.[54]\nSome academics and political activists maintain that Butler's radical departure from the sex/gender dichotomy and Butler's non-essentialist conception of gender\u2014along with their insistence that power helps form the subject\u2014revolutionized feminist and queer praxis, thought, and studies.[55] Darin Barney of McGill University wrote that:\n\nButler's work on gender, sex, sexuality, queerness, feminism, bodies, political speech and ethics has changed the way scholars all over the world think, talk and write about identity, subjectivity, power and politics. It has also changed the lives of countless people whose bodies, genders, sexualities and desires have made them subject to violence, exclusion and oppression.[56]\nCriticism[edit]\nOther scholars have been more critical. In 1998, Denis Dutton's journal Philosophy and Literature awarded Butler first prize in its fourth annual \"Bad Writing Competition\", which set out to \"celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles.\"[57] Butler's unwitting entry, which ran in a 1997 issue of the scholarly journal Diacritics, ran thus:\n\nThe move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.[57]\nSome critics have accused Butler of elitism due to their difficult prose style, while others claim that Butler reduces gender to \"discourse\" or promotes a form of gender voluntarism. Susan Bordo, for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language and has contended that the body is a major part of gender, in opposition to Butler's conception of gender as performative.[58] A particularly vocal critic has been feminist Martha Nussbaum, who has argued that Butler misreads J.\u00a0L. Austin's idea of performative utterance, makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no \"normative theory of social justice and human dignity.\"[59][60] Finally, Nancy Fraser's critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists.  Fraser has suggested that Butler's focus on performativity distances them from \"everyday ways of talking and thinking about ourselves.\u00a0... Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?\"[61]\nButler responded to criticisms of their prose in the preface to the 1999 edition of their book, Gender Trouble.[62]\nMore recently, several critics\u2014most prominently, Viviane Namaste[63]\n\u2014have criticised Judith Butler's Undoing Gender for under-emphasizing the intersectional aspects of gender-based violence. For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like \"gender politics\" and \"gender violence\" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the United States can \"[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialised urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work\", and produce instead \"a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out\".[64]\nGerman feminist Alice Schwarzer speaks of Butler's \"radical intellectual games\" that would not change how society classifies and treats a woman; thus, by eliminating female and male identity Butler would have abolished the discourse about sexism in the queer community. Schwarzer also accuses Butler of remaining silent about the oppression of women and homosexuals in the Islamic world, while readily exercising their right to same-sex-marriage in the United States; instead, Butler would sweepingly defend Islam, including Islamism, from critics.[65]\n\nPolitical activism[edit]\nMuch of Butler's early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and they served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.[66]  Over the years, Butler has been particularly active in the gay and lesbian rights, feminist, and anti-war movements.[7] They have also written and spoken out on issues ranging from affirmative action and gay marriage to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay.  More recently, Butler has been active in the Occupy movement and has publicly expressed support for a version of the 2005 BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) campaign against Israel.\nOn September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized teach-in against the 2006 Lebanon War at the University of California, Berkeley.[67] Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony. They cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, Butler went on to name several groups that they commended as stronger opponents of \"homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism\".[68]\nIn October 2011, Butler attended Occupy Wall Street and, in reference to calls for clarification of the protesters' demands, they said:\n\nPeople have asked, so what are the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible\u00a0\u2013 that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.[69]\n\n Achille Mbembe, Wendy Brown, Judith Butler, and David Theo-Goldberg in 2016\nButler is currently an executive member of FFIPP - Educational Network for Human Rights in Israel/Palestine.[70] They are also a member of the advisory board of Jewish Voice for Peace.[70] In mainstream US politics, they expressed support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.[71]\n\nAdorno Prize affair[edit]\nWhen Butler received the 2012 Adorno Prize, the prize committee came under attack from Israel's Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman; the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center office in Jerusalem, Efraim Zuroff;[72] and the German Central Council of Jews. They were upset at Butler's selection because of Butler's remarks about Israel and specifically their \"calls for a boycott against Israel\".[73] Butler responded saying that \"[Butler] did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally\".[74] Rather, they wrote, the attacks are \"directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies\".[74]\nIn a letter to the Mondoweiss website, Butler asserted that they developed strong ethical views on the basis of Jewish philosophical thought and that it is \"blatantly untrue, absurd, and painful for anyone to argue that those who formulate a criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic or, if Jewish, self-hating\".[70]\n\nComments on Hamas and Hezbollah[edit]\nButler was criticized for statements they had made about Hamas and Hezbollah. Butler was accused of describing them as \"social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left\".[75] They were accused of defending \"Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations\" and supporting their tactics.[76][77]\nButler responded to these criticisms by stating that their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and, in so doing, their established views on non-violence were contradicted and misrepresented.\nButler describes the origin of their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way:\n\nI was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to \"the global left\" and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.[70]\nComments on Black Lives Matter[edit]\nIn a January 2015 interview with George Yancy of The New York Times, Butler discussed the Black Lives Matter movement. They said:\n\nWhat is implied by this statement [Black Lives Matter], a statement that should be obviously true, but apparently is not? If black lives do not matter, then they are not really regarded as lives, since a life is supposed to matter. So what we see is that some lives matter more than others, that some lives matter so much that they need to be protected at all costs, and that other lives matter less, or not at all. And when that becomes the situation, then the lives that do not matter so much, or do not matter at all, can be killed or lost, can be exposed to conditions of destitution, and there is no concern, or even worse, that is regarded as the way it is supposed to be...When people engage in concerted actions across racial lines to build communities based on equality, to defend the rights of those who are disproportionately imperiled to have a chance to live without the fear of dying quite suddenly at the hands of the police. There are many ways to do this, in the street, the office, the home, and in the media. Only through such an ever-growing cross-racial struggle against racism can we begin to achieve a sense of all the lives that really do matter.\nThe dialogue draws heavily on their 2004 book Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence.[78]\n\nAvital Ronell sexual harassment case[edit]\nOn May 11, 2018, Butler led a group of scholars in writing a letter to New York University following the sexual harassment suit filed by a former NYU graduate student against his advisor Avital Ronell. The signatories acknowledged not having had access to the confidential findings of the investigation that followed the Title IX complaint against Ronell. Nonetheless, they accused the complainant of waging a \"malicious campaign\" against Ronell. The signatories also wrote that the presumed \"malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare\" for a highly regarded scholar. \"If she were to be terminated or relieved of her duties, the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed.\"[79] Butler, the chief signatory, invoked their title as President Elect of the Modern Language Association. James J. Marino, a professor at Cleveland State University and a member of the MLA, started a petition to demand Butler's resignation or removal from their post. He argued that \"Protesting against one instance of punishment is only a means to the larger end of preserving senior faculty's privilege of impunity.\u00a0... [Butler] was standing up for an old, corrupt, and long-standing way of doing business. The time for doing business that way is over. We should never look back.\"[80] Some three months later, Butler apologized to the MLA for the letter. \"I acknowledged that I should not have allowed the MLA affiliation to go forward with my name,\" Butler wrote to the Chronicle of Higher Education. \"I expressed regret to the MLA officers and staff, and my colleagues accepted my apology.

In June 2019, a panel of judges from New York magazine placed Chachki 16th on their list of \"the most powerful drag queens in America\", a ranking of 100 former Drag Race contestants.[4]  They have indicated they prefer to use they/them in pronouns in and out of drag as well as she/her in drag.[5][citation needed]\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Music\n3 Artistry\n4 Personal life\n5 Discography\n\n5.1 EPs\n5.2 Singles\n5.3 Other appearances\n\n\n6 Filmography\n\n6.1 Film\n6.2 Television\n6.3 Web series\n6.4 Music videos\n\n\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\n Violet Chachki on stage in Copenhagen\nDardo began performing in drag as Violet Chachki at the age of 19. The name \"Violet\" was inspired by Jennifer Tilly's character in the film Bound, while \"Chachki\" is a variant of the Yiddish word tchotchke, a small object that is decorative rather than functional.[6] Violet first performed at the bar LeBuzz in Marietta, Georgia. They used a fake ID to perform in local drag shows, eventually winning Miss New Faces at Friends on Ponce in Atlanta. Later, the drag queen and Drag Race Season 8 contestant Dax ExclamationPoint adopted Dardo as his \"drag daughter\". Dardo was enrolled at the Savannah College of Art and Design at the Atlanta campus for fashion design, but dropped out to focus on drag. They became a regular cast member of The Other Show at the bar Jungle in Atlanta which gave them exposure locally and allowed them to perform with Drag Race Season 5 contestant Alaska Thunderfuck 5000, Amanda Lepore, and Lady Bunny.[7]\nIn 2013, Violet was photographed for \"Legendary Children\". The project focused on Atlanta's drag scene and was exhibited at Gallery 1526. Two photos that featured their penis and gaff (an undergarment used to conceal male genitals when in drag) were covered up after complaints. Later, the censorship controversy caught the attention of Vice.[8][9]\nIn 2014, Violet appeared on the cover for the single \"Cosplay\" by Captain Murphy (AKA Flying Lotus). They also appeared in a commercial for the single on Adult Swim.[10] Flying Lotus recorded the song as Captain Murphy for Adult Swim's Single Series.[11]\nViolet was a contestant on seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race,[12] after having unsuccessfully auditioned for season six.[13] On the show, Violet was noted for excelling in fashion and design related challenges and their focus on aesthetics and confident demeanor.[14] On June 1, 2015 Violet won the competition and received a cash prize of $100,000.[15]\nViolet Chachki is known for their burlesque performances and aerial work, including aerial silk and aerial hoop.[16] In January 2017, Dardo joined The Art of Teese, a neo-burlesque show headlined by Dita Von Teese.[17]\nIn November 2017, Dardo became the first drag queen in a major lingerie ad campaign, for Bettie Page Lingerie.[18]\nIn January 2018, Dardo walked for Moschino in their Fall 2018 Collection at Milan Fashion Week.[19]\nIn May 2019, Violet attended the Met Gala, where the theme was Camp: Notes on Fashion, wearing a glove-shaped Moschino dress which was altered by Jeremy Scott.[20]\n\nMusic[edit]\nOn June 2, 2015, Dardo released the lead single from their upcoming EP, \"Bettie\".[21] Their debut EP Gagged was released on June 30, 2015.[22] In May 2018 Dardo released their fourth single, \"A Lot More Me\", a burlesque track independent from an album.[23]\n\nArtistry[edit]\nViolet Chachki's style is characterized by their \"obsession with vintage glamour\".[24] They have been referred to as \"the living embodiment of a 1950s female archetype\" and has cited designers Christian Dior, Thierry Mugler and John Galliano as inspirations, as well as \"style icons\" such as Lady Miss Kier, Dovima, Dita Von Teese and Raquel Welch.[25]\nThe influence of fetish fashion and art is a staple in Chachki's aesthetic, with references to the bondage and latex subcultures,[25] John Willie's illustrations,[26] dominatrix imagery[27] and Bettie Page.[28] They told Design Scene in 2016: \"I think drag in itself is kind of a fetish, it\u2019s kind of uncomfortable and I think bondage and latex are uncomfortable and they have that same feel... I think especially when you\u2019re really feeling it and feeling your look and you\u2019re willing to suffer through the pain to kind of present yourself the way you want to present...

In a series first, all four queens ended up advancing to the finale.[23] In the season finale, Coule\u00e9 received a personalized video from Blac Chyna, whom Coule\u00e9 had portrayed earlier in the \"Reality Stars: The Rusical\" challenge.[24] In this finale, for the first time in Drag Race history, the final four queens all participated in a \"lip sync for the crown\". Coulee was selected to lipsync against Sasha Velour, to Whitney Houston's \"So Emotional\", but lost. They ultimately placed in joint third/fourth place.[25][26] Coule\u00e9's loss was met with controversy, with many people claiming that Shea Coule\u00e9 should have won the crown.[27] Coulee themself responded to the controversy, defending Velour's win, and saying \"Ultimately Sasha was more successful than myself and the other girls.\"[28] While on tour, Merrell and fellow Drag Race contestant Farrah Moan were harassed by a woman at a kebab shop in Newcastle in April 2018 who first yelled at and then tried to hit the off-duty queens.[29] Since losing Season 9, Coule\u00e9 has been requested by fans to compete on an All Star season.[30][31][32][33]\nOn the 8th May 2020, Coul\u00e9e was announced as a contestant on the fifth series of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars.[6]\nShe won the second episode, lipsyncing for her legacy against Lipsync Assassin Alyssa Edwards to The Pointer Sisters' Neutron Dance and winning, earning a $20,000 cash prize.[34] Coule\u00e9 won again during the Snatch Game of Love challenge on episode five, portraying Flavor Flav.

The following month, they released a music video for the song, directed by Sam Bailey. The song is about Shea Coule\u00e9's former boyfriend who suffered from bipolar disorder and committed suicide.[66][67]\nCoule\u00e9 was one of the Inspirations for Sina Grace's character of Shade, Marvel's first Drag Queen superhero.[68][69] Coule\u00e9 has embarked on several world tours following their success on Drag Race including headlining the \"War on the Catwalk\"[70] and \"A Drag Queen Christmas\",[71] among others. Coulee was added to the Drag Race \"Haters Roast: The Shady Tour\" comedy tour with other Drag Race alumnae in 2019.[72] They also headlined a one-woman show in 2019, entitled \"Coulee With A 'C'\". An autobiographical show, it combined song, story, and comedy, revolving around their upbringing and how they got into drag.[73] Coule\u00e9's makeup and look transformations have been featured in publications such as Cosmopolitan.[74]\nIn October, Coulee published their first article for Metro.[75] In January 2020, Coule\u00e9 attended the first ever RuPaul's DragCon UK.[76] In March 2020, Coule\u00e9 will be performing alongside fellow drag race alum Bebe Zahara Benet, Bob The Drag Queen, Monique Heart, Peppermint, and The Vixen in Nubia tour. The tour began its run with sold-out shows in New York City, and has plans to visit Los Angeles, as well as other major cities across the United States.[77][78] In October 2020, Coule\u00e9 was featured on the cover of Out magazine, recreating Cindy Crawford and k.d. Lang's iconic Vanity Fair cover.[79] Later that month, they were a featured performer in Rihanna's Savage X Fenty  Fashion Show Vol. 2.[80]\nIn an interview with The Advocate, Coule\u00e9 announced that for the past three years, they have been working on an album.[81]\n\nActivism[edit]\n\nQueens of color are less celebrated than our white counterparts. But that's life, we have to work twice as hard to get half the recognition.\n\u2013Coule\u00e9, in an interview with Billboard[82]\n\n\nCoule\u00e9 has said it is important to them to use their career in drag to inspire people. In an interview with Seattle Gay Scene, they said, \"I would say the influence I would like to have on the queer community would be to inspire people\u2014specifically queer POC\u2014to feel comfortable in themselves and their identities, to understand that they're special, they're amazing, and that anything you want or dream about, you deserve it.\"[83] They have been particularly outspoken about racial equality, especially within the RuPaul's Drag Race fandom and drag community. In October 2018, Coule\u00e9 interviewed The Vixen about racism in America for the UK's Black History Month edition of Gay Times.[84] In another interview with Gay Times UK, Coule\u00e9 discusses the importance of supporting and uplifting trans women of color.[85]\nCoule\u00e9 has spoken against President Donald Trump.[86] Specifically, in reaction to Trump's potential policy eliminating transgender recognition, they wrote:\n\n\"Dear Trump: You don't tell women what to do with their bodies. You don't get to define gender. You don't have the qualifications to do so. You don't have a spine. You don't have a clue. We won't take this lying down. November is coming. Look how orange you fucking look girl.\"[87]\nContinuing their political activism, Coule\u00e9 has publicly endorsed Presidential Candidate Elizabeth Warren,[88] and spoke at Warren's DragCon NYC booth, encouraging people to vote for her in the 2020 United States presidential election.[89] They also marched alongside Warren at the Las Vegas Pride Parade.[90] In 2020, Coule\u00e9 participated and spoke at the Drag March for Change in support for the Black Lives Matter movement.[91]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMerrell identifies as gay and non-binary,[92][93] preferring singular they pronouns when out of drag[94] and goes by she and her while in drag.[95]\nAt one point, they suffered from bulimia.[96] In 2018, Coule\u00e9 received corrective dental surgery, something they had wanted since they were a teenager.[97]\nShea has three drag daughters, Kenzie Coule\u00e9,[98] Bambi-Banks Coule\u00e9, whom she adopted into her family in 2018,[99] and Khloe Coule\u00e9, whom she publicly announced as her newest drag daughter on June 12, 2020.[100] Shea, Kenzie, Bambi, and Khloe represent the current members of Shea's drag house, Maison Coule\u00e9.[citation needed]\nCoule\u00e9 has named Naomi Campbell, Grace Jones, Beyonc\u00e9, Michael Jackson, Josephine Baker, Diana Ross, and Stevie Wonder as personal icons and influences.[3]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nEPs[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nDetails\n\nRef\n\n\nCoule\u00e9-D\n\n\nReleased: June 23, 2017\nLabel: self-released\nFormats: digital download\n\n[39]\n\nSingles[edit]\nAs lead artist[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSong\n\nYear\n\nAlbum\n\nRef\n\n\n\"Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\"\n\n2018\n\nNon-album singles\n\n[101]\n\n\n\"Gasoline\"(with GESS)\n\n[64]\n\n\n\"Brand New\"\n\n2019\n\n[102]\n\n\n\"Rewind\"(with GESS)\n\n[103]\n\n\n\"Collide\"(with GESS featuring Mykki Blanco)\n\n2020\n\nTBA\n\n[104]\n\nAs featured artist[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nAlbum\n\nRef(s)\n\n\n\"Category Is\"(RuPaul feauring The Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race, Season 9)\n\n2018\n\nNon-album single\n\n[105]\n\n\n\"R U Mad (John \"J-C\" Carr & Bill Colemax Mix)\"(Michael Blume featuring Shea Coulee and Peppermint)\n\nCynicism & Sincerity\n\n[106]\n\n\n\"Symphony\"(GESS featuring Shea Coulee)\n\nPlastic City\n\n[107]\n\n\n\"Snooze\"(Big Dipper featuring Shea Coulee)\n\nLate Bloomer\n\n[108]\n\n\n\"Room, Pt. 2\"(The Vixen featuring Shea Coulee)\n\nNon-album single\n\n[109]\n\n\n\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\"(Aja featuring Shea Coulee)\n\n2019\n\nBOX Office\n\n[110]\n\n\n\"Double Filter Face\"(Shawn Hollenbach featuring Shea Coulee)\n\nNon-album single\n\n[65]\n\n\n\"I'm in Love\"(with the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, Season 5)\n\n2020\n\n[111]\n\n\n\"Clap Back\"(RuPaul featuring the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, Season 5)\n\n[7]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nMovies[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\nRef\n\n\n2016\n\nLipstick City\n\nMrs. Coulee / Shea\n\nWriter / Producer\n\n[38]\n\n\n2020\n\nSavage X Fenty Show Vol. 2\n\nHerself\n\nFashion special\n\n[80]\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nRef(s)\n\n\n2015-16\n\nYou're So Talented\n\nShea\n\n[112]\n\n\n2017\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)\n\nContestant (3rd/4th Place)\n\n[16]\n\n\nBreakfast Television Toronto\n\nGuest\n\n[113]\n\n\nWGN-TV\n\nGuest\n\n[114]\n\n\n2018\n\nHey Qween\n\nGuest\n\n[9]\n\n\nWindy City Live\n\nGuest\n\n[115]\n\n\n2020\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (season 5)\n\nContestant (Winner)\n\n[6]\n\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race All Stars: Untucked (season 5)\n\n[116]\n\nMusic videos[edit]\nAs lead artist[edit]\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nNotes\n\nRef(s)\n\n\n2017\n\n\"Cocky\"(feat.

Noted for her distinctive raspy voice,[7][8] her music spans a range of styles, from pop and country pop to hip hop, experimental and rock. Cyrus is the best-selling female artist born in the 1990s, and has attained the most US Billboard 200 top-ten albums in the 21st century by a female artist, with a total of thirteen entries. Her personal life, public image, and performances have often sparked controversy and received widespread media coverage.\nCyrus, a daughter of country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus, emerged as a teen idol while portraying the title character of the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006\u20132011). As Hannah Montana, she attained two number-one and three top-ten soundtracks on the US Billboard 200, including the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single \"He Could Be the One\". Cyrus' own discography includes the US number-one albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), Breakout (2008), and Bangerz (2013); the top-five releases Can't Be Tamed (2010), Younger Now (2017), Plastic Hearts (2020) and the free SoundCloud album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015). Cyrus' EPs The Time of Our Lives (2009) and She Is Coming (2019) also debuted in the top-five. Plastic Hearts is Cyrus' most acclaimed album on Metacritic and became her first entry on the Billboard Rock Chart, debuting atop the chart. Its lead single \"Midnight Sky\" ignited her commercial resurgence. Her other singles include the US top ten-charting \"See You Again\", \"7 Things\", \"The Climb\", \"Party in the U.S.A.\", \"Can't Be Tamed\", \"We Can't Stop\", \"Malibu\"; and the chart-topping \"Wrecking Ball\". \nCyrus' career accolades include entries on the Time 100 list in 2008 and 2014, MTV's Best Artist of 2013 Award, and placement on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart in 2019.[9] She is often regarded as one of the few examples of successful child actors-turned-singers.[10]\nAs an actress, Cyrus has made appearances in the animated film Bolt (2008) and the feature films Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009) and The Last Song (2010). On television, Cyrus served as a coach on the singing competition series The Voice across two seasons and starred in an episode of the Netflix series Black Mirror (2019). Cyrus is an advocate for animal rights and adopted a vegan lifestyle in 2014; she founded the non-profit Happy Hippie Foundation in 2014, which focuses on youth homelessness and the LGBT community.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n\n1.1 1992\u20132005: Early life and career beginnings\n1.2 2006\u20132009: Hannah Montana and early musical releases\n1.3 2010\u20132012: Can't Be Tamed and focus on acting\n1.4 2013\u20132015: Bangerz and Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz\n1.5 2016\u20132017: The Voice and Younger Now\n1.6 2018\u20132019: Black Mirror, She Is Coming and festival tour\n1.7 2020: Plastic Hearts and commercial resurgence\n\n\n2 Artistry\n\n2.1 Musical style and influences\n2.2 Stage performances\n\n\n3 Philanthropy\n\n3.1 Happy Hippie Foundation\n\n\n4 Public image\n5 Personal life\n\n5.1 Sexuality and gender\n5.2 Cannabis use\n5.3 Relationships\n5.4 Religious beliefs\n5.5 Diet\n\n\n6 Discography\n7 Filmography\n8 Tours\n9 See also\n10 References\n11 Further reading\n12 External links\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\n1992\u20132005: Early life and career beginnings[edit]\nDestiny Hope Cyrus was born November 23, 1992, in Franklin, Tennessee,[11] to Leticia \"Tish\" Jean Finley, who is of Irish American Roman Catholic heritage, and country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, who is of Scots-Irish American Presbyterian heritage. Her parents married the year following her birth.[11] Cyrus was born with supraventricular tachycardia, a condition causing an abnormal resting heart rate.[12] Her birth name, Destiny Hope, expressed her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things. Her parents nicknamed her \"Smiley\", which they later shortened to \"Miley\", because she often smiled as an infant.[13] In 2008, she legally changed her name to Miley Ray Cyrus; her middle name honors her grandfather, Democratic politician Ronald Ray Cyrus from Kentucky.[14] Cyrus' godmother is singer-songwriter Dolly Parton.[15]\nAgainst the advice of her father's record company,[16] Cyrus' parents secretly married on December 28, 1993, a year after her birth.[17] They had two more children together, son Braison and daughter Noah.[18] From previous relationships, her mother has two other children, Brandi and Trace.[19] Her father's first child, Christopher Cody, was born in April 1992[17] and grew up with his mother, Kristin Luckey, in South Carolina.[16]\nAll of Cyrus' maternal siblings are established entertainers. Trace is a vocalist and guitarist for the electronic pop band Metro Station.[20] Noah is an actress and, along with Braison, models, singers, and songwriters.[21][22][23][24][25] Brandi was formerly a musician for the indie rock band Frank + Derol[26][27] and is a professional DJ. The Cyrus farmhouse is located on 500 acres of land outside Nashville, Tennessee.[28]\nCyrus attended Heritage Elementary School in Williamson County, when her family lived in Thompson's Station, Tennessee.[29] When she was cast in Hannah Montana, the family moved to Los Angeles, where she attended Options for Youth Charter Schools[30] and studied with a private tutor on set.[31] Raised Christian, she was baptized in a Southern Baptist church before moving to Hollywood in 2005.[32] She attended church regularly while growing up and wore a purity ring.[33] In 2001, when Cyrus was eight, she and her family moved to Toronto, Canada, while her father filmed the television series Doc.[34] After Billy Ray took her to see a 2001 Mirvish production of Mamma Mia! at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Cyrus grabbed his arm and told him, \"This is what I want to do, daddy. I want to be an actress.\"[35] She began singing and acting lessons at the Armstrong Acting Studio in Toronto.[36]\nCyrus' first acting role was as Kylie in her father's television series Doc.[13] In 2003, she received credit under her birth name for her role as \"Young Ruthie\" in Tim Burton's Big Fish.[37] During this period, she auditioned with Taylor Lautner for the feature film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. Although she was one of two finalists for the role, she chose to appear in Hannah Montana instead.[38]\nHer mother took on the role of Miley's manager and worked to acquire a team to build her daughter's career.[39] Cyrus signed with Mitchell Gossett, director of the youth division at Cunningham Escott Slevin Doherty.[40] Gossett is often credited with \"discovering\" Cyrus and played a key role in her auditioning for Hannah Montana.[41] She later signed with Jason Morey of Morey Management Group to handle her music career, having been directed to him by Dolly Parton.[39] She hired her father's finance manager as part of her team.[39]\n\n2006\u20132009: Hannah Montana and early musical releases[edit]\n Cyrus performing on her Best of Both Worlds Tour in 2007\nCyrus auditioned for the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana when she was eleven years old.[42] She auditioned for the role of the title character's best friend, but was called to audition for the lead role instead.[42] Despite being denied the part at first because she was \"too small and too young\" for the role,[43] she was later cast as the lead because of her singing and acting abilities.[44] The series premiered in March 2006 to the largest audience for a Disney Channel program[45] and quickly ranked among the highest-rated series on basic cable.[46] The success of the series led to Cyrus being labeled a \"teen idol\".[37][47] She toured with the Cheetah Girls as Hannah Montana in September 2006, performing songs from the show's first season.[48] Walt Disney Records released a soundtrack credited to Cyrus' character in October of that year.[49] The record was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 chart in the United States;

She said she wanted to bring attention and celebrate people who wouldn't normally find themselves being the stars of a photo shoot or wouldn't find themselves on the cover of a magazine.[297]\nFollowing the loss of their Malibu home from the Woolsey Fire, Cyrus and Hemsworth partnered with their community to launch the Malibu Foundation for relief efforts following the 2018 California wildfires.[298] Through the Happy Hippie Foundation, Cyrus and Hemsworth donated $500,000 to the Malibu Foundation.[299][300]\n\nPublic image[edit]\n Cyrus at the 2012 People's Choice Awards\nIn the early years of her career, Cyrus had a generally wholesome image as a teen idol.[301] Her fame increased dramatically following the Vanity Fair photo scandal, and it was reported that photos of Cyrus could be shopped for $2,000 apiece.[301] In the following years, Cyrus' image continued to shift dramatically from her previous teen idol status.[301] Donny Osmond wrote of Cyrus' transition into adulthood: \"Miley will have to face adulthood..... As she does, she'll want to change her image, and that change will be met with adversity.\"[302] The release of Can't Be Tamed (2010) saw Cyrus officially attempting to distance herself from her teenage persona, releasing controversial music videos for her songs \"Can't Be Tamed\" (2010) and \"Who Owns My Heart\" (2010).[303][304] Her behavior sparked considerable controversy throughout 2013 and 2014, although her godmother Dolly Parton stated \"...the girl can write. The girl can sing. The girl is smart. And she doesn't have to be so drastic. But I will respect her choices. I did it my way, so why can't she do it her way?\"[305]\nCyrus was placed at number seventeen on Forbes' list of the most powerful celebrities in 2014, the magazine noting that \"The last time she made our list was when she was still rolling in Hannah Montana money. Now the pop singer is all grown up and courting controversy at every turn.\"[3] In August 2014, her life was documented in a comic book called Fame: Miley Cyrus, starting with her 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance to her Disney fame and exploring her childhood in Tennessee.[306] The comic book was written by Michael L. Frizell and drawn by Juan Luis Rinc\u00f3n and is available in both print and digital formats.[307] In September 2010, Cyrus placed tenth on Billboard's first-ever list of Music's Hottest Minors of 2010[308] and was ranked twenty-first in 2011[309] and eighteenth in 2012.[310] In May 2013, Maxim ranked Cyrus first on their Hot 100 of the year.[311] Cyrus was chosen by Time magazine as one of their finalists for Person of the Year in November 2013;[312] she came in third place with 16.3% of the staff vote.[313] In March 2014, Skidmore College in New York began offering a special topics sociology course entitled \"The Sociology of Miley Cyrus: Race, Class, Gender and Media\" which was \"using Miley as a lens through which to explore sociological thinking about identity, entertainment, media and fame\".[314] In 2015, Cyrus was listed as one of the nine runners-up for The Advocate's Person of the Year.[315]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSexuality and gender[edit]\nCyrus came out as pansexual to her mother at age 14[316][317][318] and has said: \"I never want to label myself! I am ready to love anyone that loves me for who I am! I am open.\"[319] In June 2015, Time magazine reported she is gender fluid.[320][317][318][319] She was quoted as stating she \"doesn't relate to being boy or girl, and I don't have to have my partner relate to boy or girl.\"[321] Cyrus stated she is \"literally open to every single thing that is consenting and doesn't involve an animal and everyone is of age\".[316]\nCyrus is a supporter of the LGBT community.[322] Her song \"My Heart Beats for Love\" (2010) was written for one of Cyrus' gay friends,[323] while she has since claimed London to be her favorite place to perform due to its extensive gay scene.[324] Cyrus also has an equals sign tattooed on her ring finger in support of same-sex marriage.[325] After her 2018 marriage to a man, Cyrus went on the record to state she still identified as queer.[326] She is the founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, which works to \"Fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations\".[293]\n\nCannabis use[edit]\nCyrus has been open about her recreational use of cannabis.[327][328] She told Rolling Stone in 2013 that it was \"the best drug on earth\" and called it, along with MDMA, a \"happy drug\".[329] While accepting the Best Video Award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus smoked what appeared to be a joint onstage; this was removed from the delayed broadcast of the show in the United States.[330] In a 2014 interview with W magazine, Cyrus stated \"I love weed\" and \"I just love getting stoned.\"[331] In a 2017 interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Cyrus revealed that she had quit cannabis before the press tour for her Younger Now album so she could be \"super clear\" when discussing the record.[332] During a 2018 interview with Andy Cohen, she credited her mother for reintroducing her to cannabis.[333] In 2019, Cyrus sent \"Nothing Breaks Like a Heart\" collaborator Mark Ronson a cannabis bouquet from Lowell Herb Co as a tongue-in-cheek Valentine's Day gift.[334] She invested in the cannabis company in August.[335]\nPrior to undergoing vocal cord surgery in November 2019, and after her post-operative recovery, Cyrus has stated that she has stayed sober from the use of cannabis and alcohol.[336][337][338][339]\n\nRelationships[edit]\nCyrus has stated that she dated singer-actor Nick Jonas from June 2006 to December 2007,[340] claiming they were \"in love\" and began dating soon after they first met.[341] Their relationship attracted considerable media attention.[342] Cyrus was in a nine-month relationship with model Justin Gaston from 2008 to 2009.[343] While filming The Last Song, Cyrus began an on-again, off-again relationship with her co-star Liam Hemsworth in 2009.[344] During the breakups, Cyrus was romantically linked to actors Lucas Till (2009) and Josh Bowman (2011).[345] Cyrus and Hemsworth were first engaged from May 2012 until September 2013.[346][347] After, she dated for a few months producer Mike Will Made It (2013), actor Patrick Schwarzenegger (2014\u201315), model Stella Maxwell (2015), and comedian Dane Cook (2016).[348][344][349]\nCyrus and Hemsworth rekindled their relationship in March 2016,[350][351] and became re-engaged that October.[352] In November 2018, Cyrus and Hemsworth's home burned down in the Woolsey Fire in California.[353][354] On December 23, Cyrus and Hemsworth married in a private wedding ceremony in their home in Nashville, Tennessee.[355] She felt that her marriage \"[redefined] what it looks like for someone that's a queer person like [herself] to be in a hetero relationship\" though she was \"still very sexually attracted to women\". Cyrus indicated that the ceremony was \"kind of out of character for [her]\" because \"[they have] worn rings forever [and] definitely didn't need it in any way\". She believed the loss of their home to be the catalyst for getting married, citing that \"the timing felt right\" and that \"no one is promised the next day, or the next, so [she tries] to be 'in the now' as much as possible\".[356] On August 10, 2019, Cyrus announced their separation.[357] Eleven days later, Hemsworth filed for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\".[358] To commemorate her divorce from Hemsworth, Cyrus had a note written to her from Yoko Ono tattooed on her left shoulder blade.[359] On January 28, 2020, their divorce had been finalized.[360]\nFollowing the announcement of her separation from Hemsworth, she dated Kaitlynn Carter from August to September 2019.[361][362][363]\nIn October 2019, Cyrus began dating Australian singer Cody Simpson, a longtime friend.[364] In August 2020, Cyrus announced that she and Simpson had split up.[365] Her announcement coincided with the release of her single \"Midnight Sky\", which was inspired by her breakups with Hemsworth, Carter, and Simpson.[366][367][368]\nCyrus adopted an abandoned bulldog in August 2020. Daisy the bulldog was rescued by firefighters in April 2020, and joined Cyrus' other adopted dogs in August.[369]\n\nReligious beliefs[edit]\nCyrus was raised as a Christian and identified herself as such during her childhood and early adult life.[32] Cyrus includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics to her song \"Milky Milky Milk\" (2015).[370]\n\nDiet[edit]\nFrom 2013 to 2019, Cyrus followed a strict vegan diet.[371] She professed in September 2020 to no longer being a vegan, for health reasons, commenting: \"I was vegan for a very long time and I've had to introduce fish and omegas into my life because my brain wasn't functioning properly.\"[371] Cyrus currently identifies as a pescatarian.[372]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nMain articles: Miley Cyrus discography, songs, and Hannah Montana discography\nMeet Miley Cyrus (2007)\nBreakout (2008)\nCan't Be Tamed (2010)\nBangerz (2013)\nMiley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015)\nYounger Now (2017)\nPlastic Hearts (2020)\nFilmography[edit]\nMain article: Miley Cyrus videography\nBig Fish (2003)\nHannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008)\nBolt (2008)\nHannah Montana: The Movie (2009)\nThe Last Song (2010)\nLOL (2012)\nSo Undercover (2012)\nMiley: The Movement (2013)\nThe Night Before (2015)\nA Very Murray Christmas (2015)\nCrisis in Six Scenes (2016)\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)\nTours[edit]\nMain article: List of Miley Cyrus live performances\nBest of Both Worlds Tour (2007\u20132008)\nWonder World Tour (2009)\nGypsy Heart Tour (2011)\nBangerz Tour (2014)\nMilky Milky Milk Tour (2015)\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nUnited States portal\nBiography portal\nPop music portal\nHonorific nicknames in popular music\nList of awards and nominations received by Miley Cyrus\nList of Billboard Social 50 number-one artists\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Mandell, Andrea (February 8, 2019). \"Yep, Miley Cyrus took Liam Hemsworth's last name.

Her most notable roles include Margo Roth Spiegelman in the romantic mystery film Paper Towns (2015), the Enchantress in the comic book film Suicide Squad (2016), and Laureline in Luc Besson's Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017).\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Modelling career\n\n2.1.1 2002\u20132014: Career beginnings\n2.1.2 2012\u20132014: Breakthrough\n2.1.3 2015\u2013present: Hiatus\n\n\n2.2 Acting career\n2.3 Music\n2.4 Design\n2.5 Writing\n\n\n3 Media rankings\n4 Personal life\n5 Ancestry\n6 Awards and nominations\n7 Filmography\n\n7.1 Film\n7.2 Television\n7.3 Music videos\n7.4 Director\n7.5 Video game\n7.6 Commercials\n7.7 Cameos as herself\n\n\n8 Discography\n9 Bibliography\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nCara Jocelyn Delevingne was born on 12 August 1992,[10] in Hammersmith, London, the daughter of Pandora Anne Delevigne (n\u00e9e Stevens) and property developer Charles Hamar Delevingne. She grew up in Belgravia, London.[11][12] She has two older sisters, Chloe and Poppy Delevingne, and a paternal half-brother, Alex Jaffe.[13] Delevingne attended Francis Holland School for Girls in central London until she was 16[8] before moving to Bedales School in Steep, Hampshire. She has dyspraxia and found school challenging.[14] In June 2015, in an interview with Vogue, Delevingne talked about her battle with depression when she was 15: \"I was hit with a massive wave of depression and anxiety and self-hatred, where the feelings were so painful that I would slam my head against a tree to try to knock myself out.\"[12] At 16, after completing her GCSEs, she moved to Bedales School in Hampshire to focus on drama and music. After one year, she dropped out and followed her sister Poppy into modelling.[8]\nDelevingne's godfather is Cond\u00e9 Nast executive Nicholas Coleridge,[15][16] and her godmother is actress Joan Collins.[17] Her maternal grandfather was publishing executive and English Heritage chairman Sir Jocelyn Stevens,[11][15] the nephew of magazine publisher Sir Edward George Warris Hulton and the grandson of newspaper proprietor Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet.[18][19] Her paternal great-grandfather was the Canadian-born British politician Hamar Greenwood, 1st Viscount Greenwood,[20][11] and her maternal grandmother Janie Sheffield was lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret.[11][21] Through one of her maternal great-great-grandfathers, Sir Lionel Lawson Faudel-Phillips, 3rd Baronet, Delevingne descends from the Anglo-Jewish Faudel-Phillips baronets; two of her ancestors on that line served as Lord Mayor of London.[22]\n\nCareer[edit]\nModelling career[edit]\n Delevingne at London Fashion Week in September 2014\n2002\u20132014: Career beginnings[edit]\nDelevingne had her first modelling job at age ten in an editorial shot by Bruce Weber for Vogue Italia alongside model Lady Eloise Anson.[23] She signed with Storm Management in 2009. She worked in the industry for a year before booking a paying job and went through two seasons of castings before landing her first runway show.[12]\nDelevingne was scouted by Burberry's Christopher Bailey in 2012 while working part-time in the office of a fashion website.[24] Bailey cast her in the company's spring/summer 2011 campaign.[8]\nDelevingne's first catwalk appearance was at the February 2011 London Fashion Week, walking for the Burberry Prorsum A/W collection.[25] Later that year, she opened and closed the Burberry Prorsum S/S 2012 collection.[26]\n\n2012\u20132014: Breakthrough[edit]\nShe commenced the early 2012 season by walking in the Chanel Haute-Couture spring show at the Grand Palais.[27]\nNew York Fashion Week was the first of the \"big four\" fashion weeks, where Delevingne walked in nine shows for fashion houses including Jason Wu, Rag & Bone, Thakoon, Donna Karan, Tory Burch, Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera.[28] During London Fashion Week, she exclusively walked for the Burberry Prorsum Womenswear A/W 2012 show. She walked in six shows during the Milan Fashion Week, and walked for Fendi, Trussardi, Moschino, Blumarine, DSquared2 and Dolce & Gabbana.\nParis Fashion Week was the final week of Fashion Month, in which she walked in seven shows for Nina Ricci, Sonia Rykiel, Cacharel, Stella McCartney, Paul & Joe, Kenzo and Chanel. This was the beginning of what would turn out to be a longlasting professional relationship with Chanel's head designer and creative director, Karl Lagerfeld. In an interview with Elle after the show, Lagerfeld said, \"Cara is different. She's full of life, full of pep. I like girls to be wild but at the same time beautifully brought up and very funny.\"[29]\nOver the course of Fashion Month, she had walked in more than 20 shows and gained media recognition. Vogue described her as their 'crush of the season' and The Daily Telegraph picked up very early, while in New York, on her becoming 'THE' girl of the season after walking in the Jason Wu and Rag & Bone shows.[8]\nThe international Fashion Month began again in September 2012, to showcase spring/summer collections for 2013. During New York Fashion Week, she walked for designers including Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta and Marchesa.\nShe walked exclusively for Burberry in London.[30] She followed this appearance by walking in shows for Sass & Bide, Issa, Preen, Topshop, Mary Katrantzou, Giles, and Matthew Williamson.\nFor Milan Fashion Week, she walked for Moschino, Emilio Pucci, Ermanno Scervino, Ports 1961, Anteprima, Iceberg, Gabriele Colangelo, Anthony Vaccarello, and Just Cavalli.\nFor Paris Fashion Week, she walked for designers such as Cacharel, Louis Vuitton, and Costume National.[31][32]\nOver this season she had walked in over 50 shows.[8] Delevingne then went on to appear in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on 7 November 2012. She featured in the 'Pink is US' section and walked during Justin Bieber's performance of 'Beauty And A Beat'. The show aired on 4 December 2012.\nShe took part in the Chanel pre-fall 2013 show in Scotland with the runway around the courtyard of Linlithgow Palace. The collection, designed by Karl Lagerfeld, was called \"Paris-Edimbourg\" and inspired by Scottish style using tartan fabrics. The show renewed media interest in the possibility of restoring the roof of the palace.[33][34][35]\nDelevingne walked in the Chanel Haute-Couture spring show and followed this up with an appearance in the Valentino Haute Couture show before flying to New York to take part in New York Fashion Week, the first fashion week of the year. Her first appearance in New York was for Jason Wu. She subsequently walked for Rag & Bone, Tommy Hilfiger, Diane von Furstenberg, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Rodarte, Derek Lam, DKNY, Carolina Herrera, Tory Burch, Jeremy Scott, Oscar de la Renta, Michael Kors, Anna Sui and finally Marc Jacobs' rearranged show, due to a delay in transportation of goods for the show due to the February 2013 nor'easter.[8]\nDuring London Fashion Week she walked for Sister by Sibling, Issa, Topshop, Mulberry, Matthew Williamson, Peter Pilotto, Burberry and Giles. After this Delevingne walked in another seven shows at the Milan Fashion Week for Fendi, Ports 1961, DSquared2, Etro, Versace, Iceberg and Pucci.\nIn Paris, Delevingne walked in eleven shows for Katie Grand's collaboration with Tod's Hogan brand, H&M, Lanvin, Vanessa Bruno, Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Hakaan and Louis Vuitton. Delevingne's association with Katie Grand's collection went further than a catwalk show appearance as Delevingne sung 'I Want Candy' in the mini film called 'Gang', which is the title of the Katie Grand Loves Hogan 2013 collection and the name of the large-format magazine created to celebrate the collaboration.\nIn between the two international catwalk seasons, Delevingne was featured in Chanel's Cruise show which took place in Singapore. It was the first time Chanel had held this event in Asia and was held at the Loewen Cluster at Dempsey Hill, a British army barracks turned Singapore Armed Forces manpower base.[36]\nThe international fashion weeks began again in September 2013, to showcase spring/summer collections for 2014. In the first week, New York, she walked in only one show for Marc Jacobs in a show to which Style.com commented that, \"...took us on a trip to the 1890s. The set looked like a bombed-out beach, with cigarette butts, Big Gulp cups, a tumbled-over Frozen Treats case, and destroyed fashion magazines strewn in the black sand.\"[37]\nIn London, she walked in five shows. She opened for Mulberry and closed for Burberry and Topshop as well as walking Peter Pilotto and Giles. In Milan, Delevingne only walked for Fendi; she walked in just three shows in Paris for Stella McCartney, Chanel and Valentino. She rounded off the year by again appearing in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\n2015\u2013present: Hiatus[edit]\nIt was noted by many that Delevingne had started to become more selective with the shows she appeared in. This was the beginning of the decrease in volume of catwalk roles, the cause of which at the time was put down to her expanding acting career.[38] However, in a Time essay published in 2016, Delevingne explained the real cause for the decrease of show appearances:\n\nIt's taken time, but now I realize that work isn't everything and success comes in many forms. I've opened my mind, and now I embrace new things with a childlike curiosity. I'm spending more time doing the stuff I love. And I've been able to do better work because of it.[1]\nIn January 2014, Delevingne opened and closed the Chanel Haute Couture Spring 2014 show.[39] In the A/W 2014 collection showcases she went on to close Burberry's show in the London Fashion Week and appear in fellow British designer Giles' collection.[40]\nIn Milan, she opened Fendi's F/W 2014 collection for Karl Lagerfeld, before modelling for Stella McCartney in Paris. Her absence in New York was noticed due to Delevingne going from walking in 'just about every single show out there' to only walking in the Marc Jacobs show in 2013. News outlets wrote headlines such as, \"Will Cara Delevingne Walk in New York Fashion Week?\" in the run up to the fashion week.[41]\nDelevingne appeared in a Burberry fragrance advertisement alongside British supermodel Kate Moss.[42]\nIn the second international fashion month, she opened and closed Topshop's 'Unique S/S 15' collection in London, before going to Milan where she also opened the Fendi S/S 15 show. In Paris, she walked in four shows for Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel and Stella McCartney. She finished 2014 with the Metiers d'Art Pre-Fall 2015/2016 collection showcase. The event was held at the Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg, Austria.[43]\nOn 10 March, Delevingne closed the showcase of Chanel's Paris-Salzberg collection and closed a reshow of the collection in New York on 31 March.[44]\nIn 2015, Delevingne appeared in advertisements for YSL Beaut\u00e9, co-starring French model Cindy Bruna.[45] She also appeared in advertisements for DKNY (including a menswear campaign),[46][47] Tag Heuer,[48] Penshoppe,[49] Pepe Jeans,[50] Burberry, Alexander Wang,[51] and Mango reuniting with Kate Moss.[52]\nDelevigne appeared on a solo cover of Vogue,[12] as well as The Wall Street Journal,[53] and Love alongside Kendall Jenner, among others.[54]\nIn 2016, Delevingne became the face of Rimmel alongside Kate Moss and Georgia May Jagger.[55]\nShe continued appearing in ads for Burberry, Tag Heuer, Chanel, Marc Jacobs, YSL, and Puma.\nIn 2017, Delevingne appeared on the cover of the online magazine The Edit by luxury fashion retailer Net-a-Porter.[56] She also appeared on the cover of Glamour,[57] V,[58] British GQ,[59] Vogue Paris,[60] Elle UK,[61] Elle Australia, and Glamour Germany. She began appearing in Dior Beauty advertisements.[62]\n\nActing career[edit]\nDelevingne played her first film role in the 2012 film adaptation of Anna Karenina, as Princess Sorokina, the marriage interest of Count Vronsky, alongside Keira Knightley.[17] In August 2013, Delevingne voiced a DJ of a pop radio station in the video game Grand Theft Auto V, which once released became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history.[63][64][65]\nIn June 2014, Delevingne made her TV debut in the final episode of Playhouse Presents. This was a series of self-contained TV plays, made by British broadcaster Sky Arts. Delevingne featured as Chloe, opposite veteran British actress Sylvia Syms.[66][67]\n\n Delevingne at the premiere of Paper Towns in July 2015\nDelevingne went on to play the part of Melanie in the British psychological thriller film The Face of an Angel, accompanied by Daniel Br\u00fchl and Kate Beckinsale.[68] The film received mixed reviews, but many critics commended Delevingne's performance. One such example is The Metro which commented that, \"In her first major film role, she proves she can act with a sweet and playful on-screen presence. She brings a sense of vitality that is desperately missing from the rest of the film.\"[69]\nOn 24 October 2014, she starred in a sketch for an annual 90-minute comedy TV event called The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night, which aired on Channel 4 and was designed to raise awareness of testicular cancer.[70] A month later, she featured in South African group Die Antwoord's music video for their song Ugly Boy.[71] Then in December 2014, Delevingne starred in Reincarnation, a short film by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel alongside Pharrell Williams and Geraldine Chaplin.[72]\nIn February 2015, Delevingne appeared in ASAP Ferg's music video for his song Dope Walk.[73] Later in May 2015, she was also in Taylor Swift's star studded \"Bad Blood\" music video which went on to break Vevo's 24-hour viewing record, with 20.1 million views in its day of release.[74][75]\nDelevingne co-starred in the adaptation of John Green's novel, Paper Towns (2015), as Margo Roth Spiegelman.[76][77] The film brought in $12,650,140 on the opening weekend in the US, which placed it 6th at the box office.[78] Rotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reads, \"Paper Towns isn't as deep or moving as it wants to be, yet it's still earnest, well-acted, and thoughtful enough to earn a place in the hearts of teen filmgoers of all ages.\"[79] Of Delevingne's performance, Justin Chang of Variety called her \"the real find of the film\", suggesting that \"on the evidence of her work here, this striking actress is here to stay\".[80]\nShe played a mermaid in the 2015 fantasy film Pan.[81] In 2016, Delevingne co-starred as Enchantress, a villainess with magical abilities, in Suicide Squad, an action film based on the DC comic book series of the same name.[82][83] The film was released to generally negative reviews, although it was a box office success. Delevingne's performance received mixed reviews from critics.\nThe film Kids in Love, a British coming of age drama, was released in 2016. The cast includes many up and coming young actors, with Will Poulter and Alma Jodorowsky as lead roles alongside Sebastian de Souza and Delevingne who plays the role of Viola.\nDelevingne starred with Dane DeHaan and Rihanna[84] in the Luc Besson film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, an adaptation of the comic book series Val\u00e9rian and Laureline. The film began shooting in December 2015, and was released in July 2017.[85]\nDelevingne plays Annetje in the period romance film Tulip Fever.[86] She also plays the role of Kath Talent in the film London Fields, based on the 1989 novel of the same name by Martin Amis.[66][87][88]\nThe Amazon Prime Video fantasy steampunk series Carnival Row features Delevinge in the female lead role as Vignette Stonemoss, a faerie war refugee.\n\nMusic[edit]\n Delevingne in September 2014\nDelevingne sings, plays the drums and the guitar.[67][89] Over 2011 and 2012, Delevingne wrote and recorded two albums of music under artist manager Simon Fuller and was subsequently offered a record deal. However, she turned the deal down due to the fact that her name would be changed.[90] In 2013, she recorded an acoustic duet cover version of Sonnentanz with British soul and jazz singer-songwriter Will Heard.[91][92] She also covered Bow Wow Wow's \"I Want Candy\" in the mini film called Gang, which was the title of the 2013 A/W Katie Grand Loves Hogan collection and the name of the large-format magazine created to celebrate the collaboration.[93] Delevingne also teamed up with Pharrell Williams to make the song \"CC the World\", which was used for the short Chanel film Reincarnation in which both Pharrell and Delevingne star. This was released to the public on 1 December 2014.[94] The duo performed the song before a live audience for the Chanel show at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City in March 2015. On 28 July 2017, Delevingne released the music video for her song \"I Feel Everything\" from Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.[95] Delevingne's background vocals are featured on the song \"Pills\" from the 2017 studio album, Masseduction, by American musician St. Vincent, whom Delevingne previously dated from 2014 to 2016.[96] Her backing vocals are also featured on the title track of Fiona Apple's 2020 album, Fetch the Bolt Cutters.[97]\n\nDesign[edit]\nDelevingne has designed two fashion collections for DKNY and Mulberry. Her DKNY capsule collection featured a variety of sporty street style items ranging from beanie hats to leather jackets. DKNY described the collection as \"mostly unisex\".[98] The collection took approximately two years from the first announcement to when it was released on 15 October 2014.[99]\nDelevingne has also designed four collections for Mulberry featuring rucksacks and handbags. The collection also consisted of purses, iPad sleeves, phone covers, zipped pouches, and passport holders. The fourth and latest collection was released 3 June 2015.[100]\n\nWriting[edit]\nIn October 2017, Delevingne made her debut as a novelist of young adult fiction with her new book Mirror, Mirror, which contains an LGBT theme,[101] co-written with British writer Rowan Coleman. According to Delevingne, she wanted to \"tell a story that gives the reader a realistic picture of the turbulent roller-coaster teenage years.\"[102]\n\nMedia rankings[edit]\nThis section is in list format, but may read better as prose.

Following the killing of Cecil the lion in 2015, she auctioned off her personal TAG Heuer watch in aid of wildlife conservation, raising \u00a318,600 for WildCRU.[119]\nAt the Women in the World summit in October 2015, Delevingne spoke about her battle with depression, which began at age 15,[120] when she discovered her mother's drug addiction. The following year, she left school for six months and agreed to go on medication, which she said may have saved her life.[121] In 2017, on This Morning, she revealed that she also has ADHD.[122]\nIn October 2017, Delevingne alleged that circa 2016, producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her, attempted to kiss her without consent, and propositioned her for a threesome in a hotel room in exchange for a role.[123] Despite declining, she was still cast in the film but says she regretted it as his actions terrified her.[124] The Weinstein Company produced the 2017 film Tulip Fever, which starred Delevigne.

Dillon is non-binary and uses singular they pronouns.[2][3][4] Their role on Billions is the first non-binary main character on North American television,[5] and earned them a Critics' Choice Television Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.[6][7][8] They also played the Adjudicator in the action film John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum (2019).\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Personal life\n3 Credits\n\n3.1 Film\n3.2 Television\n3.3 Video game\n\n\n4 Awards and nominations\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nDillon graduated from the American Musical and Dramatic Academy.[9] They enrolled in and completed the Meisner training program at The Actor's Workshop of Ithaca during their junior year of high school at age sixteen. They were the youngest student ever admitted to the class.[9]\nIn 2007, Dillon took the titular role of Rachel Corrie in the play My Name Is Rachel Corrie.[10] Afterward, they took part in a workshop of plays with Academy Award- and Tony Award-winning playwrights.[11][9] This was followed by a featured lead role as Lucifer in The Mysteries, and a role in The Tempest at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, DC.[12][13]\nDillon played white supremacist Brandy Epps, a penitentiary inmate, in eight episodes of Orange Is the New Black in 2016, making them one of the first non-binary actors cast in a major television show.[9][14] They also played a recurring role in season 2 of Showtime's Wall Street drama Billions in 2017.[15] The role they played is a non-binary character, Taylor Mason, a hedge fund intern,[16] who reports state is the first non-binary character on mainstream North American television.[2][17][18][7] Showtime confirmed in April 2017 that Mason would be a regular character in season 3.[19] When submitting their name for an Emmy Award for acting, Dillon was allowed to submit for whichever gendered category they wished, and chose \"actor\" over \"actress\" because it is a gender neutral word.[20][21] They received submission for supporting actor.[22] Their effort to clarify the matter for all non-binary people prompted the MTV Movie & TV Awards to combine their gender-segregated categories.[23] They presented the award for Best Actor at the MTV Movie & TV Awards on May 7, 2017.[24] In November 2018, it was announced Dillon would star in The Outside Story.[25]\nDillon is the founder and producing director of MIRROR/FIRE Productions.

Dove was voted as SheWired's Most Eligible Bachelorette in 2014[5] and named one of Elle Magazine's 12 Women Who Are Redefining Beauty in 2015.[6]\nA self-described \"gender capitalist\", Dove has written, \"I've never really cared about pronouns for my own descriptors\",[7] and that they disavow personal pronouns and ask people to choose whichever they feel apply: \"Use she, he, it, one, they\u00a0... I honestly don't care\u00a0... All I'm listening for in that sound is positivity.\"[8]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Modeling career\n3 Activism\n4 Personal life\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nAssigned female at birth, Dove spent their early years believing they were ugly: they had a larger physique than other children and youth, and were given the nickname \"Tranny Danny\".[9] Initially, Dove claimed in interviews and biographies to have studied genetic engineering and civil law at University of California, Berkeley. They also claimed to have worked as a Colorado Firefighter under a male pseudonym, and to have passed as a man during this time, for a period of eleven months.[9] However, in late 2019 Dove admitted in a video on NBC News that both of these claims (of having studied genetics and law, and of having been a firefighter) were false.[10]\n\nModeling career[edit]\nDove began a modeling career after being challenged by a friend to present themselves as a man in a Calvin Klein casting for underwear. At the casting, they were handed the outfit for the test shoot, which was just a pair of underwear. When Dove came in topless, the designer responded by giving them a men's shirt and saying \"Swear to God, you will not tell anyone you're a woman!\"[11] After the show, people began seeking Dove for modeling jobs; three months later they accepted their first modeling job and have since walked at New York fashion week on both men's and women's runways.[12]\n\nActivism[edit]\nDuring their final year in high school, Dove intentionally became homeless as a social experiment to \"document how homelessness affected my academics\".[13] After this, Dove became more involved in activism and politics, and said they became interested in working for the United Nations prior to finding a career in fashion: \"I wanted to work for the U.N. (United Nations)\u00a0... I would have applied at the U.N. and would have probably been working in some third world country, or a country that has water rights issues. Gender would be the least of my worries.\"[14]\nDove supported the movement against North Carolina's HB2, which legislated that individuals had to use the restrooms corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates.[13] In 2018, Dove said they were pepper-sprayed in a women's restroom in North Carolina by a woman who thought Dove was a man.[15][16]\nRegarding the fashion industry and gender issues, Dove states that advertising agencies \"aren't some evil illuminati trying to dupe the people into living heteronormative white lifestyles\" and that they are simply \"trying to make money in the safest way possible.\"[17] For example, Dove says of Queer Fashion Week, \"When you have an event like this, you are telling the large conglomerates like Gap, Levi's, H & M etcetera that there is money to be made and there is a desire to represent the queer community in the commercial side of the fashion world. They don't have to be afraid to align themselves with the LGBTQ community.\"[14]\nA new clothing line by the name Phluid Project caught Dove's attention and got their support for being the first major non-binary clothing store in New York, and they participated in a panel as moderator.[18]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nDove describes themself as a \"gender capitalist\", explaining, \"Gender Capitalism is both Feminist and Masculinist. It's everythingist. It's the recognition that I, as an organism, am treated differently based on my perceived genitalia and the identity surrounding that relationship.\"[13] They have also said, \"You can identify with whatever you want. It's just that you recognise how society sees gender and you capitalise on it.\"[8] In their work, this means using acting skills like changes in posture, gait and voice to strategically appear more femme or masculine at different times, both to \"subvert expectations\" of both gender expressions, and to \"maximise opportunity and earnings\".[8]\n\nSee also[edit]\nLeslie Feinberg \u2013 Pioneering author in the field of gender studies who expressed some similar attitudes around shifting pronouns in differing social settings\nLGBTQ culture in New York City\nList of self-identified LGBTQ New Yorkers\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Dove, Rain (2019-12-15). \"Re: EXPOSING MYSELF: Sharing Lies & Secrets\".

Queer Film & Arts Fest, TWIST: Seattle Queer Film Festival, Austin Gay & Lesbian International Film Festival (aGLIFF),[30] Art All Night - Trenton: 6th Annual Film Festival, Desperado LGBT Film Festival, QUEER-Streifen Regensburg, Filmfest homochrom, Flatpack Film Festival, CINEMQ.\nIn 2017, Electra released the single Jackpot through Grindr's digital publication Into More, a song that \"addresses gender fluidity, but in a more subtle, less explicitly educational way.\"[31] Later that year, Electra was featured on the Charli XCX track \"Femmebot\" with Mykki Blanco on the mixtape Pop 2.[32]\nIn 2018, Electra released three new tracks titled \"Career Boy\", \"VIP\", and \"Man to Man\".[33][34][35][36]\nIn 2019, Electra released their debut album, Flamboyant.[37] In August 2019, Electra embarked on the Flamboyant: Chapter I tour, which lasted until November 2019.[38] They began the second leg, Flamboyant: Chapter II, in early 2020. However, in March of the same year, the rest of the tour dates were postponed due to COVID-19. [39]\nIn 2020, Electra released the single \"Thirsty (For Love)\", a collaboration with fans.[40] They also released a deluxe version of \"Flamboyant\" later that year. Following this, they released the singles \"Sorry Bro (I Love You)\", \"Give Great Thanks\", \"Gentleman\", and \"M'Lady\". On September 21, 2020, Electra announced their project My Agenda, featuring appearances from Rebecca Black, Faris Badwan, Pussy Riot, Village People, and Dylan Brady among others. The project was released on October 16, 2020, and is described as exploring \"crisis in masculinity\".[41]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nElectra's father is Paul Gomberg, known as \"the Rockstar Realtor\" in Houston.[42] Their mother is artist and jewelry designer Paula Fridkin. [43] Electra identifies as queer and genderfluid and uses they/them pronouns.[2][44] They were diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.[2][44]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAlbums[edit]\nStudio albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nAlbum details\n\n\nFlamboyant\n\n\nReleased: July 17, 2019[45]\nLabel: Self-released\nFormats: LP, digital download, streaming[46][47]\n\n\nMy Agenda\n\n\nReleased: October 16, 2020\nLabel: Self-released\nFormat: LP, digital download, streaming[48]\n\nInstrumental albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nAlbum details\n\n\nFlamboyant Deluxe (Instrumentals)\n\n\nReleased: May 1, 2020\nLabel: Self-released\nFormats: streaming[49]\n\nDemo albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nAlbum details\n\n\nFlamboyant ~ Voice Memos\n\n\nReleased: May 14, 2020\nLabel: Self-released\nFormats: streaming[50]\n\nSingles[edit]\nAs lead artist[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\"Clitopia\"[51]\n\n2016\n\nNon-album singles\n\n\n\"Mind Body Problem\"[52]\n\n\n\"Vibrator\"[53]\n\n\n\"High Heels\"[54]\n\n\n\"Drag\"(featuring Imp Queen, Lucy Stoole, Eva Young, The Vixen, & London Jade)[55]\n\n\n\"Jackpot\"[56]\n\n2017\n\n\n\"Control\"(featuring Zuri Marley, Chynna, K RIzz and London Jade)\n\n\n\"VIP\" (featuring K Rizz)[57]\n\n2018\n\n\n\"Career Boy\"[58]\n\nFlamboyant\n\n\n\"Man To Man\"[59]\n\n\n\"2 Fast\"\n\n2019\n\nNon-album single\n\n\n\"Flamboyant\"[60]\n\nFlamboyant\n\n\n\"Daddy Like\"[61]\n\n\n\"Thirsty (For Love)\"\n\n2020\n\nNon-album single\n\n\n\"Sorry Bro (I Love You)\"\n\nMy Agenda\n\n\n\"Give Great Thanks\"\n\n\n\"Gentleman\"\n\n\n\"M'Lady\"\n\n\n\"Edgelord\"(featuring Rebecca Black)\n\n\n\"My Agenda\"(featuring Village People and Pussy Riot)[62]\n\nAs a featured artist[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\"Femmebot\"(Charli XCX, Mykki Blanco featuring Dorian Electra)\n\n2017\n\nPop 2[63]\n\n\n\"Open My Eyes\"(Ravenna Golden featuring Dorian Electra)\n\n2018\n\nNon-album single\n\n\n\"Gec 2 \u00dc (Remix)\"(100 Gecs featuring Dorian Electra)\n\n2020\n\n1000 Gecs & The Tree of Clues\n\n\nOther appearances[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nOther artist(s)\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\"Teenage Dirtbag\"\n\n2020\n\nSega Bodega\n\nReestablishing Connections[64]\n\n\n\"Give Great Thanks (Count Baldor Edit)\"\n\nN/A\n\nAppleville (Golden Ticket)[65]\n\nVideos[edit]\n\"I'm in Love with Friedrich Hayek\" (2010)[66]\n\"Roll with the Flow\" (2011)\n\"We Got It 4 Cheap\" (2011)\n\"Party Milk\"[15]\n\"Fast Ca$h\" (2012)\n\"What Mary Didn't Know\"[17]\n\"Forever Young: A Love Song To Ray Kurzweil\"[19]\n\"Ode to the Clitoris\" (2016)[67]\n\"Mind Body Problem\" (2016)[23]\n\"The History of Vibrators\" (2016)[24]\n\"Dark History of High Heels\" (2016)[25]\n\"2000 Years of Drag\" (2016)[26]\n\"Control\" (2017)[27]\n\"Jackpot\" (2017)[31]\n\"Career Boy\" (2018)\n\"V.I.P.\" (2018)[68]\n\"Man to Man\" (2018)[35]\n\"Flamboyant\" (2019)\n\"Daddy Like\" (2019)[69]\n\"Adam & Steve\" (2019)\n\"Guyliner\" (2020)\n\"Malibu\" (Guest appearance) (2020)\n\"Sorry Bro (I Love You)\" (2020)\n\"Give Great Thanks\" (2020)\n\"Gentleman / M'Lady\" (2020)\n\"Edgelord\" (feat.

Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts.[1] Jackson obtained a BFA in dance from the California Institute of the Arts.[2]\n\nCareer[edit]\nDrag[edit]\n Laganja Estranja, Jeffree Star and Gia Gunn at RuPaul's DragCon LA 2018\nLaganja Estranja's drag debut was at Micky's West Hollywood on November 7, 2011.[3] After winning the Amateur Competition, Laganja became an official \"Showgirl\" with a monthly gig at Micky's. Laganja went on to win \"Queen of Queens\" at 340 Nightclub in Pomona, CA and \"Best Newcomer\" in West Hollywood.[4]\nIn April 2013 Laganja Estranja auditioned for RuPaul's Drag Race.[5] She was accepted onto the show, and filmed in the summer of 2013.\nIn 2014, the sixth season of drag-oriented reality competition RuPaul's Drag Race aired on LogoTV.[6] Laganja performed moderately well on the show, winning a challenge while partnered with eventual runner-up Adore Delano.[7] Laganja was eliminated in the eighth episode of the season, placing her in a small category of contestants in the show's history who were eliminated the week after winning a challenge.[7] At the outset of the show, Laganja received quite a lot of attention on social media for her now-iconic entrance.[8] During the show, Laganja became infamous for her over-the-top dramatics, catchphrases, and emotional breakdowns. Eventual winner Bianca Del Rio credited Laganja as the root of every memorable quote from the following season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[9] Laganja's mannerisms have since been parodied by fellow drag queens, including Alaska Thunderfuck.[10]\nLaganja Estranja is the drag daughter of Alyssa Edwards, and the drag sister of Shangela[6] and Plastique Tiara \u2014all of whom competed on RuPaul's Drag Race, Edwards appearing on season 5 and season 2 of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, Wadley appearing on season 2 and 3 and All Stars season 3, and Tiara on season 11. Under the moniker of the Haus of Edwards, they have internationally toured and performed together on multiple occasions,[11] most notably at the pre-show warm-up for the finale episode of the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[12]\nIn 2018, Laganja Estranja was interviewed by Billboard Pride for her notable role in the drag community. In this interview, Billboard Pride highlights her drag career as well as her choreography work with Miley Cyrus for the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[citation needed]\nLaganja currently hosts her own web show on the drag-centric platform World of Wonder, the same production company behind RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul's DragCon LA, and RuPaul's DragCon NYC.[13]\n\nMusic[edit]\nIn 2014, Laganja contributed vocals to a cover of RuPaul's \"Jealous of My Boogie\", for the album RuPaul Presents: The CoverGurlz. Throughout 2014, Laganja was featured on three singles, contributing a rap verse to each song. In 2015, she released her debut single as a lead artist, titled \"Legs\", which featured American rapper Rye Rye. In June 2015, \"Legs\" was rated as the third best song by a RuPaul's Drag Race contestant by Pitchfork Media.[14] In June 2015, Laganja was featured on fellow RuPaul's Drag Race star, Alaska Thunderfuck's debut album, Anus, on the track \"Gimme All Your Money\".[15]\nIn 2016, she released both her third single \"Tease 4U\" and a Christmas Album with the Haus of Edwards.  Her single on the album is entitled \"Green XXXmas,\" and the video featured exotic dancer Candace Cane.[16] In September 2018, she released her fourth single \"Look At Me\" featuring J. Tyler, and an accompanying video. The video took a stance against arrests for marijuana possession.[17] In November 2018, she released a lyric video for her fifth single \"Smoke Break.\"[18]\n\nLifestyle brand[edit]\nThe Laganja Estranja lifestyle brand includes a collaboration preroll joint with San Francisco's The Hepburns, called \"LAhepburns.\"[19] Laganja also partnered with FRUIT SLABS, a company making cannabis infused, vegan, real-fruit squares for their 2019 PRIDE collection. Laganja worked with FRUIT SLABS to create a one-of-a-kind flavor to be offered for a limited time.[20]\n\nCannabis advocacy[edit]\nAs a cannabis rights activist, Laganja has hosted conversations on cannabis legalization at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, and at Impulse in San Francisco.[21] She has also been featured twice in High Times Magazine as well as on the cover of Dope Magazine,[22] making her the first LGBTQ+ advocate on the cover of a cannabis magazine.[23]\nIn September 2018, Laganja was interviewed[24] by Civilized Magazine about her music video[25] for Look at Me that \u201cslammed\u201d the war on drugs. The interview by Civilized \u2014 a magazine reported to be for the millions of adults who choose to enjoy cannabis recreationally[26] \u2014 covered a number of aspects behind the imagery of Laganja's music video.\nIn December 2018, Laganja was featured in a Facebook live broadcast by Merry Jane. In this episode, Laganja talks fun-and-games topics like sky diving in drag and her favorite cannabis strains. But, she also goes into serious topics like \u201cweed slut-ness\u201d and important cannabis policy news.[citation needed]\nLeafly, the world's largest cannabis information site, featured Laganja on their in-house podcast in January 2019.[27] The podcast, The Hash, explored, alongside Laganja, topics like homophobia in the cannabis industry and what it's like to often be the only queer person in a room.\n\nDance[edit]\nGraduating from The California Institute of the Arts in 2011 with a bachelor of fine arts degree in dance and choreography, Laganja is a skilled choreographer, teacher, and dancer. A Presidential Scholar in The Arts, Laganja performed her original work \u201cnot today\u201d at the Kennedy Center in 2007.[28] Laganja is also a YoungArts Silver Winner[29] and returns every year to the program to mentor high school students in Miami, Florida.\nLaganja's choreography credits include Germany's Next Top Model, NYC Cosmetics FACE Awards, and for commercial artists such as Miley Cyrus and Brooke Candy.[30]\nIn the summer of 2017, Laganja led a dance theatre project on gender expression with artists across Europe assembling in Nottingham, UK for a four-day workshop and showcase exploring the boundaries of gender identity.[31] \u201cG[END]ER\u201d was in collaboration with Backlit Gallery, Kitty Tray, and Nottingham Contemporary. In the fall of 2018, Laganja elaborated on this idea of gender expression with her dance residency at YoungArts.[32] The immersive experience included live vocals, original compositions, and curated set design.\nLaganja's moves have also been featured on several popular dance YouTube channels including, but not limited to, Brian Friedman and DanceON.\nIn the fall of 2018, Laganja found herself partnered with the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami (Pamm)[32] to present the art of drag for a one-day Poplife Social YoungArts Takeover. The event at the world-renowned art museum included an invitation from Laganja herself, \u201cOnto Pamm\u2019s terrace to warm up their dance muscles, \u2018sissy that walk\u2019 across the space and participate in a fan dance inspired by traditional Japanese performance.\u201d\n\nLaganja's Dance School[edit]\nIn 2016 Laganja's Dance School, an international high-heels masterclass and confidence workshop, was founded with partner Kristen Lovell.[33] The master class has been held in dozens of cities in the United States and as an international experience, has traveled to Manchester, Nottingham, London, Newcastle, Dublin, Lima, Mexico City, and Amsterdam.[34][35]\nThe class includes an extensive warmup/stretch, across the floor exercises, and a final combination of original choreography. Participants are encouraged to express themselves, gain new skills, and feel amazing in this hip-hop oriented jazz funk atmosphere.\nLaganja's Dance School is also held weekly at The Basement Center of NoHo in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, and a beginning Heels Technique class is held at Downtown Dance and Movement in Downtown Los Angeles. Dancers and non-dancers are encouraged to participate and push the limits of their bodies. Class is taught at a professional level, but all ages and abilities are welcome.[34]\nIn 2019 the documentary \"Laganja's Dance School\" was released. The documentary was directed by Selene Kapsaski and chronicles Laganja Estranja teaching a dance class in London.[36]\n\nMerchandise[edit]\nIn 2014, Laganja launched a collection of marijuana-themed merchandise including a jewelry line called \"Laganja Estranja Is My Enemy\".[37] Laganja has also collaborated with Blunted Objects on a marijuana-themed statement necklace.[38]\nAs a model/brand ambassador, Laganja embodies the company she endorses and represents by increasing brand awareness with an authentic flair. While she does not have a marketing degree, it is clear that, through her social media skills, Laganja provides the utmost exposure for any partner.\nWith her established online presence of over one million followers collectively,[39] Laganja always provides professional, modern marketing to consumers. Laganja maintains long lasting relationship with many diverse companies as a product and brand ambassador.[40][41][42][43][44][45]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nJackson spoke out against Donald Trump while the latter was running for President of the United States, and is committed to continuing to use their platform for social change.[46] They identify as non-binary and do not have any preferred pronouns.[47]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSingles[edit]\nAs lead artist[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\n\n\"Legs\"[48](featuring Rye Rye)\n\n2015\n\n\n\"Hotbox\"[49]\n\n\n\"Tease 4u\"\n\n2016\n\n\n\"Look at Me\"\n(featuring J.

Fragility, purity, and decay are important subjects in my work. Nature is also a noteworthy aspect of my work as well.\"\n\u00a0\u2014Florian-Ayala Fauna[16]\n\n\nFauna is a multidisciplinary artist whose work has been exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, France, a Coil-themed exhibition in Berlin, Germany, and in the United Kingdom as well as locally in Buffalo, New York.[18][16][3][19][20] Fauna's artwork utilizes collage, film, painting, photography, and poetry.[3][4] Her work includes  occult, psychedelia, chaos and spiritual enlightenment.[21] Animal imagery include deer, foxes, goats, hares, birds, and wolves.[3][12] She cites the Surrealists as an influence.[5][15][17]\n\nMusic[edit]\nuncertain[edit]\nIn 2007, uncertain began as the solo project of Florian-Ayala Fauna.[12][15][17][6][7][8][9] Initially, she made ambient and drone music with the computer programme Ableton.[17] Her first album glass fawn was an ambient soundscape about a deer getting lost.[5] It often involved field recordings, processed sounds, and tape loops while their current cycle (since 2012) features albums about a family of foxes done with composition, sampling, and complex music production on Ableton Live and Kontakt.[5][3][4] Influences include Aleister Crowley, Hermeticism, Arvo P\u00e4rt, Coil, Current 93, Throbbing Gristle, and alchemy.[5][17][6][7][8][9][10][11] As of 2016, Fauna is the main producer and collaborates with others, primarily with Felix Keigh who is her fianc\u00e9 and main vocalist.[4][17][15]\n\nLive performances[edit]\nuncertain started doing live performances in 2013.[17] Cities for live performances have included Boston, Cincinnati, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. However, her chronic fatigue limits touring.[5][15] They use visuals such as the use of animal masks, candles, lights, video projections, and ritualistic costumes.[17] Live shows have included performances alongside TRNSGNDR/VHS.[5]\n\nCollaborations[edit]\nFauna has collaborated with former Coil member Stephen Thrower (Cyclobe, UnicaZ\u00fcrn), Esperik Glare's Charlie Martineau (In Serpents and Seas), and others.[5][14] Thrower contributed an opening track to her 2016 album Dark Night of the Soul.[12] She has also frequently done artwork for Swiss post-industrial musicians and artists Black Sun Productions. Her most recent collaboration was with London-based industrial hip hop artist Ubik MCDXCII, providing production work for the track \"Rites and Ceremonies\" on his album \"Blackout Blinds\".[citation needed]\n\nReception[edit]\nIn February 2013, Orange County, California alternative weekly OC Weekly's Dave Barton called dancing with the blind (lost children) \"atmospheric and haunting\" and \"one of the most evocative titles for an album I've ever heard.\"[3] In August 2016, The Public's Cory Perla described both her art and music as \"otherworldly.\"[4] In March 2017, British music magazine The Quietus's Russell Cuzner summed up her music as \"somehow fulfil[s] a similar aesthetic to the artist's equally prolific visual art that often depict animal heads [...] as if charged with some kind of hidden power, part gothic horror, part Gnostic totem.\"[12] In December 2019, Columbus Alive's Andy Downing said God Is a Man Eater was \"dense, buzzing, six-track song cycle.\"[15]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nFauna supports anti-fascism and identifies as an anarchist.[5][17]\n\nDiscography[edit]\n\n\nTitle\nRelease\nRecord label (Catalogue number)\n\n\n\n\n\nglass fawn\n2009[5] or 11 January 2010[22]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nsmall cold hands\n6 April 2010[24]\nN/A[23]\n\n\namniotic fluid EP\n20 February 2011[25]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1][23]\n\n\nseahorse (abyssopelagic)\n23 February 2011[26]\nN/A[23]\n\n\ngrief: silence in five movements\n23 May 2011[27][28]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1][23] (spar004[1][27])\n\n\n\u00e6ther: musick for moths\n1 January 2012[29][30]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nphoenix rising EP\n1 February 2012[31]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nWarm Leatherette (a cover version of The Normal)\n9 April 2012[32][33]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1][23]\n\n\nvery friendly (a cover version of Throbbing Gristle)\n23 April 2012[34]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1]\n\n\nnocturnal\n1 May 2012[35][36]\nSparrow's Tongue Records[1][23]\n\n\ndancing with the blind (lost children)\n1 January 2013[37][38]\nSparrow's Tongue Records (spar008[38])[3][1][23]\n\n\nphantoms of the trench warfare (past lives in black flames)\n20 March 2013[39]\nSparrow's Tongue Records (spar009[39])[23]\n\n\ncrawling through the abyss (perdurabo)\n23 October 2013[40]\nSparrow's Tongue Records (spar010[40])[23]\n\n\nthe cycle of tears (moon)\n23 September 2014[41]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nuncertain presents \u2021 black-stag's-lament \u2021 - the vision of sorrow ep\n10 December 2014[42]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nHorns and Teeth (Blood Rite)\n16 January 2015[43]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nBlack Forest Invocation (Astaroth) - Live at Black Forest Invocation\n22 February 2015[44]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nThe Fox's Blood Moon (for Ian Johnstone)\n23 July 2015[45]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nThe Price of Existence Is Eternal Warfare (Live Invocations)\n31 October 2015[46]\nWraith Productions (886445526660[46])[23]\n\n\ntransnoise aktion no. 001 - 05.21.2016\n2016\nN/A\n\n\nThe Veins were Licked by the Vulpine Garden\n5 June 2016[47]\nN/A[23]\n\n\ntransnoise aktion no. 003 - 08.04.2016\n2016\nN/A\n\n\ntransnoise aktion no. 004 - 08.26.2016\n2016\nN/A\n\n\nTransnoise Aktion no. 005 - 09.02.2016\n4 September 2016[48]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nThe Crown of the Mother Elk\n26 September 2016[49]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nblack stag's lament\n3 December 2016[50]\nN/A[23]\n\n\ndark night of the soul (the pile of bodies)\n22 December 2016[51]\nN/A[12][23]\n\n\nThe Surgeon Was a Butcher\n5 July 2017[52]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nChild Covered in Needles (She Is Dancing and Blind)\n5 August 2017[53]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nGod Is a Man Eater[15]\n30 October 2019[54]\nN/A[23]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of ambient music artists\nList of androgynous people\nList of dark ambient artists\nList of experimental musicians\nList of noise musicians\nList of people from Buffalo, New York\nList of people from Hampton Roads, Virginia\nList of people from Virginia\nList of people with chronic fatigue syndrome\nList of transgender people\nList of intersex people\nBiography portalArts portalMusic portalLGBT portal\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j \"Florian-Ayala Fauna Discography at Discogs\".

In 2012, Wilson released the EP Reservation and later signed a record deal with Universal Republic Records before moving to Republic Records.[6] On December 31, 2013, Wilson released her debut album Dirty Gold, which featured the singles \"Echelon (It's My Way)\" and \"Battle Cry.\u201d Wilson has released a number of mixtapes, including Reservation, which was ranked the sixth-best mixtape of 2012 by Mike Diver of the BBC,[7] the most recent one Back to the Woods appeared in 2015.[8]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Musical career\n3 Artistry\n\n3.1 Influences\n3.2 Public image\n\n\n4 Personal life\n5 Discography\n6 Filmography\n\n6.1 Television\n\n\n7 Awards and nominations\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nWilson was born in Detroit, Michigan to a military family. Her father, who died from a gunshot wound before her birth, was African American and her mother is Native American Cherokee.[9] When Wilson was a young child her mother met a preacher in the Greater Apostolic Faith and the two moved into his home with his wife and children, into what Wilson describes as a cult.[9] Growing up in the church, Wilson witnessed domestic violence and manipulation at a very young age.[10][11] As a child, she was sexually abused by a man close to the family.[9] Wilson also recalls being told that they would die spontaneously if she did not behave correctly.[9] In an interview with The Guardian, Wilson stated: \"We all lived in the same community, within 10 minutes of each other. You weren't allowed to talk to anyone outside of that, you weren't allowed to wear jewelry, listen to music, to eat certain things, to date people \u2026 you weren't allowed to do pretty much anything.\"[12]\nWilson's family moved around frequently, mainly due to her mother running away from the church.[13] At one point the family was living in a shelter and she was teased at school for it.[14] They were also mocked for her clothes and had difficulties making friends and connections due to moving around. She switched between homeschool and public school for many years and finished high school a year early.[14]\nAfter a pastor threatened Wilson's mother, the family left the church, moving to Brooklyn, New York, when she was 15 years old.[15] The pastor told Haze's family that God was going to kill them, and they lived in fear for years afterward.[11]\nWilson began writing as a form of therapy and expressed an interest in creative writing, poetry and journalism.[16] Her first poem was published at the age of 13 after winning a school competition.[16] As a child, she took creative writing lessons and wanted to be a songwriter or gospel artist.[16] Eventually, she began making YouTube videos and freestyle rapping at the age of 18.[17] Wilson began distributing music on the Internet through sites such as Tumblr, where a fan base began to form.[9]\n\nMusical career[edit]\n Wilson performing live at \u00d8yafestivalen in 2013\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Wilson put out a number of mixtapes for free download on the Internet: New Moon, Altered Ego, King, and Voice. In July 2012, they released the free mixtape Reservation to critical acclaim, receiving an 88/100 score from Metacritic.[18] The title Reservation is an homage to her Native American heritage.[19]  Wilson was nominated for BBC the Sound of 2013 poll.[20]\nIn 2012, Wilson recounted her experience of being sexually assaulted as a child in \"Cleaning Out My Closet,\" a song from the mixtape Classick that uses segments from Eminem's song of the same name.[4]\nOn August 28, 2013, Wilson released \"Echelon (It's My Way)\" as the lead single from the debut album Dirty Gold. The entire album was leaked on December 18, 2013, prior to scheduled March 2014 release.[21] The album release date was advanced, and it appeared through Island Records and Republic Records on December 30, 2013, to positive reviews. It had low first-week sales[22] of just over 500 copies.[23][24] On September 14, 2015, Wilson released the mixtape Back to the Woods announcing that the project was just \"something to share before a sophomore\".[25] In March 2017 Wilson released \"Resurrection\".[26][27]\n\nArtistry[edit]\nInfluences[edit]\nAfter Wilson moved to New York and began listening to secular music, she became inspired by artists such as Eminem, Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Drake and Lil Wayne.[10] \"The artists that I identify [with] mostly are the ones who are so uncompromisingly themselves,\" Wilson said in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview. \"Like, 'Fuck you. I don't care what you think about it. This is who I am. And I can either force-feed you this shit, or you can take it as you will.'\"[15]\n\nPublic image[edit]\nWilson raps about themes such as homophobia, rape culture and racism. She uses her personal experiences to condemn a culture that breeds the self-harm of queer youth.[19] Wilson has also been open about her experience with mental illnesses such as addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anorexia[28] in her music and in interviews and social media.\nWilson sees her goal as an artist to reach out to people who are similar to her or going through difficult experiences.[19] She said, \"It's not about the Bible. It's not about going to church. It's not about anything other than that we are all energies connected with a force that's greater than us. It's an energy that's omniscient, it covers the whole world, and everybody here is created for a reason. Mine happens to be to make the music and inspire the people who are stuck in dark places.\"[29]\nIn a 2014 Vice column, Wilson discussed cultural appropriation and white artists making hip hop. She stated, \"There seems to be this hypocrisy because people want to appropriate black culture but only when it's cool or beneficial to them \u2026 And that's the reason that people don't have a right, to some extent, to use black music to their own gains.\"[30]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nWilson is pansexual and agender.[31] She has said: \"People talking about me, like, 'I'm glad there's an actual woman of color representing queerness and pansexuality, someone who is like me in the spotlight.'\"[32] In 2015, Wilson noted in an interview with BuzzFeed that although she identifies as neither male nor female, she does prefer singular pronouns, explaining, \"I feel like my agenderness and my gender identity have evolved.\"[31] Reading articles about herself, she noted, \"I sound like four people when I get written about as 'they.' It drives me crazy \u2026 I'm one person. So, if you call me 'him' or 'her,' it doesn't matter to me. I don't consider myself of any sex. I consider myself an experience.\"[33]\nIn an interview with The Guardian, Wilson stated that, \"Love is boundary-less. If you can make me feel, if you can make me laugh\u2014and that's hard to do\u2014then I can be with you.\"[3] In 2014, she was in a relationship with model Ireland Baldwin.[34] The two broke up a year later.[35]\nWilson recorded a cover of Macklemore's \"Same Love,\"[36] which chronicled her own personal experiences. She opened up about her struggles with family over sexuality and growing up LGBTQ. In a 2017 Billboard interview she stated, \"When I was young \u2026 I didn't understand what was going on. I didn't understand that I could be attracted to men and women at the same time.\"[29]\nIn 2015, Wilson began working on a body image project titled \"The Naked Eye\" incorporating nude photographs and interviews of people with body dysmorphia.[19] The project aims to create a conversation about conventional and mainstream beauty standards.\nWilson is self-taught in the Cherokee language and celebrates her multiracial heritage.[19]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nMain article: Angel Haze discography\nDirty Gold (2013)\nBack to the Woods (2015)\nFilmography[edit]\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nFilm\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2015\n\nCatfish: The TV Show[37]\n\nCo-host\n\nSeason 4 \u2013 Episode 3\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nOrganization\n\nAward\n\nWork\n\nResult\n\n\n2012\n\nMTV\n\nBrand New For 2013[38]\n\n\u2014\n\nNominated\n\n\nBBC\n\nSound of 2013[20][39]\n\nThird\n\n\n2013\n\nPopdust\n\nNext Pop Superstar of 2013[40]\n\n\u2014\n\nNominated\n\n\nO Music Awards\n\nBest Web-Born Artist[41]\n\n\n2014\n\nBET Awards\n\nBest Female Hip Hop Artist[42]\n\n\nMTV Video Music Awards\n\nBest Video with a Social Message[43]\n\n\"Battle Cry\"\n\n\n2015\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nOutstanding Music Artist\n\n\u2014\n\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT culture in New York City\nList of self-identified LGBTQ New Yorkers\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Azealia Banks and Angel Haze trade shots on Twitter\".

At age 22, Hedva began studying astrophysics at a city college[2] before transferring two years later to UCLA to study design.[3] Graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Design from UCLA in 2010,[4] Hedva earned a Master of Fine Arts at the California Institute of the Arts in 2013, and a Master of Arts in Aesthetics and Politics at the California Institute of the Arts in 2014.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2014, Hedva held an Interdisciplinary Artist in Residence at the Headlands Center for the Arts in California,[6] and a Writer in Residence for Project X Desk at Outpost at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena.[7]\nIn October 2015, Hedva delivered a lecture at the Women\u2019s Center for Creative Work titled, \"My Body Is a Prison of Pain so I Want to Leave It Like a Mystic But I Also Love It & Want it to Matter Politically\".[8][9] The LA Weekly described it as a \"smart, compelling talk... which became the essay 'Sick Woman Theory' \".[10] The essay \"describes her own chronic, confounding illness and the impersonality of the Western medical industry, and suggests that the greatest enemy to capitalism is taking care of yourself and of others\".[10] Sick Woman Theory posed the question, \"How do you throw a brick through the window of a bank if you can't get out of bed?\"[11] Influenced by Ann Cvetkovich's scholarship on depression, Sick Woman Theory takes illness as not a solely biological phenomenon, but a social and cultural one, claiming that \"the body and mind are sensitive and reactive to regimes of oppression,\" and affirming the role of collective historical trauma in producing illness.[12] Lauren Fournier wrote, \"Johanna Hedva articulates an ethos of agency for those living with chronic illness\".[13]\nArtslant Magazine reported:\n\nIn her Sick Woman Theory, writer and performer Johanna Hedva suggests that the dominant discourse on political action, drawing largely as it does from Hannah Arendt\u2019s faith in the political effect of bodies in the street, is too narrow a definition of how we engage the political. Arendt\u2019s conception suggests that only bodies that are able to enter the street are acting politically. It privileges those for whom this is a possibility and reduces other actions to the nonpolitical. Hedva asks us to consider the politics of intimacy, of interdependence, of bodies that need, that engage in relationships and in so doing reshape the social (political) fabrics around them.\u2014\u2009Danyel Ferrari[14]\nDundee Contemporary Arts said:\n\n\"In Defense of De-Persons\" focuses more specifically on the American Psychological Association diagnosis of depersonalization disorder, or depersonalization/derealization syndrome, characterized by \"experiences of unreality or detachment from one's mind, self, or body\".[15]\nIn February 2018, Hedva published \"Letter to A Young Doctor,\" in Triple Canopy's Risk Pool issue. \"A document of emergency,\" an epistolary essay on the terms of engagement between patient and doctor.[16]\nOn 14 February 2018, Sator Press published Hedva's novel On Hell.[17] The book has been praised by  Dennis Cooper, who listed it among his favorite fiction of 2018.[18] Janice Lee wrote, \"Brilliant. Fervent. Unafraid and unapologetic. This text will consume you.\"[19] According to Hedva, \"On Hell is my attempt at a 21st-century version of Icarus, from a crip perspective.\"[20]\n\nPerformances[edit]\nFrom 2012-2015, Hedva wrote and directed a series of plays and performances titled The Greek Cycle. These plays are adaptations of ancient Greek texts which have been rewritten to include feminist and queer concerns in contemporary discourses, like Hedva's adaptation of Medea, with the role of Medea rewritten to be performed by and as a genderfluid, queer person of color in exile.[21] Most take place in unusual locations; for instance, Odyssey Odyssey, an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey, was performed in a Honda Odyssey minivan being driven by a performer.[22]\nIn April 2019, Hedva performed Black Moon Lilith in Pisces in the 4th House, a solo of guitar and voice, as part of the disability festival I Wanna Be With You Everywhere[23] at Performance Space New York. They also performed this as part of No End and No Beginning[24] in January 2020 at Wellcome Collection, London. \nHyperallergic said:\n\n\"Johanna Hedva also ghosted after building a droning crescendo in the finale of \u201cBlack Moon Lilith in Pisces in the 4th House,\u201d leaving the audience in the collective discomfort of loud sound and powerful vibration. Their music was an alchemical transmutation of chronic pain, trauma, and death.[25]\nProcessing Foundation[edit]\nSince 2014, Hedva has served as the Director of Advocacy for the Processing Foundation,[26] an auxiliary operation to the Processing open source computer programming project with the goal \"to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\"[27] Hedva joined the project based on their political activism, and their commitment to \"open-source philosophy and practice, decolonial politics and action, and to promoting the attenuation of the boundaries between creative disciplines of all kinds\"[26] During a talk at a Processing conference on diversity, Hedva spoke about their goals for the Processing Foundation as \"an institution defined by having to constantly re-institute itself,\" characterized by continuous growth and criticality.[28] In their role with the foundation, Hedva helped establish a fellowship program in 2015, which focuses on issues of access to Processing software across society. Speaking on the program, Hedva states that \"technology can be both a viable artistic medium as well as a model for sociality,\" where tools are learned and developed through exploration and collaboration.[29]\n\nAwards[edit]\nThey were selected for the 2010 Best Work (Senior), Undergraduate Exhibition Award at UCLA as well as the Marion Lucy Queal Scholarship and the 2013 CalArts Dean's Project Award and Interdisciplinary Grant.[30]\n\nSelected works[edit]\n\"Everything Is Erotic Therefore Everything Is Exhausting\", Two Serious Ladies, 2015.[31]\n\"Euripides Is Not a Genius.

His family name is of French Huguenot origin.[6] His mother was a midwife and nurse; his father was an accountant who was working in Aden with British Petroleum at the time of Izzard's birth.[7][8] When Izzard was one year old, the family moved to Northern Ireland, settling in Bangor, County Down, where they lived until Izzard was five.[4][5][7][9] The family then moved to Wales, where they lived in Skewen. Izzard's mother died of cancer when Izzard was six and his brother, Mark, was eight.[4][8][10] He and his brother built a model railway to occupy their time while their mother was ill (it was donated to Bexhill Museum in 2016).[11] Following his mother's death, Izzard attended [4][8] St John's School in Porthcawl, Mid Glamorgan,[12] St Bede's Prep School[13] and Eastbourne College.[14] He has said that he knew he was a transgender person[15] at the age of four, after watching another boy being forced to wear a dress by his sisters, and that he knew at the age of seven that he wanted to be an actor.[16]\n\nCareer[edit]\nComedy[edit]\n Elliott Gould and Izzard in 2006\n Izzard in 2008\nIzzard began to toy with comedy at the University of Sheffield with student friend Rob Ballard.[17][18] After leaving his accountancy degree, he and Ballard took their act to the streets,[17][18] often in Covent Garden.[12][19][20] After splitting with Ballard, Izzard spent a great deal of the early 1980s working as a street performer in Europe and the United States. Izzard says that he developed his comedic voice by talking to his audience while doing solo escape acts.[21] He then moved his act to the stand-up comedy venues of Britain. His first gig was at the Banana Cabaret in Balham, London.[4][22]\nIn 1987, Izzard made his first stage appearance at the Comedy Store in London.[9] He refined his material throughout the 1980s, and in the early 1990s began earning recognition through his improvisation, in part at his own club, \"Raging Bull\" in Soho.[20]\nIzzard's big break came in 1991 when he performed his \"Raised by Wolves\" sketch on the televised \"Hysteria 3\" AIDS benefit.[23]\nIzzard speaks French and has performed stand-up shows in the language; from 2014 he began to perform in German, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic,[24] languages that he did not previously speak.[25]\n\nTheatrical, television and film appearances[edit]\n Izzard at the 2013 British Academy Awards\nIn 1994, Izzard made his West End drama debut as the lead in the world premiere of David Mamet's The Cryptogram with Lindsay Duncan, in the production at London's Comedy Theatre. The success of that role led to his second starring role, in David Beaird's black comedy 900 Oneonta. In 1995, he portrayed the title character in Christopher Marlowe's Edward II.[26]\nIn 1998, Izzard appeared briefly on stage with Monty Python in The American Film Institute's Tribute to Monty Python (also referred to as Monty Python Live at Aspen). As part of an inside joke, he walked on stage with the five surviving Pythons and he was summarily escorted off by Eric Idle and Michael Palin as he attempted to participate in a discussion about how the group got together.[27] In July 2014, Izzard appeared on stage with Monty Python during their live show Monty Python Live (Mostly) as the special guest in their \"Blackmail\" sketch.[28]\nIzzard has appeared in a number of episodes of BBC One's Have I Got News For You. He portrayed comedian Lenny Bruce in the 1999 production of Julian Barry's 1971 play Lenny. In 2001, he replaced Clive Owen in Peter Nichols' 1967 play A Day in the Death of Joe Egg at the Comedy Theatre. Izzard and Victoria Hamilton repeated their lead roles when the show was brought to Broadway in 2003 in the Roundabout Theatre Company production. The revival received four Tony Award nominations, including Best Revival of a Play, Best Leading Actor, and Best Leading Actress for its stars Izzard and Hamilton in their Broadway debuts, and Best Direction for Laurence Boswell. In June 2010, Izzard replaced James Spader in the role of Jack Lawson in David Mamet's play Race on Broadway.[29]\nIzzard has appeared in numerous films, starting with 1996's The Secret Agent. He has appeared as several real-life individuals, including Charlie Chaplin in The Cat's Meow, actor Gustav von Wangenheim in Shadow of the Vampire, and General Erich Fellgiebel in Valkyrie. Other roles have included Mr Kite in Across the Universe, Lussurioso in Revengers Tragedy and criminal expert Roman Nagel in Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen. Izzard's voice work has included the titular \"It\" in Five Children and It, Nigel in The Wild and the mouse warrior Reepicheep in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. He declined to reprise his role as Reepicheep, a role understudied by Simon Pegg in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. He has stated that he felt he learned to act while working on the film Circus.[30]\nIzzard appeared in the 2009 BBC science fiction miniseries The Day of the Triffids, based on the 1951 novel, alongside Jason Priestley, Vanessa Redgrave, Joely Richardson, Dougray Scott and Brian Cox.[31]\nHe presented the medals to the athletes who had won the 800m T54 race at the London 2012 Paralympic Games, including gold medalist David Weir.[32] He played Dr. Hatteras, a skeptical psychology professor, in the Showtime series United States of Tara[33] and appeared in six episodes of the 2013\u201315 American psychological horror television series Hannibal as Dr. Abel Gideon.[34]\nIn 2014, he played the part of Robert Watson-Watt, in the BBC drama film Castles in the Sky, who invented aircraft-detecting radar equipment in time for the Battle of Britain.\nIn June 2017, Izzard read excerpts from his autobiography Believe Me for BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week.[35] He appeared as a guest on The Daily Show in May 2019 and discussed his current activities as a comic, his political aspirations, and his ongoing efforts as an avid marathon runner.[36]\n\nComic style[edit]\nIzzard uses a stream-of-consciousness delivery that jumps among topics. As he put it in a 2004 interview with The Guardian, \"It's the oral tradition. Human beings have been doing it for thousands of years\".[37] His bent towards the surreal went so far as to produce a sitcom called Cows in 1997 for Channel 4, a live action comedy with actors dressed in cow suits.[38] Izzard has cited Monty Python as his biggest influence, and Python's John Cleese once referred to him as \"the lost Python\".[9]\n\nPolitical views and activism[edit]\nIzzard is a staunch pro-European Union campaigner, supporting the further integration of the UK into the EU. In May 2005, he appeared on the BBC's political debate show Question Time, describing himself as a \"British-European\", comparing this with other cultural identities such as \"African-American\". As part of his integration campaigning, he was one of the first people to spend a euro in London. This pan-European approach has influenced his work; he regularly performs in French[19][33] and occasionally in German.[20] On 16 June 2017, on the \"Overtime\" segment of HBO political talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, Izzard claimed to be working in four languages: Spanish, German, French and English.\nIn July 2003, Izzard received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of East Anglia, Norwich, for \"pro-Europe campaigning\", \"his contribution to promoting modern languages and tolerance of other cultures and lifestyles\", and for having \"transcended national barriers\" with his humour.[39] He has also campaigned unsuccessfully against the closure of the departments of Drama and Languages, Linguistics and Translation at the University of East Anglia, although the department of Drama was later reprieved.[40]\nIn 1998, Izzard was named on a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party.[41] He appeared in a party political broadcast for the Labour Party in the run-up to the 2005 general election. He donated nearly \u00a310,000 to the party in 2008,[42] appeared again on a party political broadcast for the 2009 European election, and again in a 2010 election video entitled Brilliant Britain. Izzard appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote for electing Members of Parliament to the House of Commons in the Alternative Vote referendum in 2011[43] and is a supporter of the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform. On 25 February 2016, Izzard announced his intention to stand for the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.[44] It was announced on 9 August 2016 that Izzard had failed to be elected to the NEC.[45]\nOn 20 July 2006, Izzard received an honorary doctorate in Letters from the Faculty of Arts at the University of Sheffield,[46] where he had spent a year on an Accounting and Financial Management course in the early 1980s. During his time at the university he established the now-defunct Alternative Productions Society in the Union of Students with the aim of promoting fringe-based arts. On 4 March 2010, he was elected Honorary President of the University of Sheffield Students' Union.[47]\nOn 7 July 2007, Izzard was a presenter from the London Leg of Live Earth. During an interview for the 2008 Stripped tour, he spoke about becoming more active in European politics as well as running for political office in Europe within the next decade. Izzard added a stop in New Orleans during his 2008 Stripped tour. All proceeds from the performance of 23 June 2008 were donated to Neighborhood Housing Services of New Orleans.[48]\nIn March 2014, Izzard began leading a campaign encouraging Scottish people not to vote for independence in the September referendum, saying that England would feel a \"deep sense of loss\" if Scotland were to leave the UK.[49]\nIn September 2011, he declared his ambition to stand for the party as an MP, MEP, or Mayor of London,[50] announcing his intention to stand for the London mayoral election in 2020.[51][52] When asked on comedy panel show The Last Leg why he thought he might be elected, he replied \"Boris Johnson\".[53] He is also a republican, believing that Britain should have a democratically elected head of state.[54] He has stated that he is a social democrat, not a socialist.[55] Izzard confirmed his support for Labour in the 2015 general election, attending a party rally with fellow comedian Ben Elton and actress Sally Lindsay in April 2015.[56]\nOn 27 July 2009, with only 5 weeks' training and no significant prior running experience, Izzard began seven weeks of back-to-back marathon runs (with Sundays off) across the UK to raise money for Sport Relief. He ran from London to Cardiff to Belfast to Edinburgh and back to London, carrying the flag of the country\u2014England, Scotland, or Wales\u2014in which he was running. In Northern Ireland, he carried a self-designed green flag bearing a white dove. The blog Eddie Iz Running documented his 43 marathons in 51 days, covering at least 27 miles per day (totalling more than 1,100 miles), ending on 15 September 2009.[57]  He received a special award at BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2009 for his achievements.[58] In March 2010, Izzard took part in the Sport Relief Mile event.[59]\nOn 16 February 2016 the BBC announced that Izzard would attempt to run 27 marathons in 27 days through South Africa for Sport Relief.[60] The significance of the number 27 came from the number of years Nelson Mandela was held in prison. In total, Izzard would aim to run more than 700 miles in temperatures of up to 40\u00a0\u00b0C. He had attempted such a project in South Africa in 2012, but withdrew due to health concerns.[61] Izzard completed his first marathon on 23 February 2016. He completed the marathon challenge on 20 March 2016 at the statue of Mandela in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Because he had spent a day in hospital, he had to run two consecutive marathons on this last day. He raised more than \u00a31.35M for Sport Relief.[62] A BBC documentary detailing his feat was broadcast on 28 March.[63]\nIn May 2017, Izzard declared his intention to become a Labour politician after endorsing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He said: \"I like Jeremy Corbyn. He believes in what he says.\"[64] In October, he announced a renewed bid for election to Labour's National Executive Committee.[65] In January 2018, it was announced that Izzard had failed in his second bid to be elected to the NEC.[66] On 31 March 2018, Christine Shawcroft resigned from the Labour Party's NEC. Izzard replaced her and served until the next NEC election, held in summer 2018.[67] Izzard came ninth in that election, and so was not re-elected to the NEC.[68]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIzzard resides in Victoria, London.[69]\nDuring his 2008 Stripped tour, Izzard said he realised he was an atheist. He said, \"I was warming the material up in New York, where one night, literally on stage, I realised I didn't believe in God at all. I just didn't think there was anyone upstairs.\"[70] He has since described himself as a spiritual atheist, saying, \"I don't believe in the guy upstairs, I believe in us.\"[71]\nIzzard keeps his romantic life private, citing the wishes of his companions not wanting to become content for his show.[70] He dated Sarah Townsend, who later directed the documentary Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story,[19] and whom he first met while she was running a Fringe venue at the Edinburgh Festival in 1989.[72]\nIzzard supports Crystal Palace F.C. and became an associate director at the club on 16 July 2012.[73]\nIzzard is genderfluid[74] and calls himself \"somewhat boy-ish and somewhat girl-ish\".[15] He uses transgender as an umbrella term.[75] When asked what pronouns he prefers, Izzard said \"either 'he' or 'she.'\"[76] In the past, Izzard identified as a transvestite, and he has also called himself \"a lesbian trapped in a man's body\"[77] and \"a complete boy plus half girl\".[78] Izzard started to publicly identify as transvestite in venues such as the Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992.[79][80] His stance is that the way he dresses is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish. He said \"I don't call it drag; I don't even call it cross-dressing. It's just wearing a dress. ... It's not about artifice. It's about me just expressing myself.\"[81] He remarks in his show Unrepeatable that \"women wear what they want and so do I\". He has expressed a personal conviction that being transgender is caused by genetics and that someday this will be scientifically proven, having gone so far as to have his own genome sequenced.[82]\n\nHonours[edit]\nOn 18 March 2007, Izzard was listed as number 3 of the 100 Greatest British National Comedians (behind Peter Kay at number 2 and Billy Connolly at number 1) as part of British television station Channel 4's ongoing 100 Greatest\u00a0... series. In the 2010 updated version of the list he was ranked 5th.[83]\nIn 2003, he received an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of East Anglia (UEA)[84] and later went on to perform as part of the University's 50th Anniversary celebrations.[85]\nIn 2012, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Sunderland.[86]\nOn 20 February 2013, Izzard received the 6th Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism,[87][88] which is presented at Harvard University each year by the Humanist Community at Harvard,[89] the American Humanist Association, and the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics.\nIn 2015, Izzard was chosen, by readers of The Guardian as their 2014 public language champion. The award was announced at the Guardian and British Academy 2014 Schools Language Awards as part of the annual Language Festival.[90]\nOn 20 November 2018 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by York St John University.[91]\n\nBooks[edit]\nBelieve Me: A Memoir of Love, Death and Jazz Chickens (2017), Michael Joseph, ISBN\u00a0978-0718181727.[92]\nDiscography[edit]\n\n\nDate\n\nTitle\n\n\n15 November 1993\nLive at the Ambassadors\n\n\n14 March 1994\nUnrepeatable\n\n\n21 October 1996\nDefinite Article\n\n\n17 November 1997\nGlorious\n\n\n9 November 1998\nDress to Kill\n\n\n18 November 2002\nCircle\n\n\n26 November 2003\nSexie\n\n\n23 November 2009\nStripped\n\n\n15 January 2011\nLive at Madison Square Garden[93]\n\n\n18 November 2013\nForce Majeure\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1995\nThe Oncoming Storm\nLuthor Keeton\n\n\n\n1996\nThe Secret Agent\nVladimir\n\n\n\n1998\nVelvet Goldmine\nJerry Devine\n\n\n\n1998\nThe Avengers\nBailey\n\n\n\n1999\nMystery Men\nTony P\n\n\n\n1999\nThe Criminal\nPeter Hume\n\n\n\n2000\nCircus\nTroy\n\n\n\n2000\nShadow of the Vampire\nGustav von Wangenheim\n\n\n\n2001\nThe Cat's Meow\nCharlie Chaplin\n\n\n\n2001\nAll the Queen's Men\nTony Parker\n\n\n\n2002\nRevengers Tragedy\nLussurioso\n\n\n\n2003\nAlien Invasion\nBrik\n\n\n\n2004\nBlueberry\nProsit\n\n\n\n2004\nFive Children and It\nIt (voice)\n\n\n\n2004\nRomance & Cigarettes\nGene Vincent\n\n\n\n2004\nOcean's Twelve\nRoman Nagel\n\n\n\n2005\nThe Aristocrats\nHimself\nDocumentary\n\n\n2006\nThe Wild\nNigel(voice)\n\n\n\n2006\nMy Super Ex-Girlfriend\nProfessor Bedlam\n\n\n\n2007\nOcean's Thirteen\nRoman Nagel\n\n\n\n2007\nAcross the Universe\nMr. Kite\n\n\n\n2008\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\nReepicheep(voice)\n\n\n\n2008\nIgor\nDr. Schadenfreude(voice)\n\n\n\n2008\nValkyrie\nErich Fellgiebel\n\n\n\n2009\nRage\nTiny Diamonds\n\n\n\n2009\nBelieve: The Eddie Izzard Story\nHimself\nDocumentary\n\n\n2010\nEvery Day\nGarrett\n\n\n\n2011\nThe Other Side\nDean Bellamy\n\n\n\n2011\nCars 2\nSir Miles Axlerod(voice)\n\n\n\n2011\nLost Christmas\nAnthony\nAlso executive producer\n\n\n2014\nBoychoir\nDrake\n\n\n\n2015\nAbsolutely Anything\nHeadmaster\n\n\n\n2015\nDay Out of Days\nDag\n\n\n\n2016\nWhisky Galore!\nCaptain Wagget\n\n\n\n2016\nRock Dog\nAngus Scattergood(voice)\n\n\n\n2017\nThe Lego Batman Movie\nVoldemort(voice)\n\n\n\n2017\nVictoria & Abdul\nBertie, Prince of Wales\n\n\n\n2019\nAbominable\nBurnish(voice)\n\n\n\n2020\nThe High Note\nDan Deakins\n\n\n\n2020\nGet Duked!\nThe Duke\n\n\n\n2020\nSix Minutes to Midnight\nThomas Miller\nalso writer and executive producer\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1991\nBarf Bites Back\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n1994\nOpen Fire\nRich\nTelevision film\n\n\n1995\nAristophanes: The Gods are Laughing\nSocrates\nTelevision film\n\n\n1996\nTales from the Crypt\nEvans\nEpisode: \"Confession\"\n\n\n1998\nRex the Runt\nMelting Blob Man / Easter Island Head Aliens (voices)\n2 episodes\n\n\n1999\nPython Night \u2013 30 Years of Monty Python\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2002\nMongrel Nation\nHimself\nTelevision documentary\n\n\n2002\nA Day in the Death of Joe Egg\nBri\nTelevision film\n\n\n2003\n40\nRalph Outen\n3 episodes\n\n\n2006\nThe Secret Policeman's Ball\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2007\nKitchen\nNick Malone\n2-part series\n\n\n2007\u20132008\nThe Riches\nWayne Malloy / Doug Rich\n20 episodes\n\n\n2008\nThe Secret Policeman's Ball\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2009\nThe Day of the Triffids\nTorrence\n2 episodes\n\n\n2010\nEddie Izzard: Marathon Man\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2010\nThe Simpsons\nNigel Bakerbutcher / Elizabeth II / Prince Charles (voices)\nEpisode: \"To Surveil with Love\"\n\n\n2011\nUnited States of Tara\nDr. Hattarras\n8 episodes\n\n\n2011\nThe Good Wife\nJames Thrush\nEpisode: \"The Death Zone\"\n\n\n2012\nThe Secret Policeman's Ball\nHimself\nTelevision special\n\n\n2012\nTreasure Island\nLong John Silver\nTelevision miniseries\n\n\n2012\nBullet in the Face\nJohann Tannh\u00e4user\n6 episodes\n\n\n2012\nMockingbird Lane\nGrandpa\nTelevision film\n\n\n2013\nMeet the Izzards\nHimself\nTwo episode documentary\n\n\n2013\u20132015\nHannibal\nDr. Abel Gideon\n6 episodes\n\n\n2014\nCastles in the Sky\nRobert Watson-Watt\nTelevision film\n\n\n2015\nPowers\n\"Big Bad\" Wolfe\n10 episodes\n\n\n2015\nThe Devil You Know\nThomas Putnam\nPilot\n\n\n2016\nThe Big Fat Quiz of Everything\nHimself\n1 episode\n\n\n2018\nTravel Man\nHimself\nEpisode: \"48 Hours in Ljubljana\"\n\n\n2019\nThe Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\nCadia (voice)\nNetflix series\n\n\n2019\nGreen Eggs and Ham\nHervnick Z.

I want to surge positive energy in your body, confirm that you too can be yourself.\"[1]  They said they have been affirmed by strangers telling them that they were glad they are alive, and believe that they were put on the earth \"to be a bodhisattva, to just glow, emanate love, respect, peace, pizzazz\".[4]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r Trebay, Guy. \"A Cover Girl Who's Simply Himself.\" The New York Times (November 25, 2007).\n\n^ a b Bruce Weber, photographer. \"Love Me or Leave Me.\" French Vogue (November 2007).\n\n^ Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, photographers. \"The Alphabulous.\" Archived December 13, 2007, at the Wayback Machine V (September/October 2006)\n\n^ a b c Larocca, Amy. \"Look Book: Cheerful Muse Andre J.\" New York Magazine (March 4, 2007).\n\n^ Trebay, Guy (2007-11-25). \"A Cover Girl Who's Simply Himself\".

Assigned to security duty for Warren Christopher (then Secretary of State) during the United Nations conferences in 1993, Kroc was later assigned to the security force at the presidential retreat at Camp David from 1994 to 1995.\n\nPowerlifting[edit]\nKroc began entering powerlifting contests after joining the Marines in 1991.[14]\nIn 2002, she graduated from college and bought a home prior to the 2002 USAPL Nationals. Later, she went to London, Ohio, to train at a compound with Dave Tate and Jim Wendler.[15] Kroc also trained with Mountain Dog John Meadows,[16] Branch Warren,[17] and Johnnie O. Jackson.[18]\nKroc developed what she called \"kroc rows\", or dumbbell rows performed with extremely heavy weight and many repetitions.[19] She made a video showing 25 repetitions with 225\u00a0pounds,[20] and has been known to perform kroc rows with 300-pound dumbbells.[21] She also described lifting 300 pounds for 13 repetitions using straps; and both 205 pounds for 30 repetitions, and 175 pounds for 40 repetitions, neither with straps.[22] The 300x13 claim was verified at the 2010 Arnold Sports Festival.[23]\nIn 2017, after 18 months on estrogen, Kroc's performance was reduced to 210 pounds for 10 repetitions[24] and deadlifting 605 pounds.[25]\nKroc is a world champion, a world record holding powerlifter, and a National Physique Committee bodybuilder.\n\nSeminar speaking[edit]\nIn 2012, Kroc spoke at Learn To Train Seminar 4. Kroc then shared this online from December 2012 to March 2013.[26]\n\nOther[edit]\nKroc graduated from Ferris State University in 2002 and is a registered pharmacist working in the specialty pharmacy division of Walgreens. Kroc had careers as a sponsored athlete under contract with both EliteFTS and MuscleTech, and as an author and model, having appeared in and published articles in many magazines including Men's Fitness, Powerlifting USA, MuscleMag, and Muscle & Fitness. Kroc is also a featured author for T-Nation. She joined YouTube in 2006.[27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn interviews, Kroc has described growing up in a trailer in a rural conservative area.[7] Kroc started working out with cement-filled Sears weights at 6 years old, including doing 100 reps on a 10-pound dumbbell, and at 8 years old constructed a weight bench out of a 2x4 or 2x12[28] on cement blocks and made a barbell out of milk jugs filled with sand hung on a stick. Kroc weighed 118 pounds as a high school freshman, and, after graduating from high school at Standish-Sterling Central.\nIn 2004, Kroc was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Kroc had three children with a woman named Patty; they split up in 2006. Kroc also married a woman named Lauren.[29]\nKroc says she was the \"Manliest of the Manly Men\",[7] known as an \"Ultimate Alpha Male\"[7] before transitioning. Kroc came out as transgender to friends and relatives (including three sons[7]) around 2005.[7] In April 2015, Kroc legally changed forenames from Matthew Raymond to Janae Marie, a name chosen by Kroc's mother.[1] In July of that year, Kroc came out as both transgender and genderfluid. She is living as both genders,[30] saying she often feels like two completely different people trying to share a body, fighting for control.[31] Kroc goes by female pronouns,[13][32] but uses male pronouns when referring to her life as Matt.[33] In December 2015, Kroc's was the first featured among the top 63 most powerful comings-out of 2015.[34]\nPeople described an Instagram post where Kroc described undergoing facial feminization surgery more than one year before she publicly came out.[35] Earlier articles[36][37][38][39] state similarly. After an August interview by Dave Palumbo,[40] in September Kroc announced the start of a full gender transition, starting both surgical and hormone treatments, and stopping career lifting.[41] In an interview from October 2015, Janae mentioned being four weeks into estrogen therapy and taking a testosterone blocker.[42] That same month, Kroc was mentioned on the cover of Muscle and Fitness[43] which featured an interview[9] and a photo shoot.[8] Kroc was formerly on the advisory board for the magazine. This was the longest (highest word-count) story published to date in Muscle & Fitness, and the first to feature a transgender athlete.[44] A 2017 facial feminization surgery was delayed due to an infection from a cat bite.[45]\nKroc is the subject of the 2017 documentary film Transformer.[46]\n\nAwards[edit]\n2006 Arnold Classic WPO Powerlifting Middle Weight Champion\n2009 All-Time World Record setter in the 220lb class (surpassed in 2010)\nSee also[edit]\nCaitlyn Marie Jenner, another transgender athlete.\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Tuthill, Matt (October 6, 2015). \"Transgender Powerlifter Janae Marie Kroc Shares Unbelievable Story\".

I learned so much from Jiz not just about labor practices in the porn industry, but also about my own academic standards and expectations, and how I can do better.\"[62][63][61] Lee has written on feminism and porn, as well as lectured and published on the subjects of education regarding how trans and queer individuals are represented in trans porn.[64][65]\nLee is known as an advocate of sex workers' rights, and self-describes as a \"pleasure activist\".[66] They run the philanthropic porn experiment Karma Pervs, which seeks to raise funds for sex workers' causes.[67][21][25] Lee used their website to raise funds annually for non-profit organizations with missions helping communities involved in queer, trans, kink, and advocacy for sex workers.[33] Lee's article, \"'Ethical Porn' Starts When We Pay for It\", advocated for labor rights for sex workers.[68][69] Lee was critical of the company MindGeek for propagating pirated content.[70] Lee elaborated on their views to Lola Davina in the book Thriving in Sex Work, commenting online piracy of porn is a form of nonconsent.[71] Jiz Lee is a significant figure in the genre of queer pornography,[7] and is considered to be a visible genderqueer person in porn.[58][72] They are considered a significant contributor to feminist pornography and women's pornography.[73] Lee does not use the term \"[feminist porn\", and has stated that the term implies that porn cannot be inherently feminist.[74][75] Lee defined queer pornography as a style of erotic movie involving either individuals of varied sexual orientations or genders included in the same body of work.[76]\nLee's growing popularity may be attributed in part to the growing quantity of production of feminist pornography and queer pornography.[77][78] These genres of porn have grown significantly in marketing and consumption in the 21st century.[77][7][58] Lee has been interviewed in multiple articles on feminist, queer, and trans issues, especially on queer pornography.[79][74] They attended the first Feminist Porn Conference in Toronto, Canada as a featured speaker.[80] Lee gave lectures at academic facilities including UC Berkeley, Williams College, and Stanford University on queer experiences and sexual identity.[81][15][82] Lee was a featured panelist in Germany on \"Porn Meets Academia\" at the Porn Film Festival Berlin in 2019, and spoke along with scholar Madita Oeming about the inherent difficulties of sexology and the study of porn from an academic perspective.[83][84] The 2020 book Undoing the Gender Binary published by Cambridge University Press called Lee a \"trailblazer for non-binary people's visibility.\"[1]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nCeremony\n\nCategory\n\nWork\n\nResult\n\nNotes\n\n\n2010\n\nAVN Award\n\nBest New Web Starlet\n\nN/A\n\nNominated\n\n[7][85]\n\n\nFeminist Porn Award\n\nThe Boundary Breaker\n\nN/A\n\nWon\n\n[3][21][86]\n\n\n2012\n\nAVN Award\n\nBest All-Girl Group Sex Scene\n\nTaxi 2 (shared with Madison Young and Nic Switch)\n\nNominated\n\n[87]\n\n\nBest Girl/Girl Sex Scene\n\nCherry 2 (shared with Andy San Dimas)\n\nNominated\n\n[87]\n\n\nFeminist Porn Award\n\nOrgasmic Original Concept\n\nMommy is Coming (performer, with Judy Minx, Lil Harlow, Maggie Tapert, Ocean, Papi Coxx, Sadie Lune, Stefan Kuschner, Wieland Speck.)\n\nWon\n\n[88]\n\n\nMost Deliciously Diverse Cast\n\nFuckstyles of the Queer and Famous (performer, with April Flores, Arabelle Raphael, James Darling, Jolene Parton, Maggie Mayhem, Max Wellander, Maya Mayhem, Ned Mayhem, Papi Coxx, Tobi Hill-Meyer, Varina Adams, Wolf Hudson.)\n\nWon\n\n[89]\n\n\n2013\n\nFeminist Porn Award\n\nHeartthrob of the Year\n\nN/A\n\nWon\n\n[90][4][91]\n\n\nSexiest Short\n\nBiodildo (performer, with Garnellen)\n\nWon\n\n[92]\n\n\nSmutty Schoolteacher Award for Sex Education\n\nThe Expert Guide to Pegging: Strap-on Anal Sex for Couples (performer, with Christian Dylan Ryan, Jada Fire, Mickey Mod, Wolf Hudson.)\n\nWon\n\n[93]\n\n\n2014\n\nAVN Award\n\nBest Safe Sex Scene\n\nGirl/Boy (shared with Manuel Ferrara)\n\nNominated\n\n[94]\n\n\nXBIZ Award\n\nBest Scene -

Classic FM has showcased their work and research on travesti roles, while BBC Radio 4's Front Row has included their work with Silent Opera.[6] They have cited Lou Reed and Tchaikovsky as amongst their earliest influences, aged 3\u20134.[7]\nAs a child, Lester began learning to play the piano at age 6, and received vocal coaching from age 13. They went on to obtain a Bachelor of Music from King's College London and a Master of Music from Goldsmiths.[8]\nFor their two most recent albums, Dark Angels and Aether, Lester paid for the recording and production using crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. The albums raised US$3414 and \u00a34575 respectively.[9][10]\nIn addition to performing live and recording music, Lester works as a teacher and an author.[7] Their debut opera, The Lion-Faced Man, appeared at T\u00eate \u00e0 T\u00eate: The Opera Festival in August 2015, including a libretto by Hel Gurney and sung by Alison Wells.[11][12] Their first book, Trans Like Me: A Journey For All Of Us is scheduled to be published by Virago Press in May 2017.[13][14][needs update]\n\nDiscography[edit]\n\nResurrection Men[15][16]\n\nReleased:       2009\nFormat:         MP3\nLabel:          Southbank\nTracks: \"Playback\", \"Brackets\", \"Wayfaring Stranger\"\n\n\nAshes[15][17]\n\nReleased:       2012\nFormat:         MP3 and CD\nWriter:         CN Lester[7]\nTracks: \"Ashes\", \"Tongue\", \"Shiver\", \"Fractals\", \"Fever\", \"Disappear\", \"Lullaby\", \"Joan of Arc\"\n\n\nDark Angels[15][18] (with Toby Carr)\n\nReleased:       2012/2013\nFormat:         MP3 and CD\nWriters:        Benjamin Britten, Peter Maxwell Davies, Jonathan Kulp, Philip Lawton[7][9][19]\nTracks: \"Songs from the Chinese, Op. 58: II.

I can't get chorus work because I wouldn't be willing to wear female clothes or be a member of a women's chorus.\u00a0... They didn't see that they were in the wrong\u00a0\u2013 they thought I was wrong for daring to apply. So it was very much \"We don't want people like that associated with us\" and they were happy to put it down in writing.[23]\nTo preserve their singing voice, Lester has not used testosterone treatments, although they have since spoken about their own research showing losing a singing voice is not always a result of such therapy.[24][25]\n\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT portalTransgender portalRock music portalOpera portalClassical music portalBiography portal\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Reuben, Matthew (17 January 2013). \"Trans role models: Janet Mock, Paris Lees, CN Lester and Luke Anderson\".

She acted in plays such as The Convention and Royal Flush.[5][6] Lone Star/Laundry & Bourbon was the first production by OKRA Theatre, a theater company started by Mantle and her friend Tracy Parks, who directed the play.[7][8]\nIn 1998, Mantle starred in the Chicago production of Charles Busch's play Vampire Lesbians of Sodom.[9] After two years of living in Chicago, she moved to Los Angeles.[7] She later auditioned for the Los Angeles production of Vampire Lesbians of Sodom, where she was scouted and signed by a talent agent.[10]\nIn Los Angeles, Mantle became a member of the band Sex with Lurch, which was formed by singer Robbie Quinne and guitarist Bernard Yin. As part of the group, Mantle used the stage name \"Brandy Warhol\". The group disbanded in December 2002. Mantle later joined Quinne's follow-up band, the Barbarellatones.[7][11]\nMantle was also a member of the band Tranzkuntinental. The band was started by Charlie Paulson and Xander Smith and features drag queens Detox, Rhea Litr\u00e9, Vicky Vox, and Willam Belli.[12][13]\nCurrently, Mantle is a member of the band the Rollz Royces with Tammie Brown and Michael Catti. Mantle and Catti have appeared in Tammie Brown's Christmas show Holiday Sparkle at Fubar in West Hollywood.[14]\nIn 2014 Mantle starred in Confessions of a Womanizer with Gary Busey. The film was released in 2016. Mantle, who is genderfluid, made history when the film's producers sought both supporting actor and supporting actress consideration for her performance and The Academy granted the request.[15]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race[edit]\nIn December 2013, Logo announced that Mantle was among fourteen drag queens who would be competing on the sixth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[16] She was eliminated in the first episode, lip-synching to Express Yourself against Vivacious.[17]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nAlbums[edit]\nEver Changing (2002)\nRock-N-Glow (2004)\nSatellite Baby (2006)\nSingles[edit]\n\n\nSong\n\nYear\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\"My Neck, My Back (Lick It)\"\n\n2013\n\nNon-album single\n\n\n\"Main Event\"\n\n2014\n\nRuPaul Presents: The Covergurlz\n\n\n\"Eliminated\" (featuring Bownce and Wendy Ho)\n\nNon-album single\n\n\n\"Keyboard Courage\"\n\n2015\n\nNon-album single\n\nMusic videos[edit]\n\n\nSong\n\nYear\n\nDirector\n\n\n\"Satellite Baby\"\n\n2007\n\nN/A\n\n\n\"My Neck, My Back (Lick It)\"\n\n2013\n\nAndrew Putschoegl\n\n\n\"Main Event\"\n\n2014\n\nN/A\n\n\n\"Eliminated\"\n\n2014\n\nKija Manhar\u00e9\n\n\n\"Keyboard Courage\"\n\n2015\n\nGordon Cowie\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2000\n\nThe Convent\n\nDickie-Boy\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\nTrue Rights\n\nCleo\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\nSuper Duper\n\nMaddie\n\nShort film\n\n\n2002\n\nSuperfag\n\nApacalipstick\n\nShort film\n\n\n2004\n\nStraight Eye: The Movie\n\nHerself\n\nShort film\n\n\n2004\n\nBuds for Life\n\nSierra Bonita\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\nThe Boys & Girls Guide to Getting Down\n\nDrag Queen\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\nAmerican Dream\n\nKatrina\n\nPost-production\n\n\n2013\n\nConfessions of a Womanizer\n\nGinger\n\n\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1999\n\nUndressed\n\nHowie\n\nEpisode: \"Love It or Leave It Again\"\n\n\n2003\n\nNYPD Blue\n\nDan \"Monika\" Hoffnagle\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n2003\n\nNip/Tuck\n\nTransgender Woman No. 2\n\nEpisode: \"Sofia Lorez Part II\"\n\n\n2003\n\n10-8: Officers on Duty\n\nRaven\n\nEpisode: \"Badlands\"\n\n\n2003\n\nCold Case\n\nDrag Performer No. 2\n\nEpisode: \"A Time to Hate\"\n\n\n2003\n\nJust Shoot Me!\n\nRobert 'Nina Man Horn'\n\nEpisode: \"The Goodbye Girl\"\n\n\n2004\n\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\n\nBartender\n\nEpisode: \"Ch-Ch-Changes\"\n\n\n2004\n\nJudging Amy\n\nVelvet\n\nEpisode: \"Order and Chaos\"\n\n\n2005\n\nGeorge Lopez\n\nDeep Voice Singer\n\nEpisode: \"George Buys a Vow\"\n\n\n2005\n\nEve\n\nRudy\n\nEpisode: \"Moral Minority\"\n\n\n2005\n\nCuts\n\nPeter\n\nEpisode: \"Strictly Bizz-Nass\"\n\n\n2008\n\nThe New Adventures of Old Christine\n\nSparkle\n\nEpisode: \"Happy Endings\"\n\n\n2009\n\nSouthland\n\nLacey\n\nEpisode: \"See the Woman\"\n\n\n2011\n\nOne Night Stand Up\n\nHerself\n\nEpisode: \"Dragtastic NYC\"\n\n\n2011\n\nMike & Molly\n\nSteven\n\nEpisode: \"Joyce & Vince And Peaches & Herb\"\n\n\n2011\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\n\nKelly\n\nEpisode: \"Palestinian Chicken\"\n\n\n2012\n\nEagleheart\n\n'Maph\n\nEpisode: \"Little Dude\"\n\n\n2012\n\nRizzoli & Isles\n\nKitty\n\nEpisode: \"Melt My Heart to Stone\"\n\n\n2012\n\nThe New Normal\n\nAubrey\n\nEpisode: \"Pilot\"\n\n\n2014\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race\n\nHerself\n\nEpisode: \"RuPaul's Big Opening (Part 1)\"  14th place\n\n\n2016\n\nGay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul\n\nHerself\n\n1 episode\n\n\n2018\n\nLucifer\n\nDonovan McCann / Cher\n\nEpisode: \"Let Pinhead Sing!\"\n\n\n2019\n\nModern Family\n\nDrag Queen\n\nEpisode: \"The Last Halloween\"\n\nWeb series[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2013\n\nLove On-The-Line\n\nHimself\n\nSeason 1, Episode 9: \"The Meet-Cute Part II\"\n\n\nTheatre[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nTheatre\n\n\n1994\n\nEastern Standard[18]\n\nPeter Kidde\n\nRupel Jones Theatre\n\n\n1994\n\nRed Scare on Sunset[19]\n\nMalcolm\n\nSooner Theatre\n\n\n1994\n\nThe Foreigner[20]\n\nEllard Simms\n\nRupel Jones Theatre\n\n\n1994\n\nHoldenville[21]\n\n\n\nRupel Jones Theatre\n\n\n1995\n\nThe Nerd[22]\n\nWillum Cubbert\n\nWeitzenhoffer Theatre\n\n\n1995\n\nLysistrata[23]\n\n\n\nWeitzenhoffer Theatre\n\n\n1996\n\nThe Convention[5]\n\nSammy Wilcox\n\nThe Comedy Asylum\n\n\n1997\n\nRoyal Flush[6]\n\nCamille\n\nAthenaeum Theatre\n\n\n1997\n\nLone Star/Laundry & Bourbon[8]\n\nRay/Hattie\n\nOKRA Theatre\n\n\n1998\n\nFour Dogs and a Bone[24]\n\nVictor\n\nCafe Voltaire\n\n\n1998\n\nVampire Lesbians of Sodom[9]\n\nMadeleine\n\nAaah!

With over a quarter billion views online, Marsh has been described by CBS as \"the internet's most beloved anti-bully.\"[2]\nMarsh is genderqueer and uses the singular they as their pronoun of choice and \"Mx.\" as a gender-ambiguous honorific. Marsh has also identified at various times as a gay man, queer, and genderfluid.\n\nContents\n\n1 How to Be You\n2 Early life and education\n3 Career and non-profit involvement\n4 Recognition\n5 Live performance and cabaret\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nHow to Be You[edit]\nIn August 2016, Marsh released their first book, How to Be You, via Penguin Random House.[3][4] The book is Marsh's own story of \"growing up fabulous in a small farming town,\" and also serves as a workbook, inviting readers to participate in activities and answer questions about how they do the things they do.\nNBC News describes the book as \"Part memoir, part self-help, but also a workbook,\" and \"'a love letter' to Marsh's 11-year-old self.\"[5]\nIn conjunction with the release of How to Be You, they also became a regular contributing writer for TIME[6][7] and Oprah.com.[8][9]\nDigital Journal wrote with regards to the publication of How to Be You that \"Marsh became a social media star by being kind. And fabulous.\"[10]\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nMarsh was born in York, Pennsylvania, and grew up on a farm nearby. Marsh has spoken often about having felt misunderstood during a self-identified rough childhood.\nMarsh attended college at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and earned a BFA in Musical Theater, later moving to New York City to pursue a career in cabaret performance[11] before going on to become a successful online personality[12] and leader in the LGBTIQ community.[13]\n\nCareer and non-profit involvement[edit]\nMarsh posted their first Vine on October 22, 2013 \u2013 a simple 6-second vignette featuring the artist strumming a guitar. Their first Vine to become popular posted on July 4, 2014, featuring Marsh dressed as the Statue of Liberty. As of Sept. 2016, Marsh's Vine account has over 300 million loops.\nMarsh's Vines usually feature an affirming or empowering statement delivered directly to the camera, or a song, joke, or dance. Their most popular Vine to date, with over 26 million loops, shows Marsh saying, \"I can predict the future, and you're going to be ok.\" It is the Vine that Bustle claims \"broke Tumblr with its greatness.\"[1]\nMashable was the first mainstream media outlet to label Marsh the Internet's \"anti-bully.\"[14] The Huffington Post has said of Marsh: \"In the technological age, the face of activism has evolved along with the way in which we communicate. Marsh is part of a generation of LGBTQ activists who, through social media, are changing minds and perceptions in parts of the world where people may not encounter a queer person in their day to day lives.\"[15] Digg has described Marsh's overall message as, \"Be yourself. Be happy with yourself. Be more comfortable with your differences \u2014 and embrace and enjoy them.\"[16]\nMarsh is the official social media ambassador and red carpet correspondent for the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN),[2] working closely with the organization on their #BeYourSelfie campaign. Marsh interviewed several celebrities, including Zachary Quinto and J.J. Abrams, on the red carpet at the 2015 GLSEN Respect Awards.[17]\nMarsh was the official Viner for the Logo TV network at the premier of Laverne Cox's \"The T Word.\"\nMarsh created a viral vine for GLAAD's #LoveWins campaign[18] (celebrating marriage equality) and helped create the #GotYourBack campaign with the media awareness group's staff.[19] Marsh has also worked with The Trevor Project to prevent teen suicide, through their #HeartYourself hashtag campaign.\nMarsh also created the #NoTimeToHate myself and #DontSayThatsSoGay campaigns on Vine to combat homophobia and bring awareness to genderqueer identity.[16]\nAbout Vine, Marsh told Digg, \"I make Vines as a time machine, I'm making them for my 10-year-old self back in Pennsylvania on the farm. Which, as I've come to find out, there are a lot of 10-year-old 'me's' around. [My Vines] are a way to bring healing to everybody, including me.\"[16]\nMarsh is a regular contributor to The Huffington Post, where they've also been interviewed.[20]\nAfter The New York Times tweeted a cartoon portraying presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin as a gay lovers, Marsh said \"There seems to be no greater insult than comparing someone to a queer. For an LGBTQ youth, it\u2019s not background noise. When it comes up on their feed it feels like a direct personal attack, and to have a group that\u2019s as well-established as the New York Times personally attacking you feels horrendous.\"[21]\n\nRecognition[edit]\nOne of Marsh's Vines was chosen #5 in BuzzFeed's list of the top Vines of 2014.[22] It depicts Marsh saying, \"Don't forget: you have as much of a right to be here as anyone else.\" Because of their viral popularity, they were awarded the title \"Vine's Transgender Superheroine\" by Digg.[16]\nJeffrey has said on the response they received from members of the public: \"There's a wall of hate that comes at you, but also there's a wall of love that comes at you. And still to this day, [I get] several messages a day: 'I was feeling alone. I was feeling desperate. I was feeling suicidal. Your video helped me. I'm going to stick around...thank you for doing what you're doing. If you can be yourself, so can I.'\"[23]\nJeffrey is the first nonbinary model for the bridal industry.[citation needed][24]\n\nLive performance and cabaret[edit]\nWhile living in Philadelphia after college, Marsh was well-known as a local performance artist, hosting a weekly cabaret at L'Etage produced by Robert Drake of WXPN public radio. Marsh's show, An Evening With Jeffrey Marsh,[25] was one of the founding performances of the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Theater Festival.\nThe Philadelphia City Paper described a performance at World Caf\u00e9 Live where Marsh \"proceeded to move from table to table, flinging people's silverware across the room, rearranging place settings,\" as \"uproarious.\" \"This is Marsh's appeal, crystallized,\" the review continued. \"You could describe his [sic] act as a drag thing, a vaudeville thing, a performance art variety show thing, and any of those would be completely missing the point.\"\nAfter moving to New York City in 2007, Marsh began performing as part of the downtown cabaret scene. Marsh appeared at popular venues including Joe's Pub[26] and Don't Tell Mama. At Dixon Place, they starred in \"Julian,\" a 2010 musical based on the life of Vaudeville performer Julian Eltinge.[27] In 2012, Marsh was commissioned to create a performance art piece honoring Richard Simmons at the Museum of Art and Design.[28]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Lord, Emma (August 31, 2015). \"Jeffrey Marsh's Inspirational Vines Will Soothe Your Soul In Less Than 6 Seconds\". bustle.com.

She had her breakthrough in the horror film Scream (1996) and subsequently headlined the films Going All the Way (1997), Devil in the Flesh (1998) and Jawbreaker (1999).\nDuring the 2000s, McGowan became known to television audiences for her role as Paige Matthews in The WB supernatural drama series Charmed (2001\u20132006). She starred in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's double-feature film Grindhouse (2007), and appeared in the action-thriller series Chosen (2014). In 2018, McGowan released her debut studio album, Planet 9, followed by a repackage in 2020.\nIn 2017, Time recognized McGowan as one of the Silence Breakers, the magazine's Person of the Year, for speaking out about sexual assault and harassment, specifically in regards to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases and the Me Too movement.[4] She has released a memoir, Brave, and starred in the four-part documentary series Citizen Rose, both in 2018.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Early roles and breakthrough (1992\u20132000)\n2.2 Charmed and Grindhouse (2001\u20132007)\n2.3 Independent film route (2008\u20132013)\n2.4 Professional expansion (2014\u2013present)\n\n\n3 Appearances in music\n4 Personal life\n\n4.1 Relationships\n4.2 Harvey Weinstein rape and sexual harassment allegations\n\n\n5 Views and controversies\n6 Filmography\n\n6.1 Film\n6.2 Television\n6.3 Video games\n6.4 Web series\n6.5 Music videos\n\n\n7 Discography\n8 Bibliography\n9 Awards and recognition\n10 References\n11 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMcGowan was born September 5, 1973, in Florence, Italy,[5] to American couple Daniel McGowan, an artist,[5] and Terri, a writer. She has two half-siblings.[6] Her father ran an Italian chapter of the Children of God, which he and his wife were members of until 1978.[7] McGowan spent her early childhood at the group's communes, often traveling through Europe with her parents.[6]\nThrough her father's art contacts in Italy, she became a child model and appeared in Vogue Bambini and various other Italian magazines. Her parents returned to the United States when she was 10 years old, and settled in Eugene, Oregon.[6][8] McGowan had an untraditional childhood, living as a teenage runaway in Portland, Oregon and associating with a group of drag queens in the city.[6][9] When her parents divorced, she lived with her father in Seattle, Washington, attended Roosevelt High School and Nova Alternative High School, and worked at McDonald's. She took ballet lessons until she was 13. At 15, she officially emancipated herself from her parents[10] and moved to Los Angeles.\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly roles and breakthrough (1992\u20132000)[edit]\nAfter making her Hollywood film debut with a brief role in the Pauly Shore comedy Encino Man (1992), McGowan was cast in the leading role in Gregg Araki's dark comedy The Doom Generation (1995), which revolved around a threesome of teens who embark on a sex and violence-filled journey. The film brought her a much wider recognition and the attention of film critics; she received a nomination for Best Debut Performance at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards. McGowan next obtained the role of Tatum Riley in the slasher cult film Scream (1996), as the casting director believed she best embodied the \"spunky\", \"cynical\" but \"innocent\" nature of the ill-fated character.[11] Upon its release, the film became a huge critical and financial success, grossing over $100 million in North America and $173 million worldwide.[12] Amid her growing public profile, she was the cover model for the Henry Mancini tribute album Shots in the Dark, which was released in 1996, and became the face of American clothing company Bebe from 1998 to 1999.\nIn 1997, she appeared in the short film Seed, directed by San Francisco-born filmmaker Karin Thayer, and played opposite Peter O'Toole in the 1998 film adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel Phantoms. McGowan spent the majority of the late 1990s headlining a variety of independent films, including roles in Nowhere (1997), where she reunited with Araki, as well as Southie (1996), Going All the Way (1997), Lewis and Clark and George (1997), and Devil in the Flesh (1998), where she usually played seductive and mysterious characters. She gained much attention for the revealing fishnet outfit she wore to the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.[13][14][15][16]\nIn the dark comedy Jawbreaker (1999), she portrayed Courtney Shayne, a popular yet malevolent high school student who tries to cover up her involvement in a classmate's murder. McGowan based her performance on that of Gene Tierney's sociopathic character in Leave Her to Heaven (1945).[17] To accompany the release of the film, Imperial Teen's music video for the song Yoo Hoo featured McGowan as her character harassing the band members with jawbreakers.[18] Jawbreaker was a critical and commercial failure, but found success through home video release and subsequent television airings; it has developed a cult following.[17] McGowan earned a nomination for Best Villain at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards.\n\nCharmed and Grindhouse (2001\u20132007)[edit]\nIn 2001, McGowan was cast for the role of Paige Matthews in the popular WB supernatural drama series Charmed, as a replacement for the lead actress Shannen Doherty, who had left the show. In the show, about the trio of witches using their combined powers to protect innocent lives from evil beings, McGowan played the character from season four until its final eighth season. In a review of the fourth season, Leigh H. Edwards of PopMatters added that the addition of Paige was \"contrived and clunky\", but welcomed the idea of McGowan joining the show as a witch \"since she has major goth cred as Marilyn Manson's former flame\".[19] DVD Verdict's Cynthia Boris wrote that McGowan brought \"a youthfulness\" and \"a fresh viewer perspective\" to Charmed, further noting that \"fans have come to enjoy her presence on the show.\"[20] Sara Paige and Rachel Hyland of Geek Speak magazine described Paige as \"snarky, compassionate and whimsical\", and believed that \"McGowan was well-suited for the role.\"[21] At the 2001 Wand Awards, McGowan was nominated for Best New Cast Member and at the 2005 Family Television Awards, she won Favorite Sister, for her performance.\n\n McGowan at the 2007 premiere of Grindhouse\nMcGowan starred alongside Brendan Fraser, Bridget Fonda, and Whoopi Goldberg in the dark fantasy comedy Monkeybone (2001) as a cat girl from a limbo-like carnival landscape where nightmares are entertainment. Budgeted at US$75 million, the film only made US$7.6 million;[22] McGowan felt that film \"would've been incredible (at least the underworld part) if the men at 20th Century Fox (the suits) hadn't fired the director, a true artist, Henry Selick [half] the way through filming\", and called his dismissal a \"profoundly stupid move\".[23] During Charmed, McGowan portrayed actress-singer Ann-Margret in the CBS miniseries Elvis (2005), about the life of Elvis Presley. She also appeared briefly as the roommate of the titular character in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia (2006), a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria and opposite Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank.\nIn 2007, McGowan headlined Grindhouse, a double feature horror film by directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. In Rodriguez's segment, Planet Terror, she starred as a go-go dancer and the leader of a group of rebels attempting to survive an onslaught of zombie-like creatures as they feud with a rogue military unit, while in Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, she played a brief role as a victim of a misogynistic, psychopathic stuntman who targets young women with his \"death proof\" stunt car. While Grindhouse made a lackluster US$25.5 million in its theatrical release,[24] it was the subject of much media coverage and critical acclaim from critics; James Berardinelli found McGowan to be the \"standout here\" and Mick LaSalle considered the film as \"the best showcase of [McGowan] career so far\".[25][26]\n\nIndependent film route (2008\u20132013)[edit]\nHer next film release, Fifty Dead Men Walking (2008), revolved around Martin McGartland, a British agent who went undercover into the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). McGowan played a woman in the upper ranks of the organisation who offers herself to McGartland. After the film concluded shooting, McGowan sparked controversy in the United Kingdom, where she stated that she would have joined the IRA had she lived in Belfast during the era and that her \"heart just broke for the cause\".[27] The film found a limited audience in theaters[28] while critical response was positive.[29] Also in 2008, McGowan took on a recurring role as a con artist on the acclaimed drama series Nip/Tuck, and co-hosted the TCM's film-series program The Essentials alongside Robert Osbourne, discussing classic Hollywood film.[30]\nIn 2010, McGowan shot a cameo in the Robert Rodriguez feature Machete, a role ultimately cut, but included on the DVD release, and played a semi-homeless junkie in the fantasy drama Dead Awake. In the 3-D sword and sorcery film Conan the Barbarian (2011), a reimagining of the 1982 film of the same name which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, McGowan starred as an evil half-human/half-witch.[31][32] Roger Ebert described her role as a \"piece of work\", writing: \"She has white pancake makeup, blood red lips, cute little facial tattoos and wickedly sharp metal talons on her fingers\".[33] Filming occurred between March and July 2010 in Bulgaria, and Conan was released on August 19, 2011.[34] Budgeted at US$90 million, the film received negative reviews,[35] and only grossed US$48.8 worldwide.[36]\n\n McGowan at The Heart Truth's Red Dress Collection Fashion Show in 2012\nIn addition to her role in the big-budgeted Conan, McGowan starred in mainly independent productions during the early 2010s, such as the psychological thriller Rosewood Lane (2011) from director Victor Salva, the made-for-television film The Pastor's Wife (2011), alongside Michael Shanks, and a film adaptation of The Tell-Tale Heart, released in 2016. McGowan lent her voice to the video games Darkwatch, playing a femme fatale named Tala, and Terminator Salvation, as a troubled soldier named Angie Salter. She guest-starred in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as a grifter who targets New York sex clubs, and also in two episodes of Once Upon A Time between 2012 and 2014, playing the role of the young Cora Mills.\n\nProfessional expansion (2014\u2013present)[edit]\nIn the third season of Chosen (2014), a television series airing via Crackle, McGowan took on the role of an experienced hunter. She made her directorial debut with a short film called Dawn, which revolved around a teen from a strict family falls under the spell of a gas-station employee. The 17-minute piece premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, to critical acclaim; Way Too Indie noted: \"This was a real gem of a short film. Dawn's salient literary and cultural references, paired with the film's high production value, gorgeous shots, its slow-burner buildup and gripping conclusion, bring something to the table for everyone, and portends an excellent directorial career for Ms. McGowan\".[37]\nIn September 2015, McGowan released her debut single, titled \"RM486\". The song has strong feminist themes, with its title being a play on the abortion drug RU486 and McGowan's initials.[38] The Sound (2017), an independent Canadian horror film, starred McGowan as a best-selling author and paranormal investigator alongside Christopher Lloyd and Michael Eklund.[39] The Hollywood Reporter wrote of her role: \"Despite her sympathetic situation, [it] isn't a particularly interesting character. A dismissive attitude and superior self-regard don't improve her likability either. McGowan seems comfortable with the role, however [...]\".[40]\nOn January 30, 2018, McGowan released a memoir,  Brave, in which she details her childhood and her account of the assault by Harvey Weinstein and its aftermath.[41][42][43] On January 31, 2018, Citizen Rose, a four-part documentary series produced by Bunim/Murray Productions following McGowan and her role in the Me Too movement premiered.[44][45] In August 2018, McGowan was announced to receive the Inspiration Award at the GQ Men Of The Year Awards.[46]\nMcGowan appears in the art film Indecision IV, which combines dance and gender issues. \"Shot in one continuous take, the film [...] was created in May 2018, during a watershed moment in McGowan's life and is a physical expression of her state of mind at that time,\" a press statement stated. The piece was commissioned by UK's Heist Gallery, and is set to have special screenings at the Institute of Light in East London on December 15 and 16, with proceeds going to the charity Refuge.[47]\n\nAppearances in music[edit]\n McGowan in 2011\nWhile dating Marilyn Manson, McGowan appeared in a music video for the song \"Coma White\";[48] she performed backing vocals on the song \"Posthuman\".[49] Both of these songs appear on the album Mechanical Animals (1998).[50]\nMcGowan appeared on a Brian Transeau track called \"Superfabulous\", from his album Emotional Technology, which was also featured on the final Charmed soundtrack, The Final Chapter.[51] The song has been featured in several films, including Win a Date with Tad Hamilton![52] and Raising Helen. She wrote and recorded a song titled \"Protection\", which was featured in her film Strange Hearts (2011). McGowan has also appeared in the Imperial Teen music video for \"Yoo Hoo\",[53] which was featured on the Jawbreaker soundtrack, and she recorded the theme song from the film Dead Awake (2010).   \nMore recently, McGowan was mentioned in the Gus Dapperton song \"World Class Cinema\", which came out with the album Where Polly People Go to Read in 2018. \nMcGowan has expressed interest in recording an album of her own. During an interview with Living TV, she said, \"I was actually thinking of going back and doing more soulful tunes and older tunes\u00a0... and I would love to, when I have a little bit more time.\" In the Charmed episode \"Sense and Sense Ability\", McGowan performed, in character, a cover of the Peggy Lee classic \"Fever\". She performed three songs from the Planet Terror portion of Grindhouse, released on the film's soundtrack by the Var\u00e8se Sarabande label.[54] The songs are entitled \"You Belong to Me\" (a Dean Martin/Jo Stafford cover), \"Useless Talent #32\", and \"Two Against the World\".\nShe appeared briefly in the music video for the 2014 single \"Break the Rules\" by Charli XCX.[55]\nOn April 21, 2020 she announced that her debut studio album Planet 9, originally released in 2018, would be re-released on April 24.[56]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMcGowan is an activist for LGBT rights[57][58] and campaigned against California's Proposition 8,[58] which sought to ban same-sex marriage in the state in 2008.[57] She is also known as an activist for Boston Terriers. She has two, named Bug and Fester, and has personally donated to various Boston Terrier rescues. McGowan reportedly encouraged friends to donate to Boston Terrier Rescue Net, and according to BTRN: \"Having fallen in love with Bug and Fester, her friends donated generously. It amounted to a considerable contribution, which will go a long way in helping BTRN and the needy volunteers who selflessly give to deserving Bostons.\"[59]\nIn late 2009, McGowan was among several celebrities who participated in the protest NOH8.[58]\n\n McGowan in 2009\nIn January 2019, McGowan pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor drug charge in Virginia concerning cocaine that was found in a wallet she left behind at Dulles International Airport in 2017. She received a US$2,500 fine and a suspended jail sentence.[60]\n\nRelationships[edit]\nIn the early 1990s, McGowan, then relatively unknown, was involved for two years with a man she refers to as William, who, she claims, kept buying her exercise equipment and fashion magazines in an effort to persuade her to get thinner. She developed an eating disorder in her unsuccessful efforts to get her weight down to 84 pounds (38\u00a0kg) like the women in the magazines. \"I never was able to get below 92 pounds (42\u00a0kg),\" she wrote later. \"I felt like a failure.\"[61]\nThat relationship and the eating disorder ended in early 1993 when McGowan met Brett Cantor, a part-owner of Hollywood's Dragonfly nightclub.[62] Cantor was brutally stabbed to death in his house that July, and McGowan stated that it left her \"shattered\". The killing remains unsolved.[61]\nMcGowan had a three-and-a-half-year relationship with rock musician Marilyn Manson. After a formal engagement lasting two years, McGowan ended the relationship in 2001 over \"lifestyle differences\".[63]\nPrior to the release of Grindhouse, there was speculation that McGowan was dating director Robert Rodriguez.[64][65] In May 2007, it was reported that they confirmed their relationship while appearing hand-in-hand at the Cannes Film Festival.[66] On October 12, 2007, it was announced by Zap2it.com that McGowan was engaged to Rodriguez.[67] They reportedly split in October 2009.[68]\nIn July 2013, after one year of dating, McGowan became engaged to artist Davey Detail.[69] They married on October 12, 2013 in Los Angeles.[70] In February 2016, she filed for divorce from Detail, citing irreconcilable differences.[71] The divorce was finalized in November 2016.[72]\n\nHarvey Weinstein rape and sexual harassment allegations[edit]\nMain article: Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations\nSee also: Me Too movement\nThe New York Times revealed, in October 2017, that she received a $100,000 settlement from movie mogul Harvey Weinstein in relation to an alleged sexual assault in 1997.[73] \"Women fight on,\" she wrote afterwards. \"And to the men out there, stand up. We need you as allies.\" It was alleged that the encounter had taken place in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.[73][74]\nOn October 10, 2017, McGowan accused actor Ben Affleck of lying for saying he was \"angry\" over Weinstein's alleged abuse of women but failing to indicate whether he knew about it even though she had told him Weinstein had acted inappropriately towards her.[75] Via Twitter, she also attacked other men in the movie industry, tweeting, \"All of you Hollywood 'A-list' golden boys are LIARS....You all knew.\"[76][77] She later clarified that she told Affleck, while crying, that she had \"just come from Harvey's and he said, 'Goddamn it, I told him to stop doing that.' It's not like I'm raging at Ben Affleck. I never said to him, 'I was just raped.' It's just more to illustrate the point of this continual thing of everybody knowing and everybody being part of it, unwittingly or proactively.\"[78]\nOn October 12, McGowan alleged that Harvey Weinstein had raped her, and that Amazon Studios dropped her project after she complained.[79] On the same day, McGowan said that Twitter suspended her account for 12 hours after she repeatedly tweeted about Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct, including toward her.[80] Twitter explained that McGowan's account had violated its privacy policy because one of her tweets included a private phone number. The New York Times reported, \"Many Twitter users expressed outrage over Ms. McGowan's account being locked.\" After the tweet was removed, her account was unlocked several hours before the 12-hour ban was set to expire.[77] Through his lawyer, David Boies, Weinstein at one point hired the private intelligence agency Black Cube to spy on McGowan and to stop outlets such as The New York Times and The New Yorker from reporting their investigations on Harvey Weinstein.[81]\nOn February 7, 2018, Jill Messick, McGowan's manager at the time of the alleged rape in 1997, died by suicide.[82] Messick's family blamed Weinstein, the media, the public, and McGowan for her death.[83]\n\nViews and controversies[edit]\nIn September 2008, McGowan caused controversy while promoting her film Fifty Dead Men Walking at a Toronto International Film Festival press conference, when she stated, \"I imagine, had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100% have been in the IRA. My heart just broke for the cause. Violence is not to be played out daily and provide an answer to problems, but I understand it.\" This prompted director Kari Skogland and the film's producers to issue a public apology, stating that McGowan's views did not reflect their own.[84]\n\n McGowan at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival\nIn an August 2011 interview, McGowan talked about her experience working on the film Rosewood Lane with director Victor Salva, who is a convicted child molester and child pornographer,[85][86] stating, \"I still don't really understand the whole story or history there, and I'd rather not, because it's not really my business. But he's an incredibly sweet and gentle man.\"[85]\nIn May 2014, McGowan held a defiant party in support of the Brunei-owned Beverly Hills Hotel, despite a boycott over Brunei's anti-gay laws, which prescribes death by stoning for same-sex activities.[87] McGowan explained her stance on the issue thus: \"Boycotts only work when they hurt the target's bottom line. We are never going to affect the sultan's bottom line. He's worth $20 billion! This is a vanity project for him. It could sit empty for 100 years and he wouldn't even notice. But meanwhile, we're hurting all the wonderful, struggling people who work in the hotel. I'd like him to see that gays are real people. I think that's the only thing that would change his mind, not a boycott.\"[88]\nIn November 2014, while discussing misogyny and sexism during Bret Easton Ellis' podcast, McGowan criticized the gay community for not doing more to help the cause of women's rights, saying, \"I see now, basically, people who've fought for the right to stand on top of a float wearing an orange speedo and take molly. And, I see no help, and I see no paying it forward, and I have a huge problem with that. There are so many things to help and do, and I see no extending of a hand outside of the gay community to another community. And that's a problem for me.\" Rose McGowan also stated, \"Gays are as misogynistic as straight men, if not more so. I have an indictment of the gay community right now. I'm actually really upset with them.\" The characterization of LGBT rights activism being centered on drug use and wearing revealing clothing in public was criticized as homophobic or transphobic.[89][90][91][92][93] She later apologized for generalizing gay men as misogynistic, but defended the rest of her comments. She explained that \"I do expect more from a group of people that understands discrimination. \u2026 What I want is for gay rights activists to help other disenfranchised groups. These activists are experts while so many other groups flounder. It\u2019s time to share the wealth and knowledge\".[94][95]\nIn June 2015, McGowan tweeted about a casting note attached to an audition script she had received for an Adam Sandler film. The note asked those auditioning to wear form-fitting clothing that showed off their cleavage, and to wear a pushup bra. She considered the note sexist and later said, \"It was just so dumb. I was offended by the stupidity more than anything. I was offended by the fact that went through so many people's hands and nobody red flagged it. This is normal to so many people. It was probably even a girl that had to type it up. It's institutionally OK.\" She said she had been fighting against sexism in Hollywood for over twenty years.[96][97][98] McGowan's agent responded by firing her.[97][98] \"I'm interested in making the industry better so that women following in my footsteps know that they don't have to take abuse just because she wants be creative,\" the actress told People magazine.[99]\nIn 2015, McGowan criticized Caitlyn Jenner for stating that \"the hardest part about being a woman is figuring out what to wear\", after Jenner had been named \"Woman of the Year\" by Glamour. McGowan stated, \"We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well f**cking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.\"[90][100] In response to accusations of transphobia, McGowan stated, \"Let me take this moment to point out that I am not, nor will I ever be, transphobic. The idea is laughable. Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism.\"[101]\nIn early January 2020, McGowan  apologized to Iran for the United States' behavior in a tweet sent out in the hours after a US airstrike in Iraq killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani. She wrote, \"Dear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime.

Their mother later remarried.[2]\nMeyers attended a private Christian school affiliated with their church, and was a competitive cheerleader.[3] They were cut from their school sports teams and cheerleading squad and claimed they were harassed by school administrators after their family started attending a more progressive church. At 16 years old, Meyers transferred to a public high school.[2]\nMeyers attended university in Chicago, studying public relations.[4] They struggled with bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa while in college.[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nMeyers moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to work in public relations. Not long after, they quit their job and began working at a fitness studio that specialized in Megaformer pilates routines. After a coworker opened a fitness studio in Dallas, Meyers moved to Texas and began working there,[4] and later worked as a fitness instructor at SLT Studio in New York City[6][7] before launching their own workout and fitness business called be.come.[8][9][10] The firm's workouts are a mixture of pilates, yoga, and strength training.[7][11] They gained notability on Instagram for their workout tutorials and healthy lifestyle posts.[7][12] In July 2018 Meyers, launched the fitness app for be.come, [13] specializing in body-positive workouts.[14] Meyers releases weekly 25-minute workout routines through the app,[15] teaches fitness classes online through the be.come app and website, and taught classes at Studio B in Manhattan before opening a workout facility in Union Square in September 2018.[16][17]\nIn 2018, Meyers and Nico Tortorella announced they were working on filming a global television show focusing on gender, sexuality and relationships.[18] In December 2018, they partnered with Lovers, a sex toy retailer, to launch a private label under the campaign #WeAreLovers.[19] In May 2018, Meyers and Tortorella co-hosted the 33rd AIDS Walk New York in Central Park, raising $4,416,919.[20] In December 2018, Meyers gave a TED talk on empowerment and body neutrality.[21]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMeyers identifies as sexually fluid and queer, having been in relationships with men and women, and has also identified as bisexual and non-binary.[22] Meyers uses singular they/them pronouns.[23] In 2017 Meyers proposed to actor Nico Tortorella, whom they met in college, after eleven years of dating.[24] On March 9, 2018 Meyers and Tortorella married[25] in a civil ceremony at a Manhattan City Clerk's office before exchanging vows at St. Paul's Chapel, an Episcopal church and parish church of Trinity Church Wall Street.[26][27] They both wore gender non-conforming outfits designed by Andrew Morrison with crowns.[28] Meyers and Tortorella are in a polyamorous marriage and both openly date other people.[29][30][31]\nOn 27 September 2018, in the wake of allegations of sexual assault made against Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford during his nomination for the Supreme Court, Meyers posted on social media about their experience being sexually assaulted. Meyers had been sexually assaulted by a former boyfriend and thought about coming forward after other celebrities had joined the Me Too movement, but did not until hearing Ford's testimony.[32]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Nico Tortorella and Bethany Meyers' Unconventional Relationship | ELLE Australia\". elle.com.au.

In 2010, Miller portrayed the lead of Beware the Gonzo and had a supporting role in Every Day, both of which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.

The band is a trio that features Lilah Larson (vocals, guitar, bass and drums), Josh Aubin (bass, keyboards, guitar, vocals) and Miller.[23][24] In 2019, the band released a cover of \"Don't Cha\" by the Pussycat Dolls and Miller appeared in its music video.[25]\nMiller played Credence Barebone in the 2016 film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a spin-off of the Harry Potter film series.

I've been attracted mostly to 'shes' but I've been with many people and I'm open to love whatever it can be.\"[19] Miller also commented on having \"a lot of really wonderful friends who are of very different sexes and genders. I am very much in love with no one in particular.\"[15][35]\nMiller uses they/them pronouns, which GQ Britain stated is done \"in a pointed refusal to be gendered\".[36] Miller stated that, for them, queer means \"I don't identify as a man. I don't identify as a woman. I barely identify as a human.\"[37] Having used all pronouns interchangeably,[38] Miller has also stated that they are \"comfortable with all the pronouns\" and that they \"let he/his/him ride, and that's fine.\"[39] Although Miller has been credited as a queer icon, GQ Britain stated that they also eschew the term queer, \"as even queer is a label to them\".[36]\nMiller revealed having had a personal #MeToo experience with a Hollywood producer and a director, both unnamed. Miller said, \"They gave me wine and I was underaged. They were like, 'Hey, want to be in our movie about gay revolution?' And I was like, 'No, you guys are monsters.'\" Miller then went on to show support for the #MeToo movement.[37]\nIn 2010, Miller dated Zo\u00eb Kravitz while they were filming Beware the Gonzo.[40]\nOn June 28, 2011, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, while shooting The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Miller was a passenger in a vehicle that was pulled over for a broken brake light, and police discovered 20 grams of marijuana in their possession.[1][41] Initially, Miller was charged with drug possession, but the charge was later dropped by a judge. Instead, Miller faced a penalty of $600 for two citations of disorderly conduct.[20] Miller later commented: \"I don't feel like there's any need to hide the fact that I smoke pot. It's a harmless herbal substance that increases sensory appreciation.\"[42]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2008\n\nAfterschool\n\nRobert\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\nCity Island\n\nVincent \"Vinnie\" Rizzo Jr.\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nBeware the Gonzo\n\nEddie \"Gonzo\" Gilman\n\n\n\n\nEvery Day\n\nJonah\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\nAnother Happy Day\n\nElliot Hellman\n\n\n\n\nBusted Walk\n\nJay Turner\n\nShort film\n\n\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin\n\nKevin Khatchadourian\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\n\nPatrick\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\nMadame Bovary\n\nLeon Dupuis\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment\n\nDaniel Culp / Prisoner 8612\n\n\n\n\nTrainwreck\n\nDonald\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n\nBarry Allen / The Flash\n\nCameo\n\n\nSuicide Squad\n\nCameo\n\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\n\nCredence Barebone\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nJustice League\n\nBarry Allen / The Flash\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\n\nCredence Barebone\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\nUntitled third Fantastic Beasts film\n\nFilming\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2008\n\nCakey!

Monroe initially rose to prominence for writing a blog titled A Girl Called Jack (now renamed Cooking on a Bootstrap), and has since written for publications such as The Echo, The Huffington Post, The Guardian, and The New Yorker, as well as publishing several cookbooks focusing on \"austerity recipes\" and meals which can be made on a tight budget.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Writing\n2.2 Campaigning and politics\n\n\n3 Personal life\n\n3.1 Legal action\n\n\n4 Bibliography\n\n4.1 Cookery books\n\n\n5 See also\n6 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMonroe was born in Southend-on-Sea in 1988, to David Hadjicostas MBE, and Evelyn (n\u00e9e Beatty) Hadjicostas, a former nurse. Her father is of Greek-Cypriot heritage; he was in the British Army for seven years and in the fire service for 30 years.[3][4][5] He was awarded an MBE in 2007 Birthday Honours for services to children and families.[6] Monroe has three siblings.[4][7]\nDescribed as coming from a working-class background,[8] Monroe passed the 11-plus examinations and attended Westcliff High School for Girls, a grammar school in Westcliff-on-Sea, before leaving at age 16, \"bullied and disillusioned\",[8] with insufficient GCSEs to progress to A-level (she sat 7 and passed 4 and a half of them).[9]\nMonroe left home and worked in a chip shop, before taking a job as a call handler for Essex County Fire and Rescue Service. After having a child, she was unable to arrange the work around childcare responsibilities, and was unable to negotiate adjustments to her working pattern to make continued employment feasible. Monroe resigned the post after serving between 2007 and 2011. After leaving the fire service, Monroe began going by the forename Jack \u2013 being short for \"Jack of all trades\".[8][10] She spent the following 18 months on benefits and looking for work, and moved from relative affluence to poverty and financial hardship.[11][12][13][14]\n\nCareer[edit]\nWriting[edit]\nMonroe came to prominence in the media through writing the blog A Girl Called Jack, sharing cheap recipes created as a single parent with a young child, and aiming to provide family meals for less than \u00a310 per week.[15] In December 2015, the blog was renamed as Cooking on a Bootstrap.\nIn 2012, Monroe became a weekly columnist for The Echo,[16] a south Essex daily newspaper, and in February 2013, was taken on by the same as a trainee reporter \u2013 the timing was fortunate, as she was having difficulty affording nursery fees. Monroe was later retained as an unpaid columnist for The Huffington Post, before signing a publishing deal with Penguin Group.[17] The book deal, reported as worth \u00a325,000, resulted in housing benefit being cut off and Monroe came close to being evicted, which led to moving into cheaper accommodation. Despite working every day, she was unable to make ends meet.[8] By January 2014, finances had improved, and Monroe was able to move into a small two-bedroom flat with her son.[13]\nMonroe formerly wrote a twice-monthly food and recipe column for The Guardian[18] and additionally contributed a number of political columns, as well as being featured in The New York Times and The New Yorker. Monroe has written several budget cooking recipe books.[19][20]\nIn April 2020 it was announced that Monroe would co-host Daily Kitchen Live on BBC One alongside Matt Tebbutt. The programme, made in response to issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, offered tips and guidance to families struggling with limited resources, and aired daily for a two week period that commenced on 14 April 2020.[21]\n\nCampaigning and politics[edit]\nMonroe has been an active campaigner for a number of causes in the UK, particularly those concerned with poverty and hunger, campaigning alongside organisations such as Unite, The Trussell Trust, Child Poverty Action Group and Oxfam.[22][23]\nIn 2013, Monroe appeared in a six-week advertising campaign for Sainsbury's supermarket.[24] Monroe accepted the equivalent of the living wage for the six weeks that the campaign ran and donated the remainder of the fee to charities including a food bank.[25]\nMonroe was a supporter of the Labour Party, and appeared in a Labour campaign video in October 2013.[26] She left the party in March 2015 after disagreeing with its rhetoric on immigration,[27] and became a member of the Green Party of England and Wales.[28]\nIn November 2014, Monroe said on Twitter that David Cameron \"uses stories about his dead son as misty-eyed rhetoric to legitimise selling our NHS to his friends\".[29] The Daily Mail journalist Sarah Vine criticised Monroe for using the death of Cameron's son for political purposes and \"choosing\" a life of poverty. The Independent described this as a \"caustic attack\", and Monroe replied on Twitter that the column was \"homophobic, transphobic, deadnaming [and] ignorant\".[30]\nIn 2015, Monroe won the Women of the Future Award in the media category. Monroe was \"surprised\", saying \"I'm not sure I'll even be a woman in the future\".[31] The award was won after Monroe came out as non-binary, which created some controversy. The subsequent \"gender debate\" angered Monroe and she questioned the headlines of some newspapers, saying \"Because of my trans identity, I'm attacked for accepting a real woman's award.\"[32][33]\nIn April 2016, Monroe appeared online supporting the Women's Equality Party.[34]\nIn the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Monroe intended to stand in Southend West as a candidate for the National Health Action Party,[35] but withdrew after receiving death threats and because of health problems caused by arthritis.[36]\nSpeaking in 2014, Monroe described life as having \"changed beyond recognition\", but said that she is still affected by her experience of poverty.[19] The University of Essex announced in May 2015 that it would be awarding Monroe an honorary degree.[37]\nMonroe appeared on BBC television's late night political programme This Week in June 2015[38] and again in May 2019.[39]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMonroe came out as non-binary in October 2015,[11] and goes by they/them and she/her pronouns.[40] She has said she did not change her name to Jack while still working at the fire service, out of concern over \"the potential for deadnaming and bullying in a not-particularly-tolerant organisation. Not a great place to be gay, let alone genderqueer.\"  She also did not take part in a fire-service passing out ceremony, because protocol would have required her to wear a skirt.[41]  During this period, Monroe also had a brief relationship with a close male friend which resulted in a son.[42] She also had a long-term relationship with a woman which ended shortly after Monroe told her partner she was considering a mastectomy.[41]\nMonroe had previously identified as a cisgender lesbian, and prior to coming out as non-binary was careful to downplay any suggestions of gender ambiguity: in a February 2014 interview, she described herself as a \"lefty, liberal, lezzer cook\" who had reassured her parents that she identified as female. \"I was like, no, I'm a little bit tomboyish, a little bit butch. But I have no immediate plans to transition.\"[13]\nIn 2014, it was reported that Monroe and her son were living with Monroe's then girlfriend Allegra McEvedy and McEvedy's daughter in London; the relationship ended in October 2015.[43]\nIn 2017, Monroe revealed she was suffering from acute arthritis, citing the affliction as a partial cause for her suspending her campaign for candidacy in the National Health Action Party. In January 2019, Monroe stated that she was recovering from alcoholism, discussing how drinking had affected her work and personal life.[44] Later that month, Monroe announced her engagement to her partner, Louisa Compton.[45]\nMonroe was diagnosed with autism and ADHD as a child, though was not made aware of this until she was an adult.[46][47]\n\nLegal action[edit]\nMonroe initiated legal action in 2015 after the Daily Mail claimed that \"Jack\" was not her \"real\" name,[41] and has requested that her birth name not be used by the media.[11]\nIn 2017, Monroe won a libel case against newspaper columnist and television personality Katie Hopkins, after Hopkins suggested on Twitter that Monroe was supportive of vandalism of a war memorial, having confused Monroe with journalist Laurie Penny. Instead of apologising, Hopkins then labelled Monroe \"social anthrax\". The High Court awarded Monroe \u00a324,000 in damages plus costs.[48][49][50]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nCookery books[edit]\nA Girl Called Jack: 100 delicious budget recipes (Michael Joseph, 2014) ISBN\u00a09780718178949\nA Year in 120 Recipes (Michael Joseph, 2014) ISBN\u00a09780718179960\nCooking on a Bootstrap: Over 100 simple, budget recipes (Bluebird, 2018) ISBN\u00a09781509831111\nTin Can Cook: 75 Simple Store-cupboard Recipes (Bluebird, 2019) ISBN\u00a09781529015287\nVegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don't cost the earth (Bluebird, 2019) ISBN\u00a09781529005080[51]\nGood Food for Bad Days: What to Make When You're Feeling Blue (Bluebird, 2020) ISBN\u00a09781529028188\nSee also[edit]\nJack Monroeat Wikipedia's sister projectsMedia from Wikimedia Commons\nQuotations from Wikiquote\nData from Wikidata\n\n\nPoverty in the United Kingdom\nUnited Kingdom government austerity programme\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Monroe, Jack (7 May 2014). \"About Jack\".

In an April 2017 interview, Monsoon stated, \"I've never identified as fully male. I've always identified as more gender fluid or gender ambiguous, but I never knew the vocabulary to explain it for myself.\"[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\n Jinkx Monsoon, 2014\nAfter moving to Seattle from Portland, Hoffer and creative partner Nick Sahoyah wrote and starred in multiple Funny or Die webisodes titled Monsoon Season in which they played Jinkx Monsoon as an over-bearing, substance addled, near-psychotic mother to Nick Sahoyah's character, Kamikaze Monsoon.[13]\nIn 2011, Monsoon appeared in the Wes Hurley film Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel.[14][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] On February 28, 2013, the first screening at Seattle's Central Cinema was hosted by Monsoon and Waxie Moon.[15]\nIn January 2012, Hoffer appeared as Moritz in the rock musical Spring Awakening at the Balagan Theater in Seattle. Controversy arose from The Seattle Times review by Misha Berson, who said that Hoffer was \"overly flamboyant\" for the role.[16][17] Dan Savage defended Hoffer's portrayal of Moritz.[18] From July 21 to August 19, Hoffer starred as Angel in the 5th Avenue Theatre's production of the musical RENT.[8][19]\nIn January 2013, Hoffer played Hedwig in the Moore Theatre's production of the rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch.[20] Balagan reprised the production in December 2013 for a week long run with Hoffer and the original cast/production team.\nIn June 2013, Hoffer played Velma Von Tussle in the Seattle Men's Chorus/5th Avenue Theatre's production of the musical Hairspray .[21] This was a limited run staged reading/concert of the musical with costumes and limited props but no sets or elaborate choreography and featured the Seattle Men's Chorus onstage with the cast.\nHoffer also performs as Jinkx Monsoon in the original one act cabaret musical The Vaudevillians under the name \"Kitty Witless.\" Hoffer is accompanied by musical partner and co-creator Richard Andriessen, who performs under the name \"Dr. Dan Von Dandy.\" The Vaudevillians performed at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York City from July to November 2013.[1][22][23] After touring Australia with The Vaudevillians, Hoffer received a nomination for the Helpmann Award for Best Cabaret Performer.[24]\nIn 2013 Hoffer was chosen as one of the Artists of the Year by City Arts magazine along with Megan Griffiths, Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, and Wes Hurley.[25]\nHoffer played Tallulah/Dennis, the owner of Lipstick Lounge in an episode of Blue Bloods entitled \"Manhattan Queens\", which aired on January 31, 2014.\nIn December 2014, an animated version of Hoffer appeared in the \"RuPaul's Drag Race: Dragopolis 2.0\" mobile app.[26]\nIn 2015 Hoffer joined the cast of Wes Hurley's hit comedy series Capitol Hill.[27]\n\nDrag Becomes Him[edit]\nIn June 2011, Hoffer became subject to a YouTube docu-series by Alex Berry, a Seattle videographer. Named after Death Becomes Her, one of Jinkx's favorite movies, Drag Becomes Him explores Hoffer's life in and out of drag.[28] The series has continued since the finale of RuPaul's Drag Race and will offer insight into their life since the show.[29]\nIn October 2013 it was announced that Drag Becomes Him was being turned into a feature-length film with Seattle-based producer Basil Shadid on board. A Kickstarter campaign in March 2014 successfully raised funds to complete the project. On March 26, 2015, Hoffer announced on their Instagram page that the film would premiere at the Cinerama in Seattle on April 29, 2015.[30]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race[edit]\nIn November 2012, Logo announced that Jinkx Monsoon was among fourteen drag queens who would be competing on the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[31] Hoffer was inspired to audition after seeing Sharon Needles, another high-concept, character-driven drag queen, on the fourth season of the show.[3] Monsoon won the main-challenges for the episodes \"Snatch Game\" and \"Drama Queens.\"[32][33] For the \"Snatch Game,\" Monsoon impersonated Edith Bouvier Beale.[1][34] Monsoon also impersonated third-season contestant Mimi Imfurst in the episode \"Lip Synch Extravaganza Eleganza.\"[35] As part of RuPaul's Drag Race, Monsoon sang on the \"We Are the World\"-inspired song \"Can I Get an Amen?\" The song's proceeds helped benefit the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center.[36] Monsoon won RuPaul's Drag Race season 5.\n\nPolitics[edit]\nHoffer is very outspoken on their Instagram and Twitter about US President Donald Trump and LGBT equality. They are a Democrat supporter and donated to both Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders' campaigns to be the Democratic nominee for President.[37]\n\nArtistry[edit]\nHoffer's drag persona is inspired by their mother and the comedians Lucille Ball, Maria Bamford, Deven Green, and Sarah Silverman. Their drag persona's last name, Monsoon, is derived from the character Edina Monsoon from the British sitcom Absolutely Fabulous.[3] Hoffer also performs as the drag character Deirdre A. Irwin, who is a Southern medium.[9]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nStudio albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nDetails\n\n\nThe Inevitable Album[38]\n\n\nReleased: May 6, 2014\nLabel: Sidecar Records\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\n\nThe Ginger Snapped[39]\n\n\nReleased: January 12, 2018\nLabel: Producer Entertainment Group\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\nRemix albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nDetails\n\n\nReAnimated[40]\n\n\nReleased: October 13, 2015\nLabel: Sidecar Records, Producer Entertainment Group\nFormat: CD, Digital download\n\nCommentary albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nDetails\n\n\nThe Inevitable Commentary Album[41]\n\n\nReleased: July 2, 2014\nLabel: Sidecar Records, Producer Entertainment Group\nFormats: digital download\n\nSingles[edit]\n\n\nSong\n\nYear\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\"Coffee & Wine\"[42]\n\n2014\n\nThe Inevitable Album\n\n\n\"The Bacon Shake\"[43](featuring Fred Schneider)\n\n\n\"Creep\"[44]\n\n\n\"Hold On JMX (GlitterMix)\"(featuring Jean Morisoon)\n\n2015\n\nReAnimated\n\n\n\"Cartoons and Vodka\"\n\n2018\n\nThe Ginger Snapped\n\nFeatured singles[edit]\n\n\nSong\n\nYear\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\"Can I Get an Amen?\"(RuPaul featuring RuPaul's Drag Race Season 5 Cast)\n\n2013\n\nNon-album singles\n\n\n\"Schizophrenic\"[45](Two Dudes in Love featuring Jinkx Monsoon)\n\n\n\"Bring It\"[46](Manila Luzon featuring Jinkx Monsoon)\n\nOther appearances[edit]\n\n\nSong\n\nYear\n\nOther Artist(s)\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\"Red & Green\"\n\n2015\n\nN/A\n\nChristmas Queens\n\n\n\"Passive Aggressive Christmas\"\n\n2016\n\nMajor Scales\n\nChristmas Queens 2\n\n\n\"Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah\"\n\n2017\n\nN/A\n\nChristmas Queens 3\n\n\n\"The Auld Lang Syne Song\"\n\n\n\"Jingle Bell Rock\"\n\n2018\n\nN/A\n\nChristmas Queens 4\n\nMusic videos[edit]\n\n\nSong\n\nYear\n\nDirector\n\n\n\"Jinkxalicious\"[47]\n\n2011\n\nAlex Berry\n\n\n\"Coffee & Wine\"[48]\n\n2014\n\n\n\"The Bacon Shake\"[49]\n\nSteve Willis\n\n\n\"Creep\"[50]\n\n\n\"Hold On JMX (GlitterMix)\"[51]\n\n2015\n\n\n\"Red & Green\"[52]\n\nSantiago Felip\u00e9\n\n\n\"Cartoons & Vodka\"[53]\n\n2018\n\nMac Kerman\n\n\n\"Just Me (The Gender Binary Blues)\"[54]\n\nSantiago Felip\u00e9\n\n\n\"She Evil\"[55]\n\nBrad Hammer, Shawn Adeli\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\n\n2011\n\nWaxie Moon in Fallen Jewel\n\nThemself/Davey\n\n\n2013\n\nEast of Adin\n\nAnthony Johnson\n\n\n2014\n\nDrag Becomes Him\n\nThemself\n\n\n2019\n\nTrixie Mattel: Moving Parts\n\nThemself\n\n\n2019\n\nThe Queens[56]\n\nThemself\n\n\n2020\n\nHappiest Season\n\nEm K.

They are known for playing the role of Angel Evangelista in the FX television series Pose.[3] Time magazine named the actor one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019.[4] Moore is transgender and non-binary,[5][6] and uses they/them pronouns.[7][8][6]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Early work\n2.2 Pose television series\n2.3 Present projects\n2.4 Upcoming projects\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 Filmography\n\n4.1 Film\n4.2 Television\n4.3 Music videos\n\n\n5 Awards and Nominations\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nA Bronx native, Indya Moore is of Haitian, Puerto Rican, and Dominican ancestry.[9] At the age of 14, they left their parents' home due to their parents' transphobia, and entered into foster care.[10] They moved around frequently during this time, eventually living in all five boroughs of New York City. After being frequently bullied, Moore dropped out of high school during their sophomore year.[11] They began working as a model at the age of 15, and eventually earned their General Equivalency Diploma (GED).[11][12]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly work[edit]\nMoore became a model at the age of 15, and began working shoots for Dior and Gucci, despite the fashion industry's initial treatment of them as a risky choice.[11]\nAlthough Moore was booking modeling gigs, they became increasingly disenchanted with the fashion industry and its emphasis on body image. Moore met legendary dancer and ballroom veteran Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza while doing background for the television series The Get Down. He encouraged them to pursue acting and sent Moore to an audition for the independent film Saturday Church.[11] Moore landed the role of Dijon, and the film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival.[13] The Hollywood Reporter called it \"sweet and soulful\".[14] The film was later released on January 12, 2018 by Samuel Goldwyn Films.[15]\nIn early 2017, Moore walked in New York Fashion Week and was photographed for Vogue Espa\u00f1a. That year, Moore appeared in Katy Perry\u2019s music video for the single \u201cSwish Swish\u201d, and performed live with Perry on the May 20, 2017 episode of Saturday Night Live,[16][17][18] where they were credited as a member of the House of Xtravaganza.[19]\n\nPose television series[edit]\nIn late 2017, Moore was cast in Pose, Ryan Murphy's FX television series about New York City ball culture in the late 1980s.[20][13] Moore portrays Angel Evangelista, a transgender sex worker who joins the House of Evangelista after leaving the House of Abundance with her friend Blanca. While working at the piers, she meets Stan, a yuppie played by Evan Peters, and becomes his mistress.[21]\nThe series premiered on June 3, 2018, and attracted critical acclaim.[22][23] The first season boasted the largest cast of transgender actors ever for a scripted network series with over 50 transgender characters.[20][24] On July 12, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 11, 2019.[25]\n\nPresent projects[edit]\nIn 2018, Moore signed a contract with IMG Models and William Morris Endeavor (WME). Moore was WME's first signed contract with a trans actor.[26] Moore also started the production company Beetlefruit Media, which provides a platform for stories about disenfranchised groups.[27]\nMoore has appeared in J.View's 2017 \"Don't Pull Away\" music video, and in Blood Orange's 2018 \"Saint\" video.[28]\nIn May 2019, Moore became the first transgender person to be featured on the cover of the U.S. version of Elle magazine.[29]\nIn December 2019, Moore debuted as the voice of Shep on the animated limited series Steven Universe Future. The character is also non-binary.[30]\n\nUpcoming projects[edit]\nMoore will appear in the upcoming horror television series, Magic Hour, a gender-bending recreation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, directed by Che Grayson and filmed in Tokyo, on which they also serve as an executive producer.[21][31] Moore is set to appear in the short film Spot.[32] Moore has been cast in the sequel to the 2019 psychological thriller film Escape Room which is scheduled to be released on January 1, 2021.[33]\nIn June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, Queerty named them among the fifty heroes \u201cleading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people\u201d.[34][35]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMoore is transgender[36] and non-binary[5][6] and goes by they/them pronouns.[7][8][6] Moore has spoken openly about their lifelong struggles with the bullying and transphobia that caused them to leave home at 14 and drop out of school in the 10th grade.[10]\nIn an interview with Pose co-star, Mj Rodriguez, Moore discussed how, despite identifying as non-binary, being seen as a woman means they are still subjected to the same  \"surveillance and scrutiny\" as women, and to a desire to use fashion to take back that power:[5]\n\nMOORE: I feel like that about fashion. I feel like that about us having the autonomy to express ourselves. I'm non-binary but I don't really talk about it that much. I don't feel like people really are there yet for understanding it, which I don't mind, but I also acknowledge the way people see me as a woman. And because I'm seen as a woman, a cis woman or binary presenting, people are  going to hold me up to those same standards that women are held up to.\nRODRIGUEZ: Which you're saying you shouldn't be, right?\n\nMOORE: Which I'm saying women should not be.[5]\nIn December 2018, Moore came out as polyamorous.[37][38]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2017\n\nSaturday Church\n\nDijon\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nSpot\n\nBusinesswoman\n\nShort film\n\n\n2019\n\nQueen & Slim\n\nGoddess\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nThe One\n\nDr. Watkins\n\nShort film\n\n\n2020\n\nMagic Hour\n\nBella\n\nShort film; also executive producer\n\n\n2020\n\nA Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting\n\nPeggy Drood\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\nEscape Room 2\n\nTBA\n\nPost-production\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2018\u2013present\n\nPose\n\nAngel Evangelista\n\n18 episodes\n\n\n2019\n\nSteven Universe Future\n\nShep\n\nEpisode: \"Little Graduation\" (voice acting role)\n\n\nMusic videos[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nArtist\n\n\n2017\n\n\"Don't Pull Away\"\n\nLead Girl\n\nJ.Views (ft.

He wrote the musical stage show The Rocky Horror Show in 1973, which has remained in almost continuous production. He also co-wrote the screenplay of the film adaptation, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), appearing in the film as Riff Raff, which became an international success and has received a large cult following. O'Brien wrote Shock Treatment (1981) and appeared in the film as Dr. Cosmo McKinley. \nO'Brien presented four series of the Channel 4 game show The Crystal Maze (1990\u20131993, 2016). He played the voice role of Lawrence Fletcher in the Disney Channel animated series Phineas and Ferb (2007\u20132015) and its two films (2011 and 2020). He has also appeared in the films Dark City (1998), Ever After (1998), Dungeons & Dragons (2000), Elvira's Haunted Hills (2001), and Jackboots on Whitehall (2010). After a long and successful career based in the United Kingdom, O'Brien gained dual citizenship with New Zealand in 2011, where he resided in Tauranga.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Later career\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 Awards and nominations\n\n4.1 Awards\n4.2 Nominations\n\n\n5 Filmography\n6 Theatre credits\n7 Discography\n\n7.1 Singles\n\n\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nO'Brien was born Richard Smith in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He emigrated with his family to Tauranga, New Zealand, at the age of 10, where his accountant father had purchased a sheep farm. He went to Tauranga Boys' College. He returned to England in 1964, after having learned how to ride horses (a skill which provided him with his break into the film industry as a stuntman in Carry On Cowboy)[4] and developing a keen interest in comic books and horror films. He launched his acting career using his maternal grandmother's name,[citation needed] as there was already an actor named Richard Smith.\nHe says that his time in New Zealand instilled him with a sense of egalitarianism and gave him \"a great sense of freedom\".[5]\n\nCareer[edit]\nTo improve his acting skills, O'Brien took method acting classes, and then joined several stage productions as an actor. In 1970, he went into the touring production of Hair for nine months, and spent another nine months in the London production.[6] In the summer of 1972, he met director Jim Sharman who cast him as an Apostle and Leper in the London production of Jesus Christ Superstar. Sharman then cast O'Brien as Willie, the alien in his March 1973 production of Sam Shepard's The Unseen Hand at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs.[7]\nSharman also helped make O'Brien's draft of a gothic-themed, schlock-horror comic-book fantasy romp into a reality. Sharman suggested changing the working title from They Came from Denton High, and The Rocky Horror Show opened at the Theatre Upstairs in June 1973.[8] Within weeks it had become a box-office hit, moving from the Royal Court to the Pheasantry, a nearby venue in the King's Road, then to the Classic Cinema and eventually into the West End at the Comedy Theatre.\nAfter seeing the second night's performance of The Rocky Horror Show in the Theatre Upstairs, Jonathan King produced the original cast soundtrack in just over 48 hours during an off-stage weekend, and rushed it out on his UK Records label. He also became a 20% backer with producer Michael White, who put up the remaining 80%.[9]\nDuring this period, O'Brien and his wife Kimi Wong recorded and released pop singles under the name Kimi and Ritz.[10]\n\nLater career[edit]\nO'Brien continued writing musicals with arranger Richard Hartley, including: T. Zee (1976), Disaster (1978), The Stripper (1982 \u2013 based on the Carter Brown novel and produced in Australia), and Top People (1984). O'Brien and Hartley also provided three songs for the film The Return of Captain Invincible (1983), starring Alan Arkin. O'Brien wrote his one-man revue Disgracefully Yours (1985) singing as Mephistopheles Smith.\nO'Brien has appeared in Jubilee (1977), Flash Gordon (1980), Dark City (1998), Ever After (1998) and Dungeons & Dragons (2000), among others. Additionally he guest starred in five episodes in the third series of the HTV dramatisation of Robin of Sherwood, as the corrupt druid Gulnar. A music CD of the songs from Disgracefully Yours entitled Absolute O'Brien was released in 1998.[11]\nHe became the presenter of UK Channel 4's game show The Crystal Maze in 1990,[12] specialising in sardonic put-downs, occasional eccentricities and playing his harmonica at random intervals. The show ran from 1990 to 1995, with O'Brien presenting the first four series. It was regularly Channel 4's highest-rated programme, reaching a peak of 7\u00a0million viewers for the 1993 Christmas special. O'Brien left The Crystal Maze in 1993 after the fourth series; the show was then taken over by Edward Tudor-Pole. After two series without O'Brien, the show was cancelled.[citation needed]\nIn other roles O'Brien has conceptualised and played the role of the Child Catcher in the West End theatre production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.[12] He also occasionally performs cabaret-style music and comedy on stages around the world, singing songs from Rocky Horror among others. In 1995, he performed a select number of shows as the devilish charmer Mephistopheles Smith in a musical/comedy show he wrote entitled Disgracefully Yours, to which he later gave permission to be adapted into a musical, first by Eubank Productions for the Kansas City Fringe Fest in 2006, and more recently by Janus Theatre Company for the Edinburgh Fringe 2007, simply entitled Mephistopheles Smith. In late 2005, he appeared (as the spirit of the mirror) in the pantomime version of Snow White, which played at the Milton Keynes Theatre. In the summer of 2006, he played the Child Catcher in the Queen's 80th birthday celebrations at Buckingham Palace.\nO'Brien performed in Thank-You for the Music, a 90-minute ABBA documentary for ITV, directed by Martin Koch, who previously directed the musical Mamma Mia![13] The documentary included a remake of the mini musical '\"The Girl with the Golden Hair\" which ABBA performed during their 1977 world tour and featured on ABBA: The Album (also 1977). The musical was performed at the Prince of Wales Theatre and featured Richard O'Brien, Liz McClarnon and the Dynamos.[13] He also hosted the 1993 Brit Awards.\nA patron of the Five Stars Scanner Appeal,[14] which benefits the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. From 2001-06 he hosted the annual Transfandango,[15] gala gathering of Dearhearts and Trans 'n' Gentle People to raise money for the hospital. This has now been superseded by Richard O'Brien's Halloween Party.\nA script for another rumoured sequel entitled Revenge of the Old Queen of Rocky Horror, has been circulated on the web and reproduced on various fan sites, although it has been officially denied as O'Brien's work by his representatives. While he has worked on a screenplay by that title, it was never publicly released. He wrote the lyrics for The Stripper (based on the book by Carter Brown), a musical which had its British premiere at the Queen's Theatre in Hornchurch, London on 28 August 2009.[16]\nIn 2004, members of the Hamilton City Council in New Zealand honoured O'Brien's contribution to the arts with a statue of Riff Raff, the character he played in The Rocky Horror Show, on the site of the former Embassy Cinema.[17]\n\n O'Brien in 2006\nO'Brien was denied New Zealand citizenship in June, 2010, and so could himself not settle in the country. He commented, \"They build a statue of me and celebrate me as a New Zealander, but I have to go on my knees and do all sorts of things, and I'm probably too old.\"[18] O'Brien did eventually become a New Zealand citizen, in December 2011.[3]\nIn September 2007, he reprised his role as the Child Catcher for the final two weeks of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang's five-year British run, and then played the role in its Singapore engagement for the month of November, extended to 9 December. Also in December, he visited Hamilton, New Zealand for An Evening With Richard O'Brien, with presenter Mark Sainsbury and director Fiona Jackson.\"Fiona Jackson\". Retrieved 10 March 2016.[19]\nIn December 2008, O'Brien donated his original script Pig in Boots to the Wireless Theatre Company,[20] who converted it into an audio pantomime. The show was recorded live at the Headliners Comedy Club in front of a studio audience with live FX and music. The production was opened by an original interview with O'Brien. In October 2012, O'Brien judged \"Stage Fright\" with the Wireless Theatre Company as part of the London Horror Festival and performed an acoustic set of Rocky Horror songs.[21]\nIn March 2012, he gave a performance of song and autobiographical stories, It's Party Time with Richard O'Brien at the Hamilton Founders Theatre to celebrate his 70th birthday. In June 2012, he returned to Hamilton, New Zealand, to appear on stage as Fagin with the Hamilton Operatic Society's production of Oliver! at the Founders Theatre.[22]\nO'Brien appeared in 2015 in The Rocky Horror Show in the West End in a limited 11-performance run.[23]\nIn September 2016 O'Brien opened the second stage Embassy Park in Hamilton together with Mayor Julie Hardaker.[24] In October 2016, he appeared as the Crystal Maze Computer in a one-off Celebrity Crystal Maze episode for the charity 'Stand Up To Cancer' on Channel 4.[25]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn a 2009 interview, O'Brien spoke about an ongoing struggle to reconcile cultural gender roles and described himself as transgender or \"of a third sex\".[4] O'Brien stated, \"There is a continuum between male and female. Some are hard-wired one way or another, I\u2019m in between.\"[26] He expounded on this in a 2013 interview where he talked about using estrogen for the previous decade, and that he views himself as 70% male and 30% female.[27] In 2017, O'Brien came under controversy when he said that he supported the statements of Germaine Greer and Barry Humphries about that transgender women were not real women, though O'Brien offered his sympathy to the trans community.[28] In a 2020 interview with The Guardian, O'Brien was reported as stating \"I think anybody who decides to take the huge step with a sex change deserves encouragement and a thumbs-up. As long as they\u2019re happy and fulfilled, I applaud them to my very last day. But you can\u2019t ever become a natural woman\".[4]\nIn June 2010, the media reported that O'Brien had been denied New Zealand citizenship owing to his being too old under the country's immigration criteria. O'Brien's application appeared to garner public support and the decision was later overturned on appeal.[18] In August 2010, New Zealand's Dominion Post reported that O'Brien would be allowed residency and possibly citizenship as an \"exceptional\" case.[29] According to the Waikato Times, he was officially registered as a New Zealand citizen on 14 December 2011.[3]\nOn 16 August 2010, he appeared on an episode of Celebrity Cash in the Attic, where he donated the takings from his sale of memorabilia to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester.\nO'Brien has married three times and has three children. He and actress Kimi Wong were married on 4 December 1971 and had a son Linus in May 1972. He has a son and daughter from his second marriage to designer Jane Moss.\nOn 7 July 2012, aged 70, he proposed to Sabrina Graf, aged 35, a native of Germany, whom he had been dating for three years.[30] They married on 6 April 2013 at their home in Katikati, Bay of Plenty.[31][32]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\nAwards[edit]\n1998: Berlin International Film Festival Award - Special Teddy (for The Rocky Horror Picture Show)\n2000: Gaylactic Spectrum Award (for The Rocky Horror Picture Show)\nNominations[edit]\n1974: Grammy Award - Best Score (for The Rocky Horror Show)[33]\n1989: Independent Spirit Award - Best Writer (for The Rocky Horror Picture Show)\n1999: Fangoria Chainsaw Award - Best Supporting Actor (for Dark City)\n2001: Tony Award (for Revival)\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1965\n\nCarry On Cowboy\n\nRider\n\n\n\n\n1971\n\nZee and Co.\n\nParty guest\n\nUncredited, opening scene\n\n\n1972\n\nFour Dimensions of Greta\n\n\n\nUncredited\n\n\n1975\n\nCaribe\n\nGeneral Desmond\n\n1 episode\n\n\n1975\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\n\nRiff Raff\n\nAlso co-writer\n\n\n1977\n\nJubilee\n\nJohn Dee\n\n\n\n\n1978\n\nThe Odd Job\n\nBatch\n\n\n\n\n1980\n\nFlash Gordon\n\nFico\n\n\n\n\n1981\n\nShock Treatment\n\nDr. Cosmo McKinley\n\nAlso writer\n\n\n1983\n\nDigital Dream\n\nPartige the Surrey Servant\n\nTelevision film\n\n\n1985\n\nRevolution\n\nLord Hampton\n\n\n\n\n1986\n\nRoland Rat, the Series\n\n\n\n1 episode, uncredited\n\n\n1986\n\nRobin of Sherwood\n\nGulnar\n\nRecurring role\n\n\n1989\n\nThe Wolves of Willoughby Chase\n\nJames\n\n\n\n\n1990-1993, 2016\n\nThe Crystal Maze\n\nPresenter\n\n\n\n\n1993\n\nFull Stretch\n\n\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n1994\n\nThe Ink Thief\n\nThe Ink Thief\n\n\n\n\n1995\n\nThe Detectives\n\nDr. Phibes/Police Mortician\n\n\n\n\n1997\n\nSpice World\n\nDamien\n\n\n\n\n1998\n\nEver After\n\nPierre Le Pieu\n\n\n\n\n1998\n\nDark City\n\nMr. Hand\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\nDungeons & Dragons (film)\n\nXilus\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\nUrban Gothic\n\nThin man\n\n1 episode\n\n\n2001\n\nElvira's Haunted Hills\n\nLord Vladimere Hellsubus\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\nCold Case\n\nHimself\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n2006\n\nThe Ten Commandments\n\nAnander\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n2008-2015\n\nPhineas and Ferb\n\nLawrence Fletcher\n\nVoice role\n\n\n2009\n\nNight Train\n\nMrs Froy\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nJackboots on Whitehall\n\nHimmler\n\nVoice role\n\n\n2011\n\nPhineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension\n\nLawrence Fletcher\n\nVoice role\n\n\n2011\n\nMongrels\n\nZombie Dog\n\nSeries 2, episode 2\n\n\n2013\n\nJustin and the Knights of Valour\n\nInnkeeper/Baker\n\nVoice role\n\n\n2017\n\nThe Stolen\n\nMr. Russell\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nThe Barefoot Bandits\n\nVarney\n\nVoice role\n\n\n2020\n\nPhineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe\n\nLawrence Fletcher\n\nVoice role\n\nTheatre credits[edit]\nHair (1970), UK tour\nJesus Christ Superstar (1972), West End theatre[34]\nThe Rocky Horror Show (1973), at The Royal Court Theatre Upstairs\nThe Unseen Hand (1973), at The Royal Court Theatre Upstairs\nThe Rocky Horror Show (1974), at King\u2019s Road Theatre\nThe Rocky Horror Show (1975), Belasco Theatre, New York\nThank You for the Music (1977), at the Prince of Wales Theatre\nEastward Hoe (1981), at the Mermaid Theatre\nDisgracefully Yours (1985), in London\nThe News (1985), at the London City Theatre\nLittle Shop of Horrors (1986), at Soho Theatre\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (2004\u20132005), West End theatre[35]\nSnow White (2005), at Milton Keynes Theatre\nThe Rocky Horror Tribute Show (2006), at The Royal Court Theatre\nDirty Dancing (2006), West End theatre[36]\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (2006), at the Royal Variety Performance for the Queen's 80th birthday celebrations at Buckingham Palace\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (2007), Singapore tour\nThe Stripper (2009), at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch\nOliver!

They subsequently accessed their own medical records, and learned the truth about their condition.[7][5] In 2020, they learned that their AIS diagnosis was incorrect and that they have another intersex variation, as their low levels of estrogen and osteopenia might have indicated.[8][9]\nPagonis graduated from DePaul with bachelor's and master's degrees in women and gender studies.[1]\n\nActivism[edit]\nPagonis joined the advocacy organization interACT a few years after discovering they were intersex.[7] They became the leadership coordinator of the youth program at interACT.[7] In 2013, Pagonis testified with Mauro Cabral, Natasha Jim\u00e9nez and Paula Sandrine Machado before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights about the medical interventions they were subjected to as an intersex child.[10][11] They were also featured in the 2012 documentary Intersexion.[1]\nIn 2014, Pagonis created a documentary of their own, The Son They Never Had: Growing Up Intersex, which they tour around the country, advocating against nonconsensual \"corrective surgeries\".[1][12] This work was published in a bioethics journal, Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics.[13][14] The Son They Never Had was also shown at the Leeds Queer Film Festival in the UK in March 2017.[15]\nIn 2015, Pagonis created the hashtag campaign #intersexstories for Intersex Awareness Day. The campaign attracted a huge following, with many intersex people sharing their stories.[2][16] Pagonis also appeared in a BuzzFeed video about intersex bodies, identities and experiences.[17][18]\nPagonis is a writer for Everyday Feminism, where they have addressed subjects including anti-black racism in the intersex community, interviewing Sean Saifa Wall and Lynnell Stephani Long ,[19] and debate over the inclusion of intersex people in the LGBTQA acronym.[6]\nPagonis appeared in a 2016 episode of the television series Transparent. They lobbied for the part when meeting show creator Jill Soloway at a White House awards ceremony.[4]\nPagonis appeared on the cover of the January 2017 National Geographic \"Gender Revolution\" issue. They were one of the intersex activists who wrote in expressing concern that being intersex was defined by the magazine as a disorder. National Geographic responded to reader pressure by updating the definition in the online issue.[20][21]\nIn June 2017, Pagonis appeared in a video for Teen Vogue alongside fellow intersex advocates Emily Quinn and Hanne Gaby Odiele, explaining what it means to be intersex.[22]\n\nAwards and recognition[edit]\nPagonis was one of nine LGBT artists honored as an Obama White House Champion of Change in 2015.[23] They were also one of \"30 Under 30\" honored by the Windy City Times in 2013.[3]\n\nSelected bibliography[edit]\nPagonis, Pidgeon (April 2017). \"First Do Harm: How Intersex Kids Are Hurt by those Who Have Taken the Hippocratic Oath\".

Rostron then enrolled in an Art school in Sheffield before moving to Berlin in 2002. In 2004, they launched their label Rostron Records with Planningtorock's EP Eins, following it in 2005 with a compilation LP  Carousel of Souls that featured songs from The Knife and The Soft Pink Truth.[2] They sang backing vocals on the Badly Drawn Boy track \"Outside is a Light 2\", a B-Side from the 1999 single \"It Came From the Ground\".[3]\n\n2006\u20132009: Have It All[edit]\n Performing in Munich in 2007\nAfter signing to Chicks on Speed's record label in 2006, Planningtorock released the limited edition 7\" single \"Changes/I Wanna Bite Ya\", before their debut album was released the following summer.[4]\nIn 2006, Planningtorock remixed the song \"Marble House\" by The Knife.[5]\n\n2010\u20132011: Tomorrow, In a Year and W[edit]\nIn 2010, Planningtorock collaborated with The Knife and Mount Sims to write an opera for the Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma. The opera, titled Tomorrow, In a Year, is based on Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Tomorrow, In a Year was later released on 9 March 2010, by Mute Records and received generally favourable reviews from contemporary critics; according to the music review aggregation of Metacritic, it garnered an average score of 67/100.[6]\nRostron worked as the sound designer and componist for the Bruce LaBruce film The Bad Breast; or, The Strange Case of Theda Lange in 2010.[7]\nRostron began correspondence with James Murphy after he sent them a fan email that said 'Really like the Planningtorock stuff \u2013 just saying.\" Murphy later invited them on LCD Soundsystem's Sound of Silver tour before signing them to his label DFA Records. Planningtorock co-wrote the song \"Answering Machine\" from the album From the Cradle to the Rave by DFA label-mate Shit Robot in 2010.[8] DFA released Rostron's second studio album W on 17 May 2011.[9] Rostron had been working on the album's songs since 2007, eventually writing more than 27 songs.[10] W received positive reviews from contemporary critics; according to the music review aggregation of Metacritic, it garnered an average score of 72/100.[11] The album included a cover of Arthur Russell's song \"Janine.\"\n\n2012\u20132013: EPs and All Love's Legal[edit]\nIn an interview with Resident Advisor, Rostron stated: 'Last summer after touring W, I had a bit of a creative meltdown and wasn't sure about making music any more\u2014then I wrote \"Patriarchy Over And Out,\" and suddenly the goal of the next album became clear'. During this period Rostron legally changed their name from Janine to Jam so as to have a non-gendered name. They also revealed that in the Spring of 2012 they set up a studio space with Olof Dreijer (of The Knife), Hermione Frank (AKA Roxymore) and Paula Temple.[12]\nRostron states that \"Patriarchy Over And Out\" was a turning point 'which was the beginning of being more direct and experimenting with being more political'.[13]\nOn 8 March 2013 Rostron released Misogyny Drop Dead EP[14] and in mid-July released a vinyl-only remix of \"Full of Fire\" by The Knife \"Let's Talk About Gender Baby\".[15]\nOn 29 October 2013 Rostron announced a third studio album All Love's Legal[16] along with a music video for its opening track \"Welcome\".[17]\n\n2018-present: Powerhouse[edit]\nOn 31 August 2018, Rostron released, \"Transome\", as the lead single from their fourth studio album, Powerhouse. It was followed by a second album track, Much To Touch on 12 October 2018. Both were released via Human Level / DFA Records.\nRostron identifies as genderqueer and non-binary, using singular they pronouns.[18] Powerhouse includes several tracks in which they sing about their family and childhood in Bolton, England. The title track is a tribute to Rostron\u2019s mother: \u2018She\u2019s basically the powerhouse of the record. It was the hardest track to write, to pin down and express my love and adoration for my mum, because there\u2019s so many things that she\u2019s done for me, for the family, for my sister. She\u2019s the powerhouse, for sure.\u2019[19]\n\nArtistry[edit]\nPlanningtorock has stated that the distortion of their vocals allows for the \"playing around with gender alongside communicating what I feel is the emotions within the songs. Because I am really interested in expanding upon the limits that we live in \u2013 how we are defined \u2013 and it is an experiment.\"[10]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nStudio albums[edit]\nHave It All (2006)\nW (2011)\nAll Love's Legal (2014)\nPowerhouse (2018)\nCollaborations[edit]\nTomorrow, In a Year (with The Knife and Mount Sims) (2010) No. 79 Belgium (Flanders), No. 24 Sweden, No. 10 US Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums, No. 32 US Billboard Heatseekers Albums\nExtended plays[edit]\nEins (2004)\nTopics on a Foreign Mind (2004)\nHave It All Stringed Up (2006)\nMisogyny Drop Dead EP (2013)\nMixtapes[edit]\nRA.266 (2011) (for Resident Advisor)[20]\nSingles[edit]\n\"Changes\" / \"I Wanna Bite Ya\" (2005)\n\"Doorway\" (2011)\n\"The Breaks\" (2011)\n\"Living It Out\" (2011)\n\"Patriarchy Over & Out\" (2012)\n\"Misogyny Drop Dead\" (2013)\n\"Human Drama\" (2014)\n\"Transome\" (2018)\n\"Much To Touch (2018)\nRemixes[edit]\nThe Knife \u2013 \"Heartbeats\" (2005)\nThe Knife \u2013 \"Marble House\" (2006)\nTelepathe \u2013 \"Devil's Trident\" (2008)\nAustra \u2013 \"Lose It\" (2011)\nCREEP featuring Nina Sky \u2013 \"You\" (2011)\nVicious Circle \u2013 \"Cerebre\" (2012)\nThe Knife \u2013 '\"Let's Talk About Gender Baby, Let's Talk About You And Me\" (Full of Fire Rework)\nRobyn - Ever Again (2019)\nZhala - Holes (2020)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Williams, Holly (9 February 2014). \"Planningtorock interview: 'A song about patriarchy saved my ass'\".

Pureka has received positive reviews in the long-running radical feminist publication off our backs[4] and other magazines. Their music does not deal explicitly with LGBTQ or political issues, focusing instead on emotional interactions between individuals.[5] They are a pescetarian.[6]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Musical career\n3 Personal life\n4 Discography\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nRaised in Connecticut,[1] they began writing songs at the age of eight and began playing the guitar at 16.[1] They soon became a frequent performer at local coffee houses and open mics. As a young performer, they opened shows for such artists as Erin McKeown and Pamela Means while completing a degree in biology at Wesleyan University.[1] After graduating, they worked in a microbiology research lab at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, eventually leaving to focus on music full-time.\n\nMusical career[edit]\nIn June 2001, they recorded a self-titled seven-song EP in preparation for a three-month nationwide tour with lesbian folk poet Alix Olson.[1] The EP, which was home-recorded in two weeks and featured Pureka playing back-up accompaniment on the mandolin and bass, was later mastered and reprinted for the 2005 summer tour.\nIn 2004, Pureka released Driving North, their first full-length album, earning rave reviews from fans and fellow artists alike. In 2006, they released Dryland, and toured the US a second time as a headlining act. The album received rave reviews and was featured on the Paste Magazine Sampler in February 2007.\nIn May 2007, Pureka was a member of the month-long New American Songwriter Tour in New York City, Philadelphia, and Massachusetts. The tour also featured Krystle Warren, Jesse Harris, and Ryan Scott.[7] In August, they played at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival.\nIn July 2007, Pureka's song, \"Swann Song\" won 1st Place in the Acoustic competition on the independent music site Ourstage.com.[8] Because of their performance there, they won a spot to perform at the Virgin Music Festival in Baltimore, Maryland, and performed there on August 5.[citation needed] Pureka had previously also won the Acoustic competition in April for their song \"31 and Falling\".[9]\nIn October 2007, they were nominated for 2007's Outstanding Folk Act by the Boston Music Awards. They were also awarded an ASCAPLUS award in the summer of 2007.\nPureka sold over 7000 copies of their 2010 album, How I Learned to See in the Dark, independently, on their own label, Sad Rabbit Music, which they founded. During this time, they gained popularity by performing with artists such as Dar Williams, The Cowboy Junkies, Peter Mulvey, Ani Difranco, Martin Sexton, Jeffrey Foucault, Kris Delmhorst, Melissa Ferrick, Catie Curtis, and Girlyman.\nPureka has been compared to artists like early Bruce Springsteen, Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin, Gillian Welch, and Mary Gauthier. They covered Welch's song \"Everything Is Free\" on Dryland and has expressed admiration for her music as well as that of Griffin. Pureka cites influences from Peter Mulvey and Pamela Means, as well as Ani DiFranco, but says that their own music differs greatly from DiFranco's often-outspoken political messages. Pureka has lent vocals and guitar playing to several tracks by artists like Alix Olson and Arjuna Greist; a notable track is \"Checking My Pulse\" with Olson, which went on to become a relative hit for Olson.\nOn January 20, 2009, Pureka released a fourth album, an EP entitled Chimera. The EP has seven tracks; one new, original song (with a prelude as the first track), a reworked studio version of a song off of their 2001 EP, three live tracks, and a cover of Bob Dylan and Ketch Secor's Wagon Wheel. The hard copy of Chimera is complete with written commentary from Pureka on each track.\nIn April 2010, Pureka released their fifth album, How I Learned To See in the Dark, which they co-produced with Merrill Garbus.[10][11][12][13]\nIn 2012 Pureka released a live album recorded at the Grey Eagle in Asheville, NC on January 19, 2011. It was recorded by Marsellus Fariss and mastered by Mark Alan Miller. Other musicians on the recording are: Andrea Alseri, Sebastian Renfield, Julia Read and Jax Keating.\nIn 2016 Pureka released their first new music since 2013 with the album Back in the Ring.[14][15]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAfter their 2010 album release and a move to New York City, Pureka suffered from writer's block and emotional exhaustion.[16] At the end of 2012, Pureka moved to Portland, Oregon.[14]\n\nDiscography[edit]\n2001 \u2013 Chris Pureka EP\n2004 \u2013 Driving North\n2006 \u2013 Dryland\n2009 \u2013 Chimera (EP)\n2010 \u2013 How I Learned To See in the Dark\n2012 \u2013 Chris Pureka Live at the Grey Eagle 1.19.11\n2013 \u2013 Chimera II (EP)\n2016 \u2013 Back in the Ring\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f Swartz, Shauna (June 11, 2007). \"7 Out Musicians to Watch\u00a0\u2014 Chris Pureka\".

You can say it. That\u2019s where I\u2019m from.\u201d[7] His mother owned a drag bar in Columbus, Georgia. On the nights that she could not afford a babysitter, she brought Tidicue to the drag bar, where he would work and collect money from the patrons.[8]\nTidicue has described his mother as a supportive early influence on his life. He explained, \"I also grew up with a mom who told me I could do anything, so I was like, 'Y'all don't even know how amazing I am.' My mom was one of the moms who was like, 'You are so handsome why aren't you modeling? I am handsome, but model... let's not get crazy.\"[8]\nAs a teenager, Tidicue attended Morrow High School. He then went on to study theater at Columbus State University.[7]\nWhen Tidicue was 22 years old, he moved to New York City with $500 and two suitcases. He originally intended to become an actor and standup comedian.[8][7] Before becoming a drag queen, Tidicue worked in children's theater for years and \"always found children to be a source of joy for [him].\"[9] He is also an LGBT activist and spoke on RuPaul's Drag Race of a moment when he was protesting for LGBT rights and was arrested in drag.[10]\nHe is the drag mother of Miz Cracker[11] and drag sister to Mon\u00e9t X Change,[12] who placed fifth and sixth, respectively, on season 10 of RuPaul's Drag Race, with X Change going on to win RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars season 4, along with Trinity Taylor, and Cracker placing as runner-up on RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars season 5, along with Jujubee, losing to Shea Coule\u00e9.\n\nCareer[edit]\nDrag career beginnings[edit]\nIn the summer of 2009, Tidicue started doing drag, after watching the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race on Tivo. He explained that he \"became obsessed\" with the show, and it immediately inspired him to order a TK-7 makeup kit off of the Ben Nye website. Since his first presentations, his character was focused on stand-up comedy routines, and he started lip-syncing after a couple of months into his drag.[13][7][14] His initial stage name was Kittin Withawhip, which was a reference to Kitten with a Whip (1964), a film that starred Ann-Margret. He was featured in Leland Bobb\u00e9's Half Drag Series with his name.[15][8] In his early drag career, Tidicue would perform with a nine-foot bullwhip.[8]\nIn the beginning of his career, Tidicue faced challenges as a drag queen. As he described, \"It did not make me money or get me gigs. It cost me a lot. I did this competition every Thursday. Then another one on Wednesday. And another on Tuesday. I never won any of them. Ever. After a few years, I finally won one. It was really addictive and fun doing competitions.\"[7]\nIn 2013, Tidicue officially changed his stage name to Bob the Drag Queen.[16] As they explained, at a karaoke hosting gig, \"The guy goes, 'Give it up for your host... Kate. But she made light of the moment, reintroducing herself as 'Kate the Drag Queen,' then 'Kim the Drag Queen' throughout the evening. Then at the end of the night, I was like, 'Give it up for... Bob the Drag Queen.' And I was like, 'That sounds really funny.'\"[8]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 8[edit]\nOn February 1, 2016, Bob was revealed as a cast member on the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[17] On the show, he was noted for his  focus on comedy. During the show, he won three challenges, including the recurring \"Snatch Game\" (where they portrayed Uzo Aduba and Carol Channing). On May 16, 2016, Bob was crowned the winner of the season and received a cash prize of $100,000.[3]\n\nOther ventures[edit]\nIn 2016, shortly after winning Drag Race, Bob released the single \"Purse First\" featuring DJ Mitch Ferrino. Also in 2016, he appeared in the music video for MC Frontalot's \"Mornings Come and Go\". He also collaborated with Alaska Thunderfuck on the single \"Yet Another Dig\" in 2017,[18] and contributed to the compilation album Christmas Queens 3 (2017).[19] He collaborated with Shangela for a Christmas theme song, \"Deck A Ho\" in December 2017.[20]\nOn March 15, 2018, Bob debuted the podcast Sibling Rivalry with his drag sister Mon\u00e9t X Change as co-host and produced by DJ Mitch Ferrino.[21] On April 2, 2018, a video version of the podcast was uploaded to YouTube.[22]\nBob appeared as a guest co-host alongside Trixie Mattel on The Trixie & Katya Show, filling in for regular co-host Katya during her hiatus.[23] Their TV comedy special, Bob the Drag Queen: Suspiciously Large Woman, aired on Logo in July 2017.[24]\nTidicue played the role of Belize in Berkeley Rep\u2019s production of Angels in America from April to July 2018.[25]\nIn November 2019, Tidicue was interviewed by KMVT about a one-time drag event hosted in Twin Falls, a show highlighting local drag queens and introducing international drag talent to Magic Valley.[26]\nBob's second comedy special, Bob The Drag Queen: Crazy Black Lady, will air on OutTV in Canada in 2020.[27]\nBob also writes jokes for other drag queens including Trinity Taylor, Ginger Minj, and Monet X Change.[28]\nOn March 5 and 6, 2020, Tidicue performed alongside fellow drag race alumni Bebe Zahara Benet, The Vixen, Monique Heart, Peppermint, and Shea Coule\u00e9 in the Nubia tour, a live drag show featuring and produced by Black drag queens.[29][30]\nOn June 14 2020, it was announced that along with Peppermint, they were hosting the first Black Queer Town Hall between June 19-21, in association with GLAAD and New York Pride.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nTidicue identifies as pansexual and non-binary[31] and goes by either he/him or she/her pronouns.[32]\nTidicue is polyamorous and has two partners: photographer Jacob Ritts and musician Ezra Michel.[33]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSingles[edit]\nAs lead

Roberts (sometimes credited as Lacey Jane Roberts) is an American textile artist. Roberts, who is genderqueer and uses singular they pronouns,[4] explores queer and feminist politics in their work.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n\n1.1 Early life\n1.2 Education\n\n\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 Works\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nEarly life[edit]\nRoberts grew up in a suburb of Detroit,[4][5] and they were initially taught to knit by their grandmother at age seven.[5] At thirteen, they left home and moved in with another family.[6] As a teenager, they were sent to an Episcopal all-girls boarding school in Maryland despite being Jewish,[6] at a time when they were \"dykey, angry, rebellious\" and \"grappling with [their] own sexuality and gender\".[3] In 1996, they viewed the AIDS Memorial Quilt in Washington D.C.; this was the first time they'd seen \"queer lexicon and militancy\".[5] Roberts was then sent to a boarding school in California in an attempt to \"feminize\" their behavior and dress.[3]\n\nEducation[edit]\nRoberts attended college at the University of Vermont, where they resumed knitting after suffering a severe injury that limited their access to facilities.[4][5]  In 2003 they created their first activist textile piece, dropping a hand-knit pink triangular banner from the campus church steeple that read \"Mom Knows Now\"; this served both as their coming out and as an homage to ACT UP activism against AIDS.[4][5]  Roberts graduated from the University of Vermont with bachelor's degrees in English and studio art.[4]\nRoberts then attended the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, doing further artivism there by knitting the words \"& Crafts\" and installing them on signs for the school, which had recently dropped \"and Crafts\" from its name. This work was later recreated to become a part of the collection at the Oakland Museum of California.[4] Roberts graduated from CCA with a Master of Arts in visual and critical studies and a Master of Fine Arts in textiles.[4][7]\n\nCareer[edit]\nRoberts's work consists primarily of large-scale installations knitted with children's toy knitting cranks including sock making machines and Barbie knitting tools. [8][3][9]  Throughout their career, Roberts has been most influenced by activist art about HIV/AIDS, and uses their craft as a form of activism as well.[6]  Their current artist's statement regarding craft, is to \"reclaim the mastery of craft to create an alternative set of tools that could potentially dismantle 'the master's house.\" This is part of their passion in using craft, especially knitting, to push the boundaries in institutions.[10] Moreover, Roberts finds that the issues of marginality they encounter as a queer, gender non-conforming and non-binary person, directly mirror the position(s) of textile and craft within visual culture.[11] All of these materials are also portable, accessible, and can adapt to a variety of circumstances.[12]\nTheir work has been shown in galleries and exhibitions throughout the United States.[5]  A work of Roberts, The Queer Houses of Brooklyn in the Three Towns of Breukelen, Boswyck, and Midwout during the 41st Year of the Stonewall Era, was displayed in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.[2][13] The work, which was subsequently purchased by the Smithsonian,[14] was part of the 2012 40 Under 40: Craft Future exhibition in the Renwick Gallery, featuring artists born since 1972.[15][13]  In 2017, Roberts worked publicly in the galleries of the Museum of Arts and Design as part of the exhibition Studio Views: Craft in the Expanded Field.[16] They knitted, sewed, and appliqu\u00e9d a flat, life-sized van inspired by the 1970s queer van gang, the Van Dykes.[17]\nRoberts is a past co-chair of the Queer Caucus for Art, an affiliate of the College Art Association.[3][18] Roberts has a published essay, \"Reimagining Craft Identities Using Tactics of Queer Theory\", in the 2011 book Extra/Ordinary: Craft and Contemporary Art.[19] In 2015, Roberts was one of nine recipients of the White House Champions of Change award for LGBT Artists.[4][20]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRoberts splits their time between Brooklyn, New York and Joshua Tree, California. Their partner is choreographer and performance artist J Dellecave. Roberts has two Chihuahua mix dogs, Spark and Ziggy.[4]\n\nWorks[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTitle of Work\n\nYear Published\n\nMedium\n\n\nMagic Johnson #1\n\n2007\n\nAcrylic yarn\n\n\nMagic Johnson #2\n\n2007\n\nAcrylic yarn\n\n\nPortrait of Deb 1989-999?\n\n2013\n\nSingle-strand embroidery on cotton\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"C.V.\" L.J.

Whether they want someone a little bit skinnier, a little bit taller, a little bit prettier, but MTV wants you to be yourself ... not censoring anything and not conforming to anything.\"[7]\nIn 2009, Rose won the ASTRA Award for Favourite Female Personality.[12] She also travelled to Kenya to \"highlight ... [the] amazing work\" done by Global Vision International.[5] She appeared in the episode \"Media Virgins\", of Australia's Next Top Model, acting as a guest judge,[13] and also worked as a correspondent for the finale of Australia's Next Top Model.[14]\nIn July 2009, Rose along with Dave Hughes, Charlie Pickering, Carrie Bickmore and James Mathison hosted The 7pm Project, an Australian television news talk show produced by Roving Enterprises which airs weeknights on Network Ten.[15] She left the program to pursue her own hosting projects.

In an interview with Variety, she described how she was not able to get a manager, agent, or audition; so she decided to create short films \"as a way of being able to give myself something to do and to study my craft.\" The film went viral, getting millions of views in a short period of time.[21]\nIn 2015, Rose joined the Orange Is the New Black cast in season 3. Rose played inmate Stella Carlin, \"whose sarcastic sense of humor and captivating looks quickly draw the attention of some of Litchfield's inmates.\"[22][23] Rose's performance was generally well received by the public.[24] She was also cast in a guest role, as the service robot Wendy, in the science fiction series Dark Matter.[25]\nIn 2016, Rose and Tom Felton lent their voices to the animated title Sheep & Wolves, with Rose as fianc\u00e9 Bianca.\nIn 2016 and 2017, Rose appeared in three action film sequels, XXX: Return of Xander Cage, alongside Vin Diesel, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter as Abigail, and John Wick: Chapter 2, alongside Keanu Reeves; she also played a musical rival in the comedy Pitch Perfect 3, which was released in December 2017.[26]\nRose co-starred in the Warner Bros. film The Meg, a shark epic based on the novel of the same name, alongside Jason Statham; the film was released on 10 August 2018.[27]\nOn 7 August 2018, it was reported that Rose had been cast as Batwoman in an Arrowverse crossover.[28] Her role as Kate Kane has been noted as the first openly lesbian lead superhero in television.[29] Batwoman aired on The CW on 6 October 2019.[30] Rose's casting as Batwoman was met by backlash on social media and generated intense criticism.[31][32] DC Comics, which owns the rights to the longtime comic book superheroine Batwoman, reintroduced the character in 2006 as a lesbian of Jewish descent. Some online commentators criticized Rose for not being Jewish, while the main focus of the scrutiny was the assertion that the fact she identifies as genderfluid made her \"not gay enough\" for the role.[31] Rose quit Twitter and deactivated public commenting on her Instagram account following the backlash.[31] Prior to leaving Twitter, she released a tweet responding to the negative reaction, stating, \"Where on earth did 'Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can\u2019t be batwoman' come from\u00a0\u2014 has to be the funniest most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever read.\"[33] Rose called for unity between women and minorities, imploring women and the LGBT community to be kinder and more supportive of each other.[31][33] Rose suffered an injury during the production of the first season.[34] On 19 May 2020, Rose departed Batwoman after the first season, and did not initially give a definitive reason behind her departure.[35] Her character was subsequently written out of the series and replaced with a new one named Ryan Wilder, portrayed by Javicia Leslie.[36]\nOn 22 May 2020, Rose portrayed  Viola in a livestreamed table-read of Twelfth Night as part of a benefit to raise money for COVID-19 pandemic relief.[37][a]\nRose will also star in the action comedy Three Sisters.[38]\n\nMusic and charity work[edit]\nIn January 2012, Rose released her first single \"Guilty Pleasure\" with Gary Go. In November 2016, Rose released and directed The Veronicas' single \"On Your Side\".[39] She is a supporter of many charities, won a charity boxing match,[40] and has travelled to Laos and Africa to volunteer each year. Issues of concern to her include animal welfare, campaigns for anti-bullying and youth mental health, where she works as an ambassador for Headspace. Known for being extensively tattooed, she showed off her tattoos in a photo spread for Maxim Australia and PETA, as part of the campaign \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\".[41][42]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nRose came out as a lesbian at age 12.[43] She said that she was bullied, and that it included both verbal and physical abuse by her male peers, because of her sexuality and gender variance.[44][45] She was also sexually abused as a child by a relative.[46] Rose experienced suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide at age 12.[43][44] Commenting on having attempted suicide multiple times throughout her life and being diagnosed with different disorders, including clinical depression (which was initially misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder,[47] she stated that she has struggled with mental health issues all of her life. She added, \"What I have learned from the struggles of mental health is just how strong I am.\"[47]\nRose said she was convinced she was a boy while growing up and that she was saving up money to physically transition from female to male.[45][48] She said, \"It was in my mind as something I wanted to do and then I just... didn't. I guess I grew out of it. I even used to sleep on my front because I didn't want to get boobs ever, which I think worked actually.\"[48] She stated that modelling led her to discover androgyny, and allowed her to model with different gender expressions. She recalled, \"I remember being at a yum cha restaurant with my dad and the owner coming up and saying, 'Excuse me, we're trying to work out if you're a handsome boy or a beautiful girl.' It was a compliment and I was shocked, and when I thought about it I actually wanted to be a handsome boy.\"[49]\nRose is genderfluid, saying, \"I am very gender fluid and feel more like I wake up every day sort of gender neutral.\"[50] This announcement came approximately a week after she released Break Free, in which she visually transforms from a very feminine woman to a heavily tattooed man. Rose stated, however, that she prefers to continue using feminine pronouns.[51] While if she had to choose a sex, she commented that she would choose to be male, she does not feel like she should have been born with different body parts. Seeing the desire her transgender friends had for transitioning, she asked herself if her need to transition matched theirs, and concluded that she is satisfied being gender neutral. \"I think at this stage I will stay a woman but ... who knows. I'm so comfortable right now I feel wonderful about it, but I also fluctuate a lot,\" she added.[45]\nIn 2014, Rose announced her engagement to fashion designer Phoebe Dahl; in December 2015, they ended their romantic relationship.[52][53] Rose was in a relationship with singer Jess Origliasso of The Veronicas from October 2016 to April 2018,[54] having previously dated in 2008.[55]\nRose is a vegan; she suggested that people who want to help address climate change should consider what they are eating.[56]\nIn 2019, Rose underwent emergency back surgery for a spine issue that led to two herniated discs caused by her work on a film set doing physical stunts. She said if she did not have the surgery, she was at risk of being paralyzed.[57]\n\nIn the media[edit]\n Rose at Australian Fashion Week in 2012\nVarious media outlets have commented on public fascination with Rose's gender identity, gender expression, and physical appearance, including her tattoos and visual or behavioral similarities to Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber, and a younger Leonardo DiCaprio.[58][59][60] In 2008 and 2009, she was chosen as one of the \"25 Most Influential Gay and Lesbian Australians\" by SameSame, an Australian online gay and lesbian community.[61] The public and media attention increased following Rose's debut on Orange Is the New Black, significantly with regard to heterosexual women commenting on her physical appearance.[58][62] During 2015, she was the fifth most searched person on Google.[63] PETA named her one of three \"Sexiest Vegans\" of 2017.[64]\nEmma Teitel of Maclean's stated, \"Rose [...] resembles an androgynous Angelina Jolie; she is a rare combination of angular and soft. She is a badass with a permanently arched brow and a Justin Bieber haircut. In other words, she is the lesbian James Dean. And straight women are falling madly in love with her.\"[62] Alex Rees of Cosmopolitan said that everyone was enamored of Rose at the time of her season three appearance on Orange Is the New Black.[65]\nThe media attention resulted in a new, open discourse about sexual fluidity and whether or not sexual orientation can change, with some of the media expressing disapproval toward heterosexual women stating that they would \"go gay for Ruby Rose.\"[62][65] Teitel wrote that many on Twitter expressed skepticism that all it takes is a pretty face to change sexual orientation, and this was accompanied by the argument that saying \"you [can] 'go gay' for Ruby Rose reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice, and is homophobic.\" She felt that it was predictable and ironic that the people most eager to admonish others for expressing their attraction to Rose were a part of the LGBT community, and cited a Jezebel article which commented that homosexuality and bisexuality are not simply identities to show off liberalism, but are rather \"built into a person's biology.\" To Teitel, this response suggested that \"one must either reject the norm (heterosexuality) or embrace it full force.\" Disagreeing with this approach, she commented that \"sexual exploration is a lot less daunting when labels are malleable\", and emphasized the idea of \"letting everyone define their sexuality on their own terms.\"[62]\nRose acknowledged the public discourse concerning her physical appearance and subsequent debate on sexual fluidity, commenting that, while she thought it was brilliant and was not expecting it, some of her friends found the public affection toward her inappropriate: \"They personally are offended by it, [and are] saying like, 'You can't just choose to be gay. You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.[65]\nIn Entertainment Weekly's 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series Batwoman.[66] She stated that the opportunity to audition for Orange Is the New Black came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in Batwoman, I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman\u00a0\u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"[66]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2013\n\nAround the Block\n\nHannah\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\nBreak Free\n\nHerself\n\nShort film\n\n\n2016\n\nSheep and Wolves\n\nBianca (voice)\n\nEnglish dub\n\n\nResident Evil: The Final Chapter\n\nAbigail\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nXXX: Return of Xander Cage\n\nAdele Wolff\n\nNominated\u00a0\u2014 Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: ActionNominated\u00a0\u2014 Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Ship (shared with Deepika Padukone)\n\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2\n\nAres\n\n\n\n\nPitch Perfect 3\n\nCalamity\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\nThe Meg\n\nJaxx Herd\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nCranston Academy: Monster Zone\n\nLiz (voice)\n\n\n\n\nThe Doorman\n\nAli\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\nSAS: Red Notice\n\nGrace\n\nPost-production\n\n\nVanquish[67]\n\nVictoria\n\nFilming\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2007\u20132011\n\nMTV Australia\n\nHerself\n\nMTV VJ\n\n\n2009\u20132010\n\n20 to 1\n\n2 episodes\n\n\n2009\n\nTalkin' 'Bout Your Generation\n\nHerself / Guest\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Next Top Model\n\nHerself / Guest Judge / Co-host\n\n\n\n\nMTV Australia Awards 2009\n\nHerself / Host\n\n\n\n\n2009\u20132011\n\nThe Project\n\nHerself / Co-host\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nUltimate School Musical\n\nHerself / Host\n\n\n\n\n52nd Logies Awards\n\n\n\n\nVancouver Winter Olympics\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\nMr & Mrs Murder\n\nHerself\n\nEpisode: \"Early Checkout\"\n\n\n2015\u20132016\n\nOrange Is the New Black\n\nStella Carlin\n\nScreen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Comedy SeriesNominated \u2013 Glamour Award for International TV Actress\n\n\n2015\n\nDark Matter\n\nWendy\n\nEpisode: \"Episode Seven\"\n\n\n2015 MTV Europe Music Awards\n\nHerself / Co-host\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nLip Sync Battle\n\nHerself\n\nEpisode: \"Milla Jovovich vs. Ruby Rose\"\n\n\n2018\u20132019\n\nThe Flash\n\nKate Kane / Batwoman\n\nEpisode: \"Elseworlds, Part 1\" (uncredited), \"Crisis on Infinite Earths, Part 3\"\n\n\nArrow\n\nEpisodes: \"Elseworlds, Part 2\", \"Crisis on Infinite Earths, Part 4\"\n\n\nSupergirl\n\nEpisodes: \"Elseworlds, Part 3\", \"Crisis on Infinite Earths, Part 1\"[68]\n\n\n2019\u20132020\n\nBatwoman\n\nLead role (season 1; 20 episodes)\n\n\n2020\n\nLegends of Tomorrow\n\nEpisode: \"Crisis on Infinite Earths, Part 5\"\n\nMusic videos[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nArtist\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2003\n\n\"Rich\"\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\"Boys like You\"\n\n360\n\nLove interest\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\"Guilty Pleasure\"\n\nHerself and Gary Go\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\n\"On Your Side\"\n\nThe Veronicas\n\nLove interest\n\nAlso writer and director\n\n\n\"My Baby\"\n\nRuss\n\nHerself\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\"How A Heart Unbreaks\"\n\nEvermoist\n\nCalamity\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\"Yo Visto As\u00ed\"\n\nBad Bunny\n\nHerself\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAssociation\n\nCategory\n\nNominated work\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\nNotes\n\n\n2009\n\nASTRA Awards\n\nFavourite Female Personality\n\nHerself\n\nWon\n\n[69]\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\nBritish LGBT Awards\n\nCelebrity Rising Star\n\nNominated\n\n[70]\n\n\n\n\nGQ Australia\n\nWoman of the Year\n\nWon\n\n[71]\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nBritish LGBT Awards\n\nCelebrity of the Year\n\nNominated\n\n[72]\n\n\n\n\nGLAAD Media Awards\n\nStephen F.

After college Soloway worked as a production assistant in commercials and music videos in Chicago, as well as at Kartemquin Films on the movie Hoop Dreams.[14]\nWhile in Chicago, Joey and Faith co-developed a parody of The Brady Bunch for live stage called The Real Live Brady Bunch, which began their professional theatrical writing and directing endeavors. They also sold a pilot script to HBO called Jewess Jones about a female superhero. Also at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago, the pair created plays The Miss Vagina Pageant, and later, while in Los Angeles, Not Without My Nipples.\nWith Maggie Rowe, Soloway co-created Hollywood Hellhouse and Sit n' Spin.[25]\n\nTelevision[edit]\nSoloway\u2019s TV writing career began on shows such as The Oblongs, Nikki and The Steve Harvey Show. Soloway followed those shows by writing for four seasons on the HBO original series Six Feet Under, ultimately serving as co-executive producer. Six Feet Under ran for five seasons from 2001 to 2005.[26] Soloway received 3 Emmy nominations in 2002, 2003 and 2005 for Outstanding Drama Series.[27] Soloway's short story, Courteney Cox's Asshole, caught the attention of Alan Ball and led to the job.[12]\nSoloway later wrote episodes of Dirty Sexy Money, Grey's Anatomy, and Tell Me You Love Me and was executive producer/showrunner for the second season of Showtime's United States of Tara, created by Diablo Cody, as well as HBO's How to Make it in America, created by Ian Edelman.\nIn August 2016, Amazon premiered a Soloway-directed pilot of I Love Dick, based on the novel by the same name by Chris Kraus.[28] It was later picked up for a full season,[29] which premiered on May 12, 2017.[30]\n\nTransparent[edit]\nSoloway created the pilot Transparent for Amazon.com, which became available for streaming and download on February 6, 2014, and was part of Amazon's second pilot season.[31][32] Joey and Faith Soloway collaborated, including serving as co-writers on Transparent.[33] They were inspired by their parent who came out as transgender.[16] The show stars Gaby Hoffmann, Jay Duplass, and Amy Landecker as siblings whose parent (played by Jeffrey Tambor) reveals she is going through a significant life transition.[34] The pilot for Transparent was picked up by Amazon Studios.[14][35]\nAs part of the making of the show, Soloway enacted a \"transfirmative action program\", whereby transgender applicants were hired in preference to non-transgender ones.[14] As of August 2014[update], over eighty transgender people have worked on the show, including two transgender consultants.[14]\nSoloway wrote Hoffmann's role on Transparent especially for Hoffmann after seeing her performance on Louie.[36] Transparent premiered all ten episodes simultaneously in late September 2014.[37] The show wrapped its fourth season in 2017, and concluded with a movie finale in 2019.[38]\nSoloway received two Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series in 2014 and 2016 for Transparent and the show has received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series.[27]\n\nFilm[edit]\nSoloway's first film was a 13-minute short titled Una Hora Por Favora, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012. The film stars Michaela Watkins and Wilmer Valderrama. The film tells the story of a woman (Watkins) who hires a day laborer (Valderrama) to do some handy work at her home, but her relationship soon goes beyond professional.[39][40][41]\nSoloway\u2019s debut at Sundance, Afternoon Delight (2013) won the Directing Award.[42] The film follows Rachel (Kathryn Hahn), a thirty-something woman who is struggling to rekindle her relationship with her husband (Josh Radnor), and ultimately befriends an exotic dancer (Juno Temple).[43] In an interview by IndieWire, Soloway had a personal connection to the film's central character, explaining \"There\u2019s a lot of me in Rachel\u2019s journey. I\u2019ve never brought a stripper home, but I\u2019ve always loved reading the memoirs of strippers and sex workers. I feel like they\u2019re the war reporters for women. They go to the front lines of a very particular kind of extreme conflict and live there, then write about it so we can experience it with them.\"[44]\nAfternoon Delight played at national and international film festivals and was nominated for multiple awards, including a Gotham Award for Breakthrough Performance for Kathryn Hahn, and a Spirit Award for First Feature.[45]\nIn June 2019, Soloway signed on to write, direct and produce the Red Sonja remake.[46][47]\n\nWriting[edit]\nSoloway wrote the novella Jodi K., which was published in the collection Three Kinds of Asking For It: Erotic Novellas, edited by Susie Bright. Soloway's memoir, Tiny Ladies in Shiny Pants: Based on a True Story, was released in hardcover in 2005, and then in paperback in 2006.[citation needed] In 2018, Soloway published another book, She Wants It: Desire, Power and Toppling the Patriarchy, with Ebury Press, a division of Penguin Random House.\nJewish religion and culture, sexuality, and gender are recurring themes in Soloway's show, Transparent.[33] According to Soloway, \"The Transparent narrative is not, then, just or even mostly about transition and transgender. It\u2019s about big themes like familial secrets and transformation, revelation and change, all of which are rendered through the specificity and magic of television images and sounds, which create imaginative worlds.\"[33]\nBesides exploring the themes around transitioning and having a transgender parent, Soloway incorporates the female gaze often. In September 2016, Soloway delivered a speech at the Toronto International Film Festival [48] and discussed the concept of the female gaze. Soloway divided the female gaze into three parts: reclaiming the female body, engaging the gaze, and returning the gaze. Soloway includes the female gaze in an attempt to show the viewers what women would feel, see, and experience when they were being watched by the opposite sex. Soloway explained that storytelling about the female gaze was a \u201cconscious effort to create empathy as a political tool\u201d[48] For example, in the television show titled I Love Dick, Soloway said that this show was really about \u201cthe female voice...and creating protagonism for women.\u201d.[49]  According to an article by Madeline Berg, the show portrays the male character as the object and \u201cused for a sexual end.\u201d[50]\nSoloway's writing is often about \"The Heroine's Journey,\" which is about \"repairing the divided feminine: the wife and the other woman confronting each other--mom, stripper. That I think women's journeys are really about repairing these sort of divided parts of ourselves. And this divide in our culture that I think is responsible for so much that is a problem in our culture.\"[51]\n\nHonors[edit]\nSoloway has seven Emmy nominations and two wins.[27] Soloway is also a member of the board of the San Francisco Film Society.[52]\nIn 2015, Soloway's show Transparent won a Golden Globe for Best Series - Musical or Comedy.[53] Later that same year, Soloway won a DGA Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for directing episode 1.08 (\"Best New Girl\") of the show.[54][55] In 2016, Soloway won another Emmy for directing episode 2.09 (\" Man on the Land\") of Transparent.[56] Also in 2016, Soloway was a finalist for The Advocate's Person of the Year,[57] and was named to Oprah Winfrey's SuperSoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders.[58]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 2011, Soloway married music supervisor Bruce Gilbert, with whom Soloway had been in a relationship since 2008. They have a son named Felix Soloway Gilbert. Soloway's older son, Isaac, is from a prior relationship with artist John Strozier. In 2015, Soloway announced being in the process of separating from Gilbert, and that Soloway was in a relationship with poet Eileen Myles, whom Soloway met through Transparent;[1][59] their romantic relationship has since ended,[6] and Myles and Soloway held an event at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, in which they \"processed [their] relationship onstage.\"[6]\nSoloway lives in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles.[5][60]\nIn Soloway\u2019s memoir She Wants It, Soloway discusses accepting a nonbinary identity at age 50 after filming the first two seasons of Transparent.[61]\n\nActivism[edit]\nSoloway is a strong supporter of feminism[62] and co-founded the website Wifey.tv[63] which is described as, \"a curated video network for women\"[64] that includes content created by and for women. In an interview by Forbes, Soloway discusses the site saying, \"I really like when our content appears to contradict itself at first glance. One day we might post something about sexism or the male gaze, then the next day post something that might be seen as precisely too sexy or raunchy, but it comes from a female creator or artist so it\u2019s relevant. We love the conversation and don\u2019t feel as dependent on insisting on a particular point of view.\"[65]\nSoloway also co-founded the East Side Jews collective,[66] which is funded by the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.[67] The collective \"brings together 20- and 30-something Jews in Silver Lake and the surrounding neighborhoods of Los Angeles for offbeat, too-cool-for-shul events that tend to be heavy on comedy and light on Jewish ritual.\"[66]\nSoloway co-wrote The Thanksgiving Paris Manifesto with Eileen Myles in 2016,[68] which is a feminist manifesto about the pornography industry. The manifesto was posted on topplethepatriarchy.com, a domain purchased by Myles and Soloway.[68] The manifesto opens with, \"We shouldn\u2019t be starting with porn but we must. We support the idea of a porn industry and the idea of people making a living photographing and sharing images of sex but we don\u2019t support an industry that exclusively distributes portrayals of almost exclusively male pleasure and climax.\"[69]\n\nWorks or publications[edit]\nBright, Susie, Eric Albert, Greta Christina, and Jill Soloway. \"Jodi K.\" (novella) Susie Bright Presents: Three Kinds of Asking for It: Erotic Novellas, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005; ISBN\u00a0978-0-743-24550-0\nSoloway, Jill.

Their musical style has varied from country to electronic-influenced indie rock and folk punk.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n2 Career\n3 Discography\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSpoon grew up as a transgender person in Calgary, Alberta. They were raised in a Pentecostal household to a paranoid-schizophrenic father. Their father's religious beliefs caused anxiety to a teenage Rae. Spoon now lives in Victoria, British Columbia.\nIn 2003, Spoon said they identified as a trans man.[2] In 2012, during an interview with fellow advocate for the gender-neutral pronoun and cartoonist, Elisha Lim, Spoon noted a preference for the pronoun \"they\",[3] and has identified as non-binary since then.[4] They explained to Now Magazine, \"after years of fighting to be called 'he,' the idea of coming out again made me tired. But now I feel kind of rejuvenated, ready to fight on some more. I think the 'they' pronoun is a pretty cool thing. It's letting a lot of people not have to identify as a man or a woman. Whatever it means to them.\"[5]\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which forced them to cancel a series of tours, Spoon was diagnosed with cervical cancer. They said they didn't know what the prognosis was at that point.[6]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nHow do you become a transgender country singer? For some, it's easier to be transgender from the start,and then work towards becoming a singer. For others it is better to play music first, and then come out as transgender. About ten years ago, I managed to do both in the space of a few months.\nRae Spoon[7]\n\n\nSpoon started performing before they started recording. They decided they wanted to become a songwriter while performing at the age of seventeen.[8] They emerged as a country and roots singer. Their early music features country imagery to the sound of acoustic string instruments such as banjo, guitar and mandolin.[9]\nSpoon has performed with such artists as Annabelle Chvostek, Ember Swift, Kinnie Starr, Melissa Ferrick, The Be Good Tanyas, Bitch & Animal, Natalie Merchant and Earl Scruggs.[10] They have performed at festivals including North Country Fair, South Country Fair, Under the Volcano Festival, and the Vancouver,[10] Regina, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton, Brandon Folk, Music & Art Festival and Winnipeg folk festivals.\nSpoon's breakthrough album, 2008's Superioryouareinferior, was recorded in Calgary and introduced some electronic music elements into Spoon's style.[1] Superioryouareinferior includes themes previously used by Spoon like Canadian history and culture such as the commentary on colonialism in their song \"Come On Forest Fire Burn The Disco Down\".[11] Superioryouareinferior was a longlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize.[12]\nWhile touring Europe Spoon met Alexandre Decoupigny in Berlin. Decoupigny and Spoon collaborated in the album Worauf Wartest Du?[13] Decoupigny taught Spoon how to create music with a computer which inspired the musician to further experiment with electronic music.[14] The experimentation with electronic music influenced their subsequent albums and culminated in I Can't Keep All Our Secrets.[15]\nThey have also published First Spring Grass Fire, a book of short stories about growing up in Alberta. Arsenal Pulp Press released the book in the fall of 2012.[5] The book was a nominee for the 2013 Lambda Literary Awards in the Transgender Fiction category,[16] and Spoon was awarded an Honour of Distinction from the Dayne Ogilvie Prize for LGBT writers in 2014.[17]\nSpoon has stated that First Spring Grass Fire was written to help them  prepare for the production of a National Film Board of Canada documentary about their life and music, My Prairie Home, directed by Chelsea McMullan. The film was released in the fall of 2013.[18][19] My Prairie Home, the album of music that Spoon composed for the film, was a longlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.[20]\nIn 2012, Spoon and Ivan Coyote collaborated on Gender Failure, a touring multimedia show in which both artists performed music and spoken word pieces about their failed attempts at fitting into the gender binary.[21] A book based on the show was published by Arsenal Pulp in 2014.[22] Gender Trouble was nominated for the ALA's Over the Rainbow Project List in 2015.[23]\nIn 2014, Spoon composed music for the feature film The Valley Below.[24]\nSpoon began the music label Coax Records \"out of a love for indie music and as an answer to under representation for many groups in the music industry.\"[25] The album \"Armour\" was released on Coax in 2016.[26]\nIn 2017, Spoon published a manual in the How To series, entitled How to (Hide) Be(hind) You Songs.[27]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nHonking at Minivans (2001)\nThrow Some Dirt on Me (2003)\nYour Trailer Door (2005)\nWhite Hearse Comes Rolling (2006)\nTrucker's Memorial (2006, with Rodney Decroo)\nsuperioryouareinferior (2008)\nWorauf wartest du?

In summer 2012, Stevenson began creating a webcomic around the character, and soon signed with a literary agent who found the webcomic online.[5] Nimona's adventurous story would later double as Stevenson's senior thesis in 2012.[4] In an interview with Paper Magazine, Stevenson stated that the ability to create comics on her own and create Nimona was what got her a \"writing job in animation,\" bringing her into the animation world.[6]\n\nCareer[edit]\nComics and cartoons[edit]\nWhile attending MICA, Stevenson gained fame as a fan artist, under the name \"gingerhaze\", for her \"hipster Lord of the Rings\" characters.[7] She also created cover art for Rainbow Rowell's novel Fangirl. In the summer of 2012, Stevenson interned at BOOM! Studios, a comic publishing house in Los Angeles. After her graduation from MICA in 2013, Stevenson returned to BOOM! to help develop, and eventually write, Lumberjanes.[8] Lumberjanes was recognized as Best New Series and Best Publication for Teens in the 2015 Eisner Awards.[9]\nBesides Lumberjanes, Stevenson also gained fame as the creator of Nimona, a webcomic about a supervillain's shape-shifting sidekick. In 2012, soon after posting the first few installments of Nimona online, Stevenson signed with a literary agent who helped Stevenson sign with HarperCollins to publish Nimona as a graphic novel.[5] For her work on Nimona, Stevenson won Slate Magazine's 2012 Cartoonist Studio Prize for Best Web Comic of the Year[10] and the 2016 Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album: Reprint.[5] Stevenson was also named a 2015 National Book Award Finalist for  the graphic novel version of Nimona.[5]\nSince 2015, she worked as a writer for Marvel Comics on the comics Thor Annual[11][12] and Runaways.[13]\n\nAnimation[edit]\nStevenson was part of the writing team of Disney's animated TV series Wander Over Yonder, beginning with Season 2 in 2015.[14]\nStevenson also served as creator and executive producer of DreamWorks Animation Television's rebooted She-Ra and the Princesses of Power animated television series on Netflix, the first season of which was released on 13 November 2018.[15] Its fifth and final season was released on May 15, 2020.[16]\n\nOther work[edit]\nStevenson did freelance illustration for Random House, St. Martin's Press, and Label Magazine. She also worked with Ryan North on his Kickstarter-funded book To Be or Not to Be, a choose-your-own-adventure-book based on Shakespeare's Hamlet.[8]\nHer autobiographical collection of drawings and journals, The Fire Never Goes Out, was published in March 2020. The New Yorker's review described it as \"a memoir of sorts (...), a coming-out story, a love story, a tale of disorientingly rapid professional triumph, and a story about mental health and illness, showing the young artist figuring out what she must do\u2014first to make art and then to get well.\"[17]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nStevenson married fellow cartoonist Molly Ostertag in September 2019.[18] She identifies as non-binary and uses any personal pronouns.[19] In August 2020, Stevenson said in an interview that she is bipolar.[20]\nOn October 11, 2020, National Coming Out Day, Stevenson wrote and illustrated her coming out story for Oprah Magazine.

She is the creator of the Cartoon Network series Steven Universe, making her the first woman to independently create a series for the network.[1] Until 2013, Sugar was a writer and storyboard artist on the animated television series Adventure Time. Her work on the two series has earned her six Primetime Emmy Award nominations.[2] Sugar is a bisexual non-binary woman, using she/her and they/them pronouns,[3] which has encouraged them to stress the importance of LGBT representation in art, especially in children's entertainment.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Personal life\n3 Career\n\n3.1 Early work\n3.2 Television\n3.3 Themes\n3.4 Other work\n\n\n4 Accolades\n\n4.1 Adventure Time\n4.2 Steven Universe\n4.3 Honors\n\n\n5 Filmography\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSugar was raised in the Sligo Park Hills area of Silver Spring, Maryland. She simultaneously attended Montgomery Blair High School and the Visual Arts Center at Albert Einstein High School[5] (where she was an arts semifinalist in the Presidential Scholar competition,[6] and won Montgomery County's prestigious Ida F. Haimovicz Visual Arts Award),[7] both of which are located in Maryland. While at Blair, she drew several comics (called \"The Strip\" for the school's newspaper, Silver Chips) which won first place for comics in the Newspaper Individual Writing and Editing Contest. \"The Strip\" ran a comic challenging MCPS's new grading policy from 2005.[8] She went on to attend the School of Visual Arts in New York.[9]\nAccording to Sugar's father Rob, Rebecca Sugar and her younger brother Steven were raised with what he called \"Jewish sensibilities\", and both siblings observe the lighting of Hanukkah candles with their parents via Skype.[10]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn February 2016, Ian Jones-Quartey confirmed via Twitter that he and Sugar were in a romantic relationship; at the time of the tweet, the two had been together for eight years.[11] He added that they met when Sugar was at the School of Visual Arts in New York. They were married on December 4, 2019.[12]\nIn July 2016, Sugar said at a San Diego Comic-Con panel that the LGBT themes in Steven Universe are in large part based on her own experience as a bisexual woman.[13] In a July 2018 interview on NPR,[14] Sugar said that she created the series' Gems as non-binary women in order to express herself, as a non-binary woman, through them.[3][15] As of 2019, Sugar goes by both \"she/her\" and \"they/them\" pronouns.[16]\n\nCareer[edit]\nEarly work[edit]\nDuring her time at the School of Visual Arts, Sugar directed short animated films, including Johnny Noodleneck (2008).[17] In 2009, she wrote and animated Singles, in which frequent collaborator Ian Jones-Quartey acted as an assistant animator, assistant inker and voice actor on the project, while Sugar's brother Steven Sugar acted as an assistant colorist.[18] Sugar completed this film as her thesis.[18]\nSugar also played an important role in the creation of nockFORCE, a cartoon series created by Ian Jones-Quartey and Jim Gisriel and launched in 2007 on YouTube. In particular, she contributed to the cartoon's backgrounds and characters.[19]\nIn 2010, Sugar published her first graphic novel, Pug Davis, featuring an astronaut dog and his gay sidekick Blouse.[20][21]\nShe is also known for her comic \"Don't Cry for Me, I'm Already Dead\", a story about two brothers whose shared love of The Simpsons takes a tragic turn.[17]\n\nTelevision[edit]\nSugar first joined the crew of Adventure Time as a storyboard revisionist during the show's first season.[22] Due to the quality of her work, within a month of being hired she was promoted to a storyboard artist, making her debut during the production of the second season.[10] Her first episode was \"It Came from the Nightosphere\".[23] As she put it in an interview with Paper Magazine, she connected with indie and underground comic artists who worked on the show, like Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale and Adam Muto, who told her to do what she would do when drawing comics and to not hold anything back. She stated that some of the changes in animation for years to come were inspired by what the show was able to do by being \"very artist-driven,\" by independent comic artists like herself.[24]\nProduction for Steven Universe began while Sugar was still working on Adventure Time. She continued working on Adventure Time until the show's fifth season, whereupon she left in order to focus on Steven Universe. Her last episode for Adventure Time was \"Simon & Marcy\"; following that episode, working on both series simultaneously \"became impossible to do\". She had also previously encountered difficulty in the production of the Adventure Time episode \"Bad Little Boy\".[25] Sugar returned temporarily to write the song \"Everything Stays\" for the seventh season miniseries Stakes.[26][27]\nShe has been an executive producer for Steven Universe for its entire run, and a storyboard artist for several of its episodes; the series premiered on November 4, 2013 and concluded on January 21, 2019. She directed the full-length television movie taking place after the fifth season of Steven Universe, called Steven Universe: The Movie, which premiered on September 2, 2019 on Cartoon Network.[28] On October 4, 2019, it was announced at New York Comic Con that Steven Universe would not have a sixth season but an epilogue limited series titled Steven Universe Future, premiered on December 7, 2019[29] and concluded on March 27, 2020.\n\nThemes[edit]\nSugar has discussed the importance of creating LGBT representation and content, especially in children's entertainment. On Cameron Esposito's podcast QUEERY, Sugar stated \"I want to champion LGBTQIA, all of it, content...in G-Rated, family entertainment. I want to do that forever\".[4] She also explained how Steven Universe has helped her come to terms with her own identity as bisexual and non-binary. She believes that early and positive exposure to the LGBT community can help queer identifying children avoid experiencing shame in their own identities.[30][31]\n\nOther work[edit]\nSugar designed the album cover of True Romance for Estelle, the voice of Garnet on Steven Universe.[32] In December 2016, comic book publisher Youth in Decline featured Sugar's sketches and story notes for her unpublished comic Margo in Bed as issue #14 of the art/comics anthology series Frontier.[33][34]\nIn 2018, Sugar was featured on Gallant's 2018 R&B/Soul track TOOGOODTOBETRUE, along with Sufjan Stevens.[35]\nIn April 2020, Sugar narrated a video titled Let My People Go, a video created by the organization Never Again Action. The video talks about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees and the poor living conditions they are experiencing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.[36]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nAdventure Time[edit]\nRebecca Sugar's work on Adventure Time gained Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation nominations for the episode \"It Came from the Nightosphere\" in 2011 and for the episode \"Simon & Marcy\" in 2013.[37] The show also earned multiple Annie Award nominations. These included, Best Storyboarding in a Television Production in 2012[38] and Story-boarding in an Animated Television Production in 2013.[39]\n\nSteven Universe[edit]\nMain article: Steven Universe \u00a7\u00a0Awards and nominations\nFor Steven Universe, Sugar has been nominated for several media industry awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards. She and the series have received, among others, the 2018 Peabody Award for Children's & Youth Programming and the 2019 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Kids & Family Program; in 2015 the series was named to the James Tiptree Jr. Award Honor List.\n\nHonors[edit]\nIn 2012, Forbes magazine included her on its \"30 Under 30 in Entertainment\" list, noting that she was responsible for writing \"many of the best episodes\" of Adventure Time.[1]\nVariety included Sugar in \"Hollywood's New Leaders 2016: The Creatives\", a list celebrating upcoming filmmakers, show-runners and creators in both traditional and digital media.[40]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2009\n\nSingles\n\nDirector, story writer, animator and composer[18]\n\nShort film\n\n\n2010\u201320132015, 2018\n\nAdventure Time\n\nStory writer, storyboard artist, songwriter, storyboard revisionistVoice role: Marceline's mother\n\nTelevision series\n\n\n2012\n\nHotel Transylvania\n\nStoryboard artist[41]\n\nFilm\n\n\n2013\u20132019\n\nSteven Universe\n\nCreator, executive producer, storyline writer, storyboard artist, songwriter\n\nTelevision series\n\n\n2017\u20132019\n\nOK K.O.!

The artwork consisted of Sulkowicz carrying a mattress wherever she went on campus during her final year at Columbia University.[5] Sulkowicz said the piece would end when the student whom she alleged had raped her in her dorm room in 2012 was expelled or otherwise left the university.[6][7] The work was a protest against campus sexual assault and the university's handling of the sexual assault case, in which it had cleared the accused of responsibility.[8]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Rape allegation\n3 Works\n\n3.1 Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)\n3.2 Newspaper Bodies (Look, Mom, I'm on the Front Page!)\n3.3 Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol\n3.4 Self-Portrait\n3.5 The Ship Is Sinking\n3.6 Untitled Protest Performance\n3.7 The Floating World\n\n\n4 See also\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nSulkowicz is the child of Sandra Leong and Kerry Sulkowicz, both psychiatrists from Manhattan, and is of Chinese, Japanese and Jewish descent.[9] Sulkowicz attended the Dalton School on the Upper East Side, and was an A student and competitive fencer, and Columbia University, where she obtained a degree in visual arts in 2015.[10] Sulkowicz is non-binary and uses both she/her and they/them pronouns.[11]\n\nRape allegation[edit]\nMain article: Columbia University rape controversy\nIn April 2013, Sulkowicz, then in the fourth year of a degree, filed a complaint with Columbia requesting the expulsion of fellow fourth-year student and German national, Paul Nungesser, alleging he had raped her in Sulkowicz's dorm room on August 27, 2012.[12] Nungesser was found 'not responsible' by a university inquiry. In May 2014, Sulkowicz filed a report against Nungesser with the New York Police Department (NYPD), which did not pursue charges.[13][14] The district attorney's office interviewed Sulkowicz and Nungesser, but did not pursue charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion.[14] Sulkowicz declined to pursue criminal charges further, saying it would be too draining and that NYPD officers were dismissive and had mistreated her.[15][16][17][18] Sulkowicz subsequently focused her senior thesis on a work of performance art entitled Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight). The performance and the allegations received considerable media attention, with Sulkowicz becoming known as \"Mattress Girl\". Nungesser denied Sulkowicz's allegations of rape, citing as evidence friendly messages from Sulkowicz in the weeks following the alleged attack.[19]\nIn April 2015, Nungesser filed a Title IX gender discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor Jon Kessler, alleging that they had facilitated gender-based harassment by allowing the art project to proceed.[14] Federal District Court Judge Gregory H. Woods dismissed the lawsuit[20] but allowed Nungesser to refile an amended suit,[21] the refiled complaint was also dismissed, but Columbia settled the case under undisclosed terms after Nungesser's attorney began the process of appealing the dismissal.[22]\n\nWorks[edit]\nMattress Performance (Carry That Weight)[edit]\nMain article: Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)\n Sulkowicz (center right) carrying the mattress at graduation\nSulkowicz created Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight) in the summer of 2014 as a senior thesis while at Yale University Summer School of Art and Music. This performance artwork was in protest against campus sexual assault and the university's handling of Sulkowicz's allegation that a fellow student at Columbia University anally raped her.[7] The university cleared the student of responsibility,[8] and the district attorney's office declined to pursue criminal charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion.[23][14]\n\nSulkowicz's first effort was a video of herself dismantling a bed, accompanied by the audio of her filing the police report, which she had recorded on a cellphone.[3] The mattress later became the sole focus of the piece.[7] Sulkowicz told New York magazine:I thought about how\u00a0... the mattress represents a private place where a lot of your intimate life happens; and how I have brought my life out in front for the public to see; and the act of bringing something private and intimate out into the public mirrors the way my life has been. Also the mattress as a burden, because of what has happened there, that has turned my own relationship with my bed into something fraught.[18]\nThe 50-pound (23\u00a0kg), dark-blue, extra-long twin mattress used in the performance art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which she says she was raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: written on the walls of her studio in the university's Watson Hall, these stated that Sulkowicz must carry the mattress whenever she was on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz was not there; and that Sulkowicz was not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but could accept if help was offered.[3][24] In September that year she began carrying it on campus, which she said was a physically painful experience.[25]\nDuring a protest organized by the student group No Red Tape on Oct. 29, 2014, hundreds of Columbia students stacked 28 mattresses on Columbia's president Lee Bollinger's doorstep. The mattresses symbolized the 28 sexual assault complaints in Columbia's Title IX case, reported New York Magazine. The Columbia student group Student Worker Solidarity, who booked the space for No Red Tape, would be charged $1500 for the removal of the mattresses on behalf of the University.[26]\n\nNewspaper Bodies (Look, Mom, I'm on the Front Page!)[edit]\nSulkowicz's final thesis show, the week before graduation in May 2015, included depictions of a naked man with an obscenity and a couple having sex, printed onto a New York Times article about the student she accused. Sulkowicz said that the images were cartoons, and asked: \"what are the functions of cartoons? Do they depict the people themselves (a feat which, if you've done enough reading on art theory, you will realize is impossible), or do they illustrate the stories that have circulated about a person?\"[27] This work was later shown under the title Newspaper Bodies (Look, Mom, I'm on the Front Page!) as part of a group exhibition at the Southampton Arts Center, Southampton, New York.[28]\n\nCeci N'est Pas Un Viol[edit]\nMain article: Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol\nOn June 3, 2015, Sulkowicz, working with artist Ted Lawson, released Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol (\"This is not a rape\"), an eight-minute video of Sulkowicz having sex with an anonymous actor in a Columbia dorm room.[4] The title of the piece is a reference to the caption in Ren\u00e9 Magritte's The Treachery of Images: \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\". Introductory text by Sulkowicz stresses that the sex was consensual throughout, though toward the end it portrays resistance, violence and force.[29] When the video was first posted, each screen displayed the timestamp of August 27, 2012, the night of the alleged assault, but later the date was blurred.[30] Sulkowicz wrote that the work, which examines the nature of sexual consent, was not a reenactment of the alleged rape and later stated that it was a separate piece from Mattress Performance.[29]\n\nSelf-Portrait[edit]\nFrom February to March 2016 at Coagula Curatorial in Los Angeles, Sulkowicz exhibited a piece, Self-Portrait.[31] For the first three weeks of the exhibition, Sulkowicz stood on a pedestal in the gallery, and had one-on-one conversations with visitors who would stand on an identical pedestal in front of her.[32] The exhibition featured a life-sized robotic replica of the artist that was called \"Emmatron\". Emmatron plays prerecorded answers to several questions Sulkowicz has been repeatedly asked, which she will no longer respond to. A few examples of questions Emmatron had answers to included \"Tell me about the night you were assaulted\", \"Is this art piece a part of Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)?\" and \"What do your parents think of all this?\"[33] If audience members asked these questions to Sulkowicz during their conversation, the artist would send them to Emmatron for the answers.[34]\n\nThe Ship Is Sinking[edit]\nIn 2017, Sulkowicz performed a bondage performance piece titled \u201cThe Ship Is Sinking\u201d.[35] In the piece, Sulkowicz (in high heels and bikini with the \u201cWhitney\u201d logo, to convey the look of a woman in a beauty pageant) is tied up, berated and hung from the ceiling on a wooden beam by a man in a suit, \u201cMaster Avery\u201d,[35][36] as the figurehead of a ship.[37] Sulkowicz said \u201cwhite cis men have the privilege of making art that can be divorced from their lives\u201d[38] while \u201cit\u2019s a privilege that I don\u2019t really have so I\u2019m trying to work in a way that makes the best use of that position as I can.\u201d At closing time, the museum turned off its lights, but spectators stayed and used phone flashlights to continue watching until Sulkowicz was finished.[38] Sulkowicz portrayed being able to express the pain she felt and endured, putting herself physically within the artwork.\n\nUntitled Protest Performance[edit]\nOn January 30, 2018, Sulkowicz was documented protesting at two New York City museums and a subway station. During the protest, Sulkowicz posed for several photographs in front of Chuck Close paintings at The Museum of Modern Art and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, a Close mosaic in a subway station, as well as in front of Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Sulkowicz wore black lingerie, with home-made pasties made of tape, and covered her body with drawn-on asterisks. Sulkowicz stated that the protest was a response to a New York Times article from January 28, in which members of the art world, responding to allegations of sexual harassment towards artist Chuck Close, debated over the future of art created by individuals accused of improper behavior. Among the people quoted in the article was Jock Reynolds, the then-director of the Yale University Art Gallery, who stated, \"Pablo Picasso was one of the worst offenders of the 20th century in terms of his history with women. Are we going to take his work out of the galleries? At some point you have to ask yourself, is the art going to stand alone as something that needs to be seen?\"[39] Sulkowicz was reportedly \"appalled\" by the comments, asking, \"are you only showing work by Harvey Weinstein?\"[40] The protest was described as a \"performance\" in the media,[41][40] and as \"performative action\" by the artist.[42]\n\nThe Floating World[edit]\nFrom March 10 to April 22, 2018, The Invisible Dog gallery in Brooklyn, New York hosted Sulkowicz's first gallery installation, a piece entitled The Floating World.[40] The piece consists of a series of glass orbs, suspended by ropes, containing objects of personal significance to Sulkowicz and members of her community.[43]\n\nSee also[edit]\nColumbia University rape controversy\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kunter, Jenny (May 20, 2015). \"Columbia University president refuses graduation handshake with anti-rape activist Emma Sulkowicz\".

The album included elements of pop music, electronic music, ska, and punk. The first single, \"Caesar\", featured Swedish pop singer Robyn.[4] The next single, \"Self Machine\", was released in July 2010.[5]\nAccording to Christian W\u00e5hlberg, Sumner's manager, \u00c5hlund, had been keen to work with Sumner because he saw the \"punk rocker\" in Sumner.[6] W\u00e5hlberg said that the electropop sound of the album was influenced by Darcus Beese, president of Island Records, and that if Sumner had signed to a different record label, the music would have been different.[6]\n\nSolo career[edit]\nIn 2014, Sumner said their music would be released under their birth name, Eliot Sumner. Later that year, they released the EP Information, and in 2016 the full album Information appeared.\nSumner's contributions to other musicians' albums include vocals for the song \"End of the Road\" by Sway and the single \"Splash\" by Sub Focus.[7] Sumner sang a cover version of the Radiohead song \"Creep\" with Clint Mansell for the soundtrack to the movie Filth (2013).\n\nActing career[edit]\nSumner appeared briefly in the films Me Without You (2001) and Stardust (2007). They made their adult acting debut in Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen in 2020. They are set to appear in the upcoming James Bond film No Time to Die (2020).[8]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nEliot Paulina Sumner is the child of musician Sting (Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner) and actress Trudie Styler.[9] Sumner was born in Pisa, Italy, grew up in Wiltshire, England,[4] and was educated at Bryanston School and then the Fine Arts College in London.[10]\nSumner grew up at Lake House, the family estate near Stonehenge. They have two brothers (Jake and Giacomo), a sister (Mickey), an older half-brother (Joe), and a half-sister (Kate). Family gave Sumner the nickname \"Coco\". Drawn to the outdoors, Sumner spent a lot of time alone in the woods. They were given their first guitar at age four or five, wrote their first song at age 13, and signed a record deal four years later. After recording and touring with I Blame Coco, they lived alone in a cottage in the Lake District of England and became interested in house music. Sumner also works as a DJ in European dance clubs under the moniker \"Vaal\".[11]\nSumner's sense of smell was lost after a brain injury in 2009.[9]\nIn December 2015, when asked if they identified with a particular gender, Sumner replied that they did not believe in gender labels.[11][12] Sumner said in February 2020 that they prefer gender-neutral pronouns.[8]\n\nAwards and honours[edit]\nI Blame Coco was nominated for Best Newcomer at the Virgin Media Music Awards in 2010.\nDiscography[edit]\nStudio albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nAlbum details\n\nPeak chart positions\n\n\nUK\n\nAUT[13]\n\nBEL(VL)[14]\n\nBEL(WA)[15]\n\nFRA[16]\n\nGER\n\nPOL[17]\n\nSWI[18]\n\n\nThe Constant(as I Blame Coco)\n\n\nReleased: 8 November 2010\nLabel: Island\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\n86\n\n58\n\n82\n\n88\n\n41\n\n31\n\n36\n\n72\n\n\nInformation\n\n\nReleased: 22 January 2016\nLabel: Island\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n99\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\nNosferatu(as Vaal)\n\n\nReleased: 25 January 2019\nLabel: Pale Blue Dot\nFormats: Vinyl\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nSingles[edit]\nAs lead artist[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nPeak chart positions\n\nAlbum\n\n\nUK\n\nBEL(VL)[14]\n\nBEL(WA)[15]\n\nGER\n\n\n\"Caesar\" (featuring Robyn)\n\n2010\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Constant\n\n\n\"Selfmachine\"\n\n64\n\n53\n\n93\n\n56\n\n\n\"Quicker\"\n\n\u2014\n\n91\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\"In Spirit Golden\"\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\"Turn Your Back on Love\"\n\n2011\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\"Information\"\n\n2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nInformation\n\n\n\"I Followed You Home\"\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\"Dead Arms & Dead Legs\"\n\n2015\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\"After Dark\"\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\"Firewood\"\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\"Species\"\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nAs featured artist[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nPeak chart positions\n\nAlbum\n\n\nUK\n\nUKDance\n\n\n\"Animal\" (with Miike Snow)\n\n2009\n\n98\n\n\u2014\n\nMiike Snow\n\n\n\"Splash\" (with Sub Focus)\n\n2010\n\n41\n\n7\n\nSub Focus\n\nOther: Remixes[edit]\nEliot Sumner \u2013 After Dark (Mr Tophat's Alterned 303 Remix)\nEliot Sumner \u2013 After Dark (Dixon Remix)\nEliot Sumner \u2013 Firewood \u2013 Lakker Remix\nMusic videos[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nDirector\n\n\n2010\n\n\"Caesar\"\n\nHope Audikana[19]\n\n\n\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\"\n\nTom & Tabitha[20]\n\n\n\"Splash\"\n\nNick Frew[21]\n\n\n\"Self Machine\"\n\nAlex Smith[22]\n\n\n\"Quicker\"\n\nChina Moo-Young[23]\n\n\n\"In Spirit Golden\"\n\nHope Audikana[24]\n\n\n2014\n\n\"Information\"\n\nEliot Lee Hazel[25]\n\n\n2015\n\n\"Dead Arms & Dead Legs\"\n\ntech wizards, Flat-E[26]\n\n\n\"After Dark\"\n\n\n\"Firewood\"\n\n\n\"Species\"\n\n\n\"I Followed You Home\"\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"About\".

In 1998, she was the host of the first Gay Shame event in New York, appearing with performer Penny Arcade, writer Eileen Myles, cabaret artists Kiki and Herb, and queercore band Three Dollar Bill held in Brooklyn, NY, which was captured in the documentary film entitled Gay Shame 98, by Scott Berry. She was one of the instigators of Gay Shame in San Francisco, which started in 2000 and became \"a year-round direct action extravaganza dedicated to exposing all hypocrites\".[3] Sycamore was involved in the cultural center Dumba, and is a leading critic of assimilationist trends in gay culture.[4][5][6]\nSycamore's first anthology, Tricks and Treats: Sex Workers Write About Their Clients, was published by Haworth Press in 2000. Her first novel, Pulling Taffy, was published by Suspect Thoughts Press in 2003. Her second anthology, Dangerous Families: Queer Writing on Surviving, was published by Haworth Press in 2004. Her third anthology, That's Revolting!: Queer Strategies for Resisting Assimilation, was published by Soft Skull Press that same year. Her fourth anthology, Nobody Passes: Rejecting the Rules of Gender and Conformity, was published by Seal Press in 2006. \nHer second novel, So Many Ways to Sleep Badly, was published by City Lights Books in 2008. Her fifth anthology, Why Are Faggots So Afraid of Faggots? Flaming Challenges to Masculinity, Objectification, and the Desire to Conform, was published by AK Press in 2012, and was an American Library Association Stonewall Honor Book.[7]\nSycamore's first memoir, The End of San Francisco, was published by City Lights Books in 2013, and won a Lambda Literary Award.[8] Her third novel, Sketchtasy, was published by Arsenal Pulp Press in 2018. Her second memoir, The Freezer Door, was published by Semiotext(e) in 2020, and received rave reviews in The New York Times[9] and The Washington Post[10] on the publication date.\nIn January 2009, Sycamore initiated a public postering project called Lostmissing, which she describes as:\n\nYou know when you have a friend who you think will always be there\u2014no matter what, at least you'll have that friendship, right? Lostmissing is a public art project about the loss of that relationship, a specific relationship for me\u2014right now it's missing.[11]\nSycamore opposed the push among the LGBT movement for same-sex marriage, arguing that it distracts from more pressing issues like the securing of universal health care and housing security for all.[12][13] Sycamore also opposed the LGBT movement's focus on inclusion in the US military, arguing instead that the movement should be focused on opposing the harmful impacts of the military at home and abroad. In 2010, she appeared on Democracy Now! in the segment Does Opposing \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d Bolster US Militarism? A Debate with Lt. Dan Choi and Queer Activist Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, and later penned op-eds against trans inclusion in the military in Truthout[14] and The Baffler.[15] In 2018, in collaboration with Dean Spade, Sycamore co-organized a Queer Anti-Militarism Townhall: Trans Liberation Not U.S. Invasion at the Seattle Public Library, alongside other queer and trans anti-military voices, including Micha C\u00e1rdenas, Soya Jung, Nikkita Oliver and Matt Remle. Sycamore contributed to Against Equality: Queer Critiques of Gay Marriage,[16] and wrote the introduction to Against Equality: Queer Revolution, Not Mere Inclusion,[17] anthologies printed by the Against Equality collective in 2010 and 2014. In 2008, Sycamore was named as a \"visionary\" as part of Utne Reader magazine's \"50 Visionaries Who Are Changing the World.\"[18]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\nSycamore was awarded the Lambda Literary Award for Transgender Non-Fiction on June 2, 2014, for her 2013 book The End of San Francisco.[8] NPR's Book Concierge included Sketchtasy on its list of the Best Books of 2018.[19]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nSycamore is genderqueer and uses she/her pronouns.[13] She has described herself as, \"A genderqueer, faggot, and a queen, on the trans continuum, in a gender bending, gender blur kind of place. But the words I relate to the most are probably 'faggot' and 'queen.' 'Queer' would be more of a broader political identity.\"[20]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nNovels[edit]\nSketchtasy Vancouver, BC: Arsenal Pulp Press, 2018.

Tempest worked in a record shop from age 14 to 18. They went to Thomas Tallis School, leaving at 16 to study at the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in Croydon, going on to graduate in English Literature from Goldsmiths, University of London.[4][6] Tempest first performed when they were 16, at open mic nights at Deal Real, a small hip-hop store in Carnaby Street in London's West End. They went on to support acts such as John Cooper Clarke, Billy Bragg and Benjamin Zephaniah. They toured internationally with their band Sound of Rum until they disbanded in 2012 before being commissioned to write their first play, Wasted.[9]\nIn August 2020, Tempest came out as non-binary, began using they/them pronouns, and changed their name to Kae.[10]\n\n Kae Tempest performs hip hop, namely their signature piece Let Them Eat Chaos, at the 2017 Treefort Music Fest in Boise, Idaho\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2013, Tempest released their first poetry book Everything Speaks in its Own Way, a limited edition run on their own imprint, Zingaro. At 26, they launched the theatrical spoken word piece Brand New Ancients at the Battersea Arts Centre (2012), to great critical acclaim.[7][8][9][11] The piece also won Tempest the Herald Angel and The Ted Hughes Prize. Some of Tempest's influences include Samuel Beckett, James Joyce, W B Yeats, William Blake, W H Auden and Wu-Tang Clan.[8][9][12]\nIn September 2013, their play Hopelessly Devoted was produced by Paines Plough and premiered at Birmingham Rep Theatre.[13]\nIn 2014, they released the album Everybody Down (Big Dada, Ninja Tune), which was produced by Dan Carey and was nominated for the 2014 Mercury Prize.[14]\nSince the release of Everybody Down, Tempest has increased touring as a musician,[15] playing at festivals and headlining shows with their live band which consists of Kwake Bass on drums,[16] Dan Carey on synths and Clare Uchima on keyboards.[17]\nIn October 2014, their first poetry collection for Picador, Hold Your Own, was published. The collection was a commercial and critical success and its release coincided with Tempest being named a Next Generation Poet.\nTempest was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2015.[18]\nIn April 2016, their debut novel The Bricks That Built The Houses was published by Bloomsbury and was a Sunday Times Bestseller. It won the Books Are My Bag Best Breakthrough Author Award.[11]\nIn September 2016, it was announced that Tempest would curate the 2017 Brighton Festival. They released the album Let Them Eat Chaos on 7 October 2016.[19] It debuted at no. 28 on the UK Albums Chart, and was also released in book format (Picador).[20] The album was also nominated for the Mercury Prize, this time in 2017.[21] They were nominated for Best British Female Solo Performer at the 2018 Brit Awards.[8]\nTempest's song \"People's Faces\" was used for the Facebook commercial \"We're Never Lost If We Can Find Each Other\", created by the agency Droga5, and released on 9 April 2020.[22]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nIn November 2019, along with other public figures, Tempest signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.[23] In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, they signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that \"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\"[24][25]\n\nReception[edit]\nThe Economist said of Tempest's commission from the Royal Shakespeare Company: \"A stunning piece by Kate Tempest, a London-born performance poet, comes bursting off the screen. Rarely has the relevance of Shakespeare to our language, to the very fabric of our feelings, been expressed with quite such youthful passion. (It should be mandatory viewing for all teenagers.)\"[26] The Huffington Post describes them as \"Britain's leading young poet, playwright and rapper...one of the most widely respected performers in the country \u2013 the complete package of lyrics and delivery. [They are] also one of the most exciting young writers working in Britain today\" (2012). The Guardian commented of Brand New Ancients, \"Suddenly it feels as if we are not in a theatre but a church... gathered around a hearth, hearing the age-old stories that help us make sense of our lives. We're given the sense that what we are watching is something sacred.\"[27] In 2013, the newspaper noted:\n\n\n[They are] one of the brightest talents around. [Their] spoken-word performances have the metre and craft of traditional poetry, the kinetic agitation of hip-hop and the intimacy of a whispered heart-to-heart... Tempest deals bravely with poverty, class and consumerism. [They do] so in a way that not only avoids the pitfalls of sounding trite, but manages to be beautiful too, drawing on ancient mythology and sermonic cadence to tell stories of the everyday.[28]\n\n\nIn 2013, they won the Ted Hughes Award for their work Brand New Ancients, the first person under the age of 40 to win the award,[29] and was selected as one of the 2014 Next Generation Poets by the Poetry Society.[30]\nTempest has received wide critical acclaim for their written and live work.[26] A performance of Brand New Ancients prompted the New York Times to say \u201cAs gorgeous streams of words flow out, [they conjure] a story so vivid it\u2019s as if you had a state-of-the-art Blu-ray player stuffed into your brain, projecting image after image that sears itself into your consciousness\u201d[12] while a review by Michiko Kakutani of their poetry collections in the same paper explored their written style: \u201cWhile [their] intense performances on stage add a fierce urgency to the words, these text versions of [their] work stand powerfully on their own on the page...using [their] pictorial imagination to sear specific images into the reader\u2019s mind\u201d.[14]\nThey have been published in nine languages.\nEverybody Down was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize and Let Them Eat Chaos have been nominated for the 2017 Mercury Music Prize. Their accompanying poetry book Let Them Eat Chaos was nominated for the Costa Book of the Year in the Poetry Category in 2016. They were nominated as Best Female Solo Performer at the 2018 Brit Awards.\n\nWorks[edit]\nPoetry Collections[edit]\n2012: Everything Speaks in its Own Way\n2013: Brand New Ancients\n2014: Hold Your Own\n2016: Let Them Eat Chaos\n2018: Running Upon The Wires\nSpoken word performance[edit]\n2012: Brand New Ancients \u2013 Ted Hughes Award 2013 (2014 released as CD)\n Kae Tempest at Primavera Sound 2019\nPlays[edit]\n2013: Wasted\n2014: Glasshouse\n2014: Hopelessly Devoted\nNovel[edit]\n2016: The Bricks That Built the Houses, Bloomsbury Circus, London\nNon-fiction Book[edit]\n2020: On Connection, Faber & Faber, London\nDiscography[edit]\nStudio albums\n\n2011: Balance (with \"Sound of Rum\")\n2014: Everybody Down \u2013 nominated for Mercury Prize 2014\n2016: Let Them Eat Chaos - nominated for Mercury Prize 2017[31]\n2019: The Book of Traps and Lessons\nSingles\n\n2014: \"Our Town\"\n2014: \"Hot Night Cold Spaceship\"\n2015: \"Bad Place for a Good Time\"\n2016: \"Guts (with Loyle Carner)\"\nAs featured artist\n\n2008: \"I Got Love (remix)\" (The King Blues featuring Kae Tempest)\n2010: \"Drum Song (brentonLABS Remix)\" (The Temper Trap featuring Kae Tempest)\n2012: \"Forever Ever\" (Bastille featuring Kae Tempest & Jay Brown)\n2014: \"Our Town\" (letthemusicplay featuring Kae Tempest)\n2014: \"Rain\" (Rag'n'Bone Man featuring Kae Tempest)\n2014: \"Summer\" (letthemusicplay featuring Kae Tempest)\n2018: \"Kairos\" (Warsnare featuring Kae Tempest)\n2018: \"A Child Is an Open Book\" (Damien Dempsey featuring Kae Tempest)\n2018: \"Usubscribe\" (Jam Baxter featuring Kae Tempest)\n2018: \"6 Millions Stories\" (Foreign Beggars featuring Kae Tempest, Bangzy, Scott Garcia & Bionic)\n2019: \"Blood of the Past\" (The Comet is Coming featuring Kae Tempest)\n2020: \"Time Is Hardcore\" (High Contrast featuring Kae Tempest & Anita Blay)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Wroe, Nicholas (4 October 2014). \"Kate Tempest: 'Rapping changed my life'\".

Meyers (who had been dating for 11 years) talked about being in a polyamorous relationship, a revelation that got them uninvited from their respective families' Thanksgiving dinners.[16]\nTortorella civilly married Meyers on March 9, 2018, at a Manhattan City clerk's office before exchanging vows at St. Paul's Chapel.[17] Tortorella announced that they identify as gender fluid during a video collaboration with drag queen Trinity The Tuck in the same year.[18] Tortorella uses they/them pronouns.[19]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2010\n\nTwelve\n\nTobias\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\nScream 4\n\nTrevor Sheldon\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\nTrespass\n\nJake\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\nOdd Thomas\n\nSimon Varner\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\nHunter&Game\n\nCarson Lowe\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nFluidity\n\nMatt\n\n\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2009\n\nThe Beautiful Life: TBL\n\nCole Shepherd\n\nMain role\n\n\n2009\u20132010\n\nMake It or Break It\n\nRazor\n\nRecurring role\n\n\n2013\n\nThe Following\n\nJacob Wells\n\nMain role (season 1)\n\n\n2015\n\nEye Candy\n\nTommy Calligan\n\nUnaired original pilot\n\n\n2015\u2013present\n\nYounger\n\nJosh\n\nMain role\n\n\n2016\n\nMamma Dallas\n\nJesse\n\nTelevision film\n\n\n2017\n\nMenendez: Blood Brothers\n\nLyle Menendez\n\nTelevision film\n\n\n2018\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race\n\nThemself\n\nEpisode: \"Tap That App\"; also guest judge [20]\n\n\n2018\n\nTrailblazer Honors\n\n\n\nTelevision film\n\n\n2018\u20132019\n\nHow Far Is Tattoo Far?\n\nThemself\n\nHost[21]\n\n\n2019\n\nLindsay Lohan's Beach Club\n\nThemself\n\nGuest\n\n\n2020\n\nRuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race\n\nThemself\n\nCompetitor\n\n\n2020\n\nLegendary\n\nThemself\n\nGuest judge, season 1 episode 4 \u2013 Wild Wild West\n\n\n2020\n\nThe Walking Dead: World Beyond\n\nFelix Carlucci\n\nMain role\n\nMusic videos[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nArtist\n\n\n2013\n\n\"Valentine's for One\"\n\nKissing Man\n\nForklift Comedy\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"@nicotortorella on Instagram: \"just married. for real. @bethanycmeyers and i wrote a very special piece about our wedding and unconditional love exclusively for @them -\u2026\"\".

Alok is gender non-conforming and transfeminine and uses singular they pronouns.[1][2]\nAs a mixed-media artist Alok uses poetry, comedy, performance, drag, lecture, sound-art, fashion design, self-portraiture, and social media to explore themes of gender, race, trauma, belonging, and the human condition.[3] Their artistry responds to violence against trans and gender non-conforming people, calling for freedom from constraining gender norms.[2] They advocate for bodily diversity, gender neutrality, and self-determination.[4][5] Alok has presented creative work in over 40 countries.[6]\nIn 2019 they advocated for the complete degendering of fashion and beauty industries.[7]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Performance\n2.2 Fashion design\n2.3 Public speaking\n2.4 Selected live performances\n2.5 Published writing\n2.6 TV and film appearances\n2.7 Selected podcast appearances\n2.8 Modeling\n2.9 Awards and recognition\n\n\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nVaid-Menon grew up in College Station, Texas as the child of Malayali and Punjabi immigrant parents from Malaysia and India.[8] Growing up they were bullied for their race and gender expression.[9] They felt that they were unable to come out on their own terms because as a visibly gender non-conforming person they didn't know they were different until they were punished for it and told who they were.[10] They developed their art practice at a young age in response to this harassment. \u201cMaking art gave me the permission to live. I needed somewhere to put the pain.\u201d[9] They began to use poetry and style to interrupt other peoples\u2019 assumptions, challenge shame, and declare themself on their own terms.[11] Because they weren't able to express themself visually for fear of safety, they began to share their art online and received supportive responses.[12]\nIn 2019 Alok returned to College Station to host a Pride celebration with local LGBTQ community in honor of the 50th anniversary of Stonewall.[13]\nAfter leaving Texas Alok attended Stanford University where they graduated with a BA in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies[14] and Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity, as well as a Masters in Sociology in 2013.\n\nCareer[edit]\nPerformance[edit]\nAlok's performance style is known for stream of consciousness, soundscapes, political comedy, and emotional range.[15] They remark that their style, like their identity, is in constant flux and refuses easy categorization[10] and believe that performance is one of the only spaces where people can actually be real anymore.[16] In this way, performance is about world-making where the audience can relate to one another with \u201ca commitment to vulnerability, play, interdependence, and magic.[10] For Alok, the power of performance is precisely that it is ephemeral and can never be done again the same way.[17] They also use performance as a mode of pedagogy to teach theories and histories that have been submerged.[18]\nFor Alok, living is a modality of art.[15]\n\n Alok in 2018. Photo by Eivind Hansen.\nThere are several themes that reoccur in Alok\u2019s work. They unpack the dynamics of transmisogyny, reflect on the continued attack on trans and gender non-conforming people, and shift the representation of TGNC people.[19][17] In 2017, Alok released their inaugural book of poetry, FEMME IN PUBLIC, a meditation on harassment against transfeminine people.[20] They toured a show associated with the book across the world, partnering with local trans artists and organizations, to advocate for trans justice.[15] In VICE they write, \u201cthe majority of people still believe that trans is what we look like, and not who we are. We are reduced to the spectacle of our appearance.\u201d[19] Alok advocates for transfeminine people to be regarded in their full personhood: \u201cThere is a long history of trans-femme bodies being reduced to metaphor, to symbol\u2026and seen as stand-ins for ideas, fantasies, and nightmares.\u201d[2] They draw attention to the fact that even though gender non-conforming people are the most visible in public, they remain the most neglected by the mainstream LGBT movement.[4]\nAlok is committed to challenging what they call \u201cthe international crisis of loneliness\u201d[21] by creating public spaces for processing pain and establishing meaningful connection.[22][23]  This work includes re-imagining and deploying technology as a conduit for intimacy.[24] In 2019, Alok completed an artist-in-residence program at The Invisible Dog Art Center, where they performed a piece entitled \"Strangers are Potential Friends\u201d and hosted a \u201cValentine\u2019s Cry-In\u201d to create a space for public grief and explore alternative forms of intimacy and interdependence.[25] Alok facilitates \u201cFeelings Workshops\u201d across the world to develop transformative ways of interacting with ourselves, one another, and as a way of promoting emotional justice and wellness.[26]\nThey challenge Western rationalism and an emphasis on reductive categories and instead insist on the complexity and enormity of everyone and everything.[27] They want to create work and ways of relating to each other that are less about being understood, and more about being felt. They believe that art is one of the places we can come closest to approximating truth. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune they write, \u201cThe problem with a category is that you reduce something as celestial as a human being into a word. Words only approximate truth, and art is where we go when we actually want truth[28]\n\nFashion design[edit]\n Alok Fashion Collection 2018.

He is internationally known as the grooming expert on the Netflix series Queer Eye,[2] for his work on the web series parody Gay of Thrones, and for hosting the Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness podcast.\nVan Ness is non-binary.[3] His preferred gender pronouns are he/him/his,[4] but he has indicated that he is okay being referred to with she/her or they/them as well.[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Writing and Peanut goes for the Gold\n\n\n3 Personal life\n4 Filmography\n\n4.1 Television and web\n4.2 Films\n4.3 Music videos\n4.4 Podcasts\n\n\n5 Awards and honors\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nJonathan Van Ness was born March 28, 1987, and raised in Quincy, Illinois.[1][6] Van Ness said he comes \"from a family of journalists,\" being the sixth generation of their family-owned newspaper.[7] This refers to broadcast and newspaper conglomerate Quincy Media and the company's local flagship newspaper, the Herald-Whig; Van Ness' mother is the vice president of Quincy Media, and he is a descendant of the Oakley family which has controlled the company since the 1890s.[8]\nOpenly gay throughout his life,[9] Van Ness experienced bullying for his \"femininity and natural flamboyance,\" and received death threats.[10] He \"endured years of judgment, ridicule, and trauma.\"[10] Of the time, Van Ness said, \"Growing up I definitely put on every nail polish, every heel, every scarf \u2013 I definitely had my mom's knockoff Herm\u00e8s scarves in my hair and around my waist \u2013 those were my skirts, and I loved it. ... But when I was really young, I had really femme-shamey, gender-shamey [reactions] when I would dress like that. When I would play with those things, I knew it needed to be... behind closed doors.\"[10] Although always comfortable in his own skin, he says it did take some time to navigate other people's reactions.[10] In response to the bullying he used humor as a coping mechanism, and relied on a small group of close friends for support.[11] Years later, in the late 2010s, he realized he was gender non-conforming, and non-binary.[10]\nWhen he was younger, he was sexually abused by an older boy at church, and Van Ness said this laid the foundation for self-destructive behaviors.[12] In his early teens, he used online-chat to socialize with, and sometimes meet older men for sex.[12] He was the first male cheerleader at Quincy Senior High School and continued cheerleading in college at the University of Arizona, where he majored in political science.[9][13] One month in his initial semester at college, he used up his monthly allowance on \ncocaine and, too embarrassed to ask his parents for funds, turned to sex work.[12] His addictions to sex and drugs increased to also include methamphetamine.[12] His grades fell and he lost his cheerleading scholarship. He dropped out after one semester to pursue hairstyling.[11][14]\nVan Ness trained at the Aveda Institute in Minneapolis.[15] After graduating,[16] he worked in Arizona for five years,[17] before moving to Los Angeles, California, in 2009.[9]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn Los Angeles, Van Ness found a job as a personal assistant at Sally Hershberger Salon.[9][16] One day in 2012, he fainted in the salon while doing highlights for a client's hair. Later at a clinic, he found out he was HIV-positive.[12] He used the revelation to \"get clean\" from drug use and publicly shared his story, saying, \"I want people to realize you\u2019re never too broken to be fixed.\"[12] He currently works at MoJoHair and Stile Salon, both in Los Angeles, which he co-founded with Monique Northrop of Arte Salon in New York City.[16]\nMedia\nIn 2013, while dressing the hair of friend Erin Gibson \u2013 who worked for the comedy syndicate Funny or Die[9] \u2013 Van Ness was asked by Gibson to perform his recap of a Game of Thrones episode for Funny or Die, which became the Gay of Thrones web series.[18] Van Ness was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Variety Series in 2018 for Gay of Thrones.[19][20]\nSince 2015, Van Ness has hosted the weekly podcast Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.[21] His podcast took off upon the airing of the first Queer Eye episode.[22]\nVan Ness currently stars as the grooming expert on the Netflix revival of Queer Eye.[23]\n\nWriting and Peanut goes for the Gold[edit]\nIn 2020, Van Ness released a picture book titled Peanut goes for the Gold.[24]  It tells the story of a nonbinary guinea pig named Peanut and their adventures as a rhythmic gymnastics prodigy. Peanut is inspired by Jonathan\u2019s own childhood pet.[25] In an interview for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Van Ness discussed how Peanut didn\u2019t have any other rhythmic gymnasts to look up to so they created a space for themselves as a rhythmic gymnast. He also announced Peanut goes for the Gold would be partnering with No Kid Hungry\u2019s fund #savewithstories, where Van Ness did a virtual reading of Peanut goes for the Gold to support the children affected by the coronavirus pandemic to ensure they have access to meals that would have been provided to them at school.[26]  In a LiveSigning interview, Van Ness explained why he wanted to write Peanut goes for the Gold, saying \u201cI really wanted to do something that would celebrate all those kids that are individual and themselves\u201d, and emphasized the importance of uniqueness and pursuing one's passions.[27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nVan Ness currently works in Los Angeles and New York City.[28] He has psoriasis, a chronic skin condition, and advises clients on skin care.[29]\nIn a 2019 interview with The New York Times, he revealed a history of drug addiction issues, childhood sexual abuse, and his HIV-positive diagnosis at age 25.[8]\nOn September 25, 2019, Van Ness announced his endorsement of Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020 based upon healthcare being a human right.[30]\nHis memoir, Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love,[31]was published in October 2019. His memoir discusses his past and how it helped sculpt his future.\nOn June 23, 2020, Van Ness and Queer Eye costar Bobby Berk praised recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that ruled that LGBT employment discrimination was a violation of the Civil Right Act of 1964.[32] Van Ness described the ruling as \"a great step in the right direction.\"[32] However, both of them still urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act.[32]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nTelevision and web[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2013\u20132019\n\nGay of Thrones\n\nJonathan\n\nSeries regular, 45 episodes\n\n\n2014\n\nI Love the 2000s\n\nHimself\n\nSeries regular, 10 episodes\n\n\n2016\n\nLast Will and Testicle\n\nTesticle\n\nEpisode: \"Acceptance\"\n\n\n2018\u2013present\n\nQueer Eye\n\nHimself\n\nSeries regular, 47 episodes\n\n\n2018\n\nNailed It!\n\nHimself\n\nContestant, Episode: \"3, 2, 1...

Steinberg is the only child of Mark Steinberg, a scholar of Russian history and Professor in the Department of History at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and Jane Hedges, who served as Editor at Yale University Press and Managing Editor of the Slavic Review.[4][5] She is of Russian Jewish descent on her father's side, and identifies strongly with her father's faith.[6]\nSteinberg graduated from University Laboratory High School in Champaign-Urbana in 2004.[7] After high school, she spent time as a part-time security guard at the Russian State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, and interned at the Staatsoper (State Opera) in Berlin, Germany.[8][9]\nSteinberg obtained a BA in Modern Literature from Vassar College in 2009. In 2010, she was a Fulbright Scholar in Moscow and completed a project that aimed to understand the role of different art forms in contemporary Russian society.[10] She received an MFA in cartooning in 2013 from the Center for Cartoon Studies in White River Junction, Vermont.[11] Prior to pursuing drag as a full-time career, Steinberg worked as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator.[12]\n\nCareer[edit]\nDrag and RuPaul's Drag Race[edit]\nVelour tried out for RuPaul's Drag Race's eighth season but was not selected to participate.[13] In 2017, she competed on and ultimately won the ninth season of the show.[14][15] Allison Shoemaker of The A.V. Club named Velour's lip sync to Whitney Houston's \"So Emotional\" in the season finale the best TV performance of 2017.[16] The lip sync was later referenced on Saturday Night Live, during Kate McKinnon's impression of Elizabeth Warren.[17][18] In June 2019, a panel of judges from New York magazine placed Velour 12th on their list of \"the most powerful drag queens in America\", a ranking of 100 former Drag Race contestants.[19]\nFollowing her time on the show, Velour continued to work as a drag queen and expanded into the fashion industry. She selected 40 LGBT models to walk for Opening Ceremony in New York Fashion Week 2018.[20][21][22] She attended Rihanna's fourth annual Diamond Ball in September of that year.[23][24] At the end of 2017, Velour's artwork of German singer-actress Marlene Dietrich was used as a Google Doodle on the performer's 116th birthday on December 27, 2017. Velour had impersonated Dietrich in the Snatch Game challenge on her season of Drag Race.[25] On December 7, 2018, Velour participated in The Long Conversation at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.[26]\nVelour starred in the music video \"C.L.A.T.\" alongside fellow New York City drag queens Peppermint, Aja and Alexis Michelle, all of whom also appeared on the ninth season of Drag Race.[27] Velour's makeup and look transformations have been featured in publications such as Vogue,[28] Cosmopolitan,[29] Vanity Fair,[30] and Billboard.[31]\n\nIllustration and graphic design[edit]\nSteinberg's comics and illustrations have appeared in The Nib, InkBRICK,[32] Comics Workbook Magazine,[33] QU33R,[34] Cicada Magazine[35] and others, under the names Sasha Velour and Sasha Steinberg. Steinberg also created a series of comics entitled \"Stonewall\", which told the story of the Stonewall riots from multiple viewpoints. The series was called \"a smart, beautiful and artful take on a significant and difficult historical event\" by Highlow Comics.[36] A solo gallery show of Steinberg's illustration work, \"Nightrooms\", was held at the Black Box Gallery in Brooklyn in March 2016 and Steinberg's cut paper work was part of the group show \"Coney Island Babies, Visual Artists from the Brooklyn Drag Scene\" at the Bureau of General Services Queer Division that opened in Manhattan in November 2012.[37] In March 2017, Steinberg designed a long sleeve T-shirt for \"Contemporary Drag\", a limited-edition fashion line for the New Art Dealers Alliance's (NADA) in collaboration with Print All Over Me.[38]\n\nVelour, The Drag Magazine[edit]\nSteinberg founded Velour, The Drag Magazine (originally named Vym), a bi-yearly publication about drag, alongside partner Johnny in the summer of 2014.[39] Steinberg serves as the magazine's artistic director. The first issue (\"What is Drag?\") was released June 2015 and the second issue (\"Realness\") was released in October 2016.[40] The magazine includes interviews as well as varied art forms such as photography, poetry, and illustration that address the power, beauty, and purpose of drag.[41]\n\nNightgowns[edit]\nSince August 2015, Steinberg has produced Nightgowns, a monthly drag show in Brooklyn. The events have been regularly hosted at Bizarre Bushwick and National Sawdust. The shows have been celebrated as \"beautiful and funny and politically charged\" by The New York Times.[42] In 2020, Steinberg starred in her own Quibi show, NightGowns, which follows Velour across eight episodes as she transforms Nightgowns into a full-blown stage act.[43]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAs of 2013[update], Steinberg resides in Brooklyn, New York, with partner John Jacob Lee (also known as Johnny Velour) and her pet Italian greyhound, Vanya.[44] Steinberg is genderqueer and does not have any preferred pronouns when not in drag. Her drag persona, Sasha Velour, is referred to as \"she.\"[2][45]\nSteinberg has a shaved head. As Sasha, Steinberg often performs in drag bald as a tribute to her mother, Jane Hedges, who died of cancer in 2015 and had lost her hair during treatment for the disease.[39]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2017\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race\n\nHerself (Contestant)\n\nSeason 9 (Winner)\n\n\n2019\n\nBroad City\n\nHerself\n\nGuest Appearance\n\n\n2019\n\nThe Bold Type\n\nHerself\n\nGuest Appearance\n\nWeb series[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2017\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked\n\nHerself\n\nSeason 9\n\n\n2020\n\nThe Pit Stop[46]\n\nHerself\n\nSeason 12, Episode 1\n\n\n2020\n\nNightGowns\n\nHerself\n\nQuibi original\n\n\n2020\n\nThe X-Change Rate[47]\n\nHerself\n\nGuest\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward Giving Body\n\nCategory\n\nWork\n\nResults\n\nRef.\n\n\n2020\n\nThe Queerties\n\nDrag Royalty\n\nHerself\n\nNominated\n\n[48]\n\nSee also[edit]\nLGBT culture in New York City\nList of LGBT people from New York City\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Mother: Sasha Velour\".

Her father, a physician, and mother, an ex-school teacher, chose to register and raise her as female without subjecting her to medically unnecessary cosmetic genital surgeries, also known as intersex genital mutilation (IGM), that were routinely recommended at the time for intersex children with genital variance like hers.[4]\nViloria attended Wesleyan University in Connecticut from 1986 to 1988, and graduated with high honors and high distinction from the University of California, Berkeley in 1998, with an interdisciplinary studies B.A. in gender and sexuality.\n\nCareer[edit]\nViloria is the author of the acclaimed Born Both: An Intersex Life (Hatchette Book Group, March, 2017),[5] and has been published extensively on intersectional intersex issues such Intersex Genital Mutilation (IGM), its harms, heteronormative imperatives and similarities to FGM, discrimination against intersex women in sports, sexuality, legal gender recognition, and gender identity, in venues such as The Washington Post, The Daily Beast, Huffington Post, The Advocate, Ms., The New York Times, The American Journal of Bioethics, the Global Herald, CNN.com, and more.\nViloria is recognized as a human rights activist who advocates for equality and human rights for intersex and non-binary people, as president elect of the Organisation Intersex International from 2011 to 2017, and as founding director of the Intersex Campaign for Equality.\nViloria educates extensively about intersex and non-binary gender issues as a frequent speaker (Columbia, Stanford, Princeton, Vassar, NYU), consultant (United Nations OHCHR, United Nations Free & Equal Campaign, Lambda Legal, Human Rights Watch, Williams Institute, IOC...), \ntelevision and radio guest (The Oprah Winfrey Show, HuffPost Live, 20/20, Aljazeera, BBC Radio, KPFA) \nand in film (Gendernauts, One in 2000, Intersexion, The General Was Female?\"\".\n\nOpposing nonconsensual medically-unnecessary surgeries[edit]\nIn 1996, Viloria participated in the first international intersex retreat. She reports that, eager to meet people like herself, instead she \"met people who'd been traumatized and physically damaged by cosmetic genital surgeries and hormone treatments they'd been subjected to in infancy and childhood, and it moved me to become an intersex activist.\"[6][7]\nViloria has been advocating publicly against the use of medically unnecessary cosmetic surgeries and hormone therapy on intersex infants and minors, aka Intersex Genital Mutilation,  since 1997,[8] reaching audiences of over one hundred million, via appearances in various documentaries about intersex people, including the first, Hermaphrodites Speak!, and most notably on ABC's 20/20,[9] The Oprah Winfrey Show,[10] in Spanish on the Emmy nominated Spanish language show Caso Cerrado,[11] and at the UN Headquarters in New York City for Human Rights Day 2013.\nIn 2004, Viloria testified before the San Francisco Human Rights Commission in 2004, on the need to ban medically unnecessary cosmetic genital surgeries on intersex infants and children.[12]\nBetween 2010 and 2017 Viloria published numerous essays speaking out against nonconsensual medically unnecessary surgeries, also known as intersex genital mutilation, in publications including CNN.com, The Advocate, The Huffingtion Post, and the Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics. Her memoir Born Both: An Intersex Life, published March 14, 2017, by Hachette Books, examines and critiques intersex genital mutilation extensively.\n\nOpposing \"disorders of sex development\"[edit]\nIn 2006, the international medical establishment replaced the terms \"hermaphrodite\" and \"intersex\" with the term \"disorders of sex development\". Viloria is among a handful of American intersex activists[citation needed] who opposed the use of the term \"Disorders of Sex Development\" since its introduction. In 2007, she publicly critiqued the label and the homophobic and transphobic reasoning behind the replacement of 'intersex' with DSD.[13]  S/he also argued that being raised to define oneself as disordered is psychologically harmful to intersex youth:\n\nWhile some doctors and parents are, according to supporters of the term like Chase (co-author of the DSD Guidelines and founder and director of ISNA), more comfortable referring to us as having \"disorders\" than associating with a label supported by homosexuals and transsexuals, I do not believe adopting a pathologizing label to distance ourselves from these groups is a solution, to say the least....  I know that it would have harmed my self-esteem to be raised under a term which named my difference a 'disorder.' Even complete ignorance about what to call myself was preferable as I was able to form positive beliefs about my unique qualities.\u2014\u2009Hida Viloria[14]\nAddressing discrimination against intersex women in sports[edit]\nIn 2009, in response to the treatment of black South African track star Caster Semenya, who was rumored to be intersex, Viloria lobbied as an independent intersex activist for equal rights for intersex female athletes on television[15] and in print on CNN.com.[16] In February 2010, then as Human Rights Spokesperson of the Organisation Intersex International (OII), s/he authored a petition to the International Olympic Committee demanding that intersex women athletes to be allowed to compete as is, and be de-pathologized.[17] The action resulted in Viloria being invited to participate in the International Olympic Committee's October 2010 meeting of experts on intersex women in sports, in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she lobbied against adopting regulations which require intersex female athletes to undergo medically unnecessary medical procedures in order to compete as women, and against athletes being referred to as individuals with \"disorders of sex development\".[7]  As a result of Viloria's advocacy, the IOC and IAAF discontinued its use of \"disorders of sex development\" to describe the athletes in question, and replaced it with \"women with hyperandrogenism\".[7]\nViloria has argued since 2009 that Olympic sex testing is applied in a way that targets 'butch,' or masculine-looking, women.[18][19] In 2012, Viloria co-authored an article in the American Journal of Bioethics, with intersex Spanish hurdler Maria Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez-Pati\u00f1o, the athlete responsible for overturning the IOC's long-standing mandatory chromosome testing policies, which critiqued the IOC's proposed regulations for women with high levels of naturally occurring testosterone (aka hyperandrogenism).[20]  Upon the release of the I.O.C.'s final regulations for intersex women with hyperandrogenism in 2012, s/he collaborated on an opinion piece with scholar Georgiann Davis[21] and also told The New York Times that the issues for intersex athletes remain unresolved: \"Many athletes have medical differences that give them a competitive edge but are not asked to have medical interventions to 'remove' the advantage.... The real issue is not fairness, but that certain athletes are not accepted as real women because of their appearance.\"[22]\nOn Human Rights Day, 2013, Viloria became the first openly intersex person to speak at the U.N., by invitation, at the event \"Sport Comes Out Against Homophobia\", along with fellow \"out\" pioneers, tennis legend Martina Navratilova, and NBA player Jason Collins.[23][24]\nIn 2014, Viloria advocated against the IOC and IAAF's regulations for women with hyperandrogenism on a panel on the Aljazeera television show The Stream.[25]  She also wrote about the interphobia and common misunderstandings around naturally occurring testosterone which drive sporting regulations for intersex women, in The Advocate.[26]\n\nBirth registrations[edit]\nWith the advent of a new German law assigning visibly intersex infants to an 'indeterminate' gender, Viloria has argued that this approach to birth registrations fails to provide adequate human rights for intersex people, and fails to address the most critical need: for an end to normalizing surgical and hormonal interventions on infants and children.[27][28]\nIn April, 2017, Viloria became the second American recipient of an intersex birth certificate, issued by the city of New York.[29]\n\nNational and global affiliations and activism[edit]\nIn spring 2010, Viloria joined the Organisation Intersex International, or OII, the first international intersex organization, was appointed Human Rights Spokesperson, and began lobbying against discriminatory regulations for intersex women athletes. In Spring 2011, Viloria was voted Chairperson of OII, upon founder Curtis Hinkle's retirement. Viloria stepped down in November 2017, when Intersex Campaign for Equality left OII.[30]\nIn the fall of 2011, Viloria founded the Intersex Campaign for Equality, to work for equality and human rights for intersex Americans. Her first action, in December, 2011, was contacting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to request inclusion of intersex people in human rights protocols and protections. In early 2012 she received a response from the U.S. Department of State in early 2012 affirming the importance of including the intersex community in human rights work.[31]\nIn 2012, Viloria spearheaded the first unified, global call for human rights by and for intersex people, in a letter signed by thirty leading intersex advocacy organizations, to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.[32]\nIn 2013, Viloria served as one of three intersex co-organizers of the Third International Intersex Forum in November 2013, in Malta, which led to the creation of the Malta declaration, the most widely agreed upon statement of human rights' demands by the international intersex advocacy community.[33]\nIn 2016, Viloria became a board member of Genital Autonomy America (GA America), an advocacy organization working with groups worldwide who are seeking to end non-therapeutic genital cutting of all female, male, and intersex infants and children.\n\nMedia[edit]\nViloria spoke about being non-binary, also known as genderqueer, in the groundbreaking, award-winning 1999 documentary Gendernauts.[34]\nIn 2002, Viloria spoke about feeling blessed s/he did not experience forced infant genital surgeries on 20/20 (American TV program).\nIn 2007, on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Viloria likened society's lack of understanding of non-binary people, and the pressure non-binary people experience to identify as men or women,  to what people of mixed African-American and caucasian race sometimes experience, saying, \"Society pressures you to choose sides, just like they pressure mixed race people to decide, you know... 'Are you really black? Are you really white?'\" Viloria went on to say \"I have both [sides].\".[10]\nIn September 2015, the UN's Free & Equal Campaign for Equality produced a video of Viloria[35] in conjunction with the release of their groundbreaking resource the Intersex Fact Sheet,[36] and in 2016 Viloria was one of the \"Intersex Voices\" featured in the Free and Equal Campaign for Equality's Intersex Awareness Campaign.[37]\nViloria has also advocated against Intersex Genital Mutilation via essays,[38][39][16] and in he/r 2017 memoir, Born Both: An Intersex LIfe.[5]\nIn 2019 Viloria was featured in the Smithsonian Channel documentary, The General Was Female?, which explores compelling evidence that General Casimir Pulaski, revered as the father of the American Cavalry, may have been intersex.\n\nSelected bibliography[edit]\nViloria, Hida (May 3, 2019). \"Stop trying to make Caster Semenya fit a narrow idea of womanhood.

I would wear strictly vintage dresses, which came in handy because my mom, as a costume designer, has a cedar closet in our basement full of vintage dresses\".[3]\nGeggie attended Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, and majored in art.[8] In 2017, they were awarded the David S. Monroe Art Award, which honors \"outstanding achievement in art, recognizing students for their major, excellence in their work and exhibiting a professional attitude\".[9]\nAfter the family moved from Chicago to Los Angeles, Geggie wanted to become an influencer and started an Instagram profile as a \"beauty boy in make-up\" but found they hated the influencer culture and changed to drag.[10]\n\nCareer[edit]\nGigi Goode was the youngest contestant of the twelfth season of the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race.[11] Gigi Goode and her mother collaborated on many of the outfits she wore on the show.[4] She won the main challenges in episodes 4, 6, 7 (\"Madonna: The Unauthorized Rusical\"), and 12.[12] She impersonated Maria the Robot, a character based on the experimental humanoid robot Sophia,[13][14] during Snatch Game.[15] Jezebel called the portrayal \"physical comedy gold\" and \"incredibly witty\".[16] Entertainment Tonight's John Boone\u200d considered Gigi Goode a front-runner of the show, noting she stumbled for the first time in episode nine.[17] Dylan B. Jones of The Guardian considered her \"undeniably the most cut-glass fashion queen of the season\".[18] Gigi Goode made the top three but lost to Jaida Essence Hall.[19] Jessica Bumpus of Harper's Bazaar described her as a \"superstar\" and a \"breakout star\" after the season aired.[10]\nGigi Goode was the only contestant from season 12 to participate in Werq the World Battle Royale, a live-streamed fundraiser that was held during the COVID-19 pandemic and was called the \"largest drag show on the planet\" and.[20] In mid-2020, she was one of a dozen former Drag Race contestants who were cast in the Drive 'N Drag concert series, which was held at outdoor drive-in venues because of the pandemic.[21] She and other season 12 contestants were due to appear in Bring Back My Ghouls, a Halloween variety special airing on World of Wonder's YouTube channel and WOW Presents Plus in late October 2020.[22]\nGigi Goode appears in the music video for Chester Lockhart's 2018 cover version of \"I Put a Spell on You\".[23] In 2020, she and fellow Drag Race contestant Valentina appeared in the music video for \"I'm Ready\" by Sam Smith and Demi Lovato.[24] Gigi Goode and fellow Drag Race contestants Jaida Essence Hall and Shea Coule\u00e9 participated in Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 2, a fashion show to promote Rihanna's lingerie brand Savage X Fenty that was streamed on Prime Video in 2020.[25]\nIn 2020, Gigi Goode won the \"Outstanding Twitter (Beauty/Fashion)\" category of the WOWIE Awards, which are presented by World of Wonder.[26] She won a People's Choice Award in the \"Competition Contestant of 2020\" category at the 46th People's Choice Awards.[27]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGeggie identifies as genderfluid.[6][15][28] They were living with the Los Angeles-based House of Avalon, which was described by Vogue's Liam Hess as a \"troupe of queer creatives\", as of April 2020.[1] Gigi Goode had approximately 1,000,000 followers on Instagram, as of May 2020.[29] They have been criticized for some of their comments and posts on social media; in 2020, they posted an \"insensitive\" and \"tone deaf\" shaved-head joke about Britney Spears and were criticized for tweeting \"I cannot breathe\" about their anticipation for the Drag Race finale following the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed.[30][31][32]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nTelevision[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n2020\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n\nHerself\n\nRunner-up\n\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked\n\nHerself\n\nContestant\n\n\nSavage X Fenty Show Vol. 2\n\nHerself\n\n\n\nWeb series[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRef\n\n\n2020\n\nWhatcha Packin'\n\n[33]\n\nMusic videos[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nArtist\n\n\n2018\n\n\"I Put a Spell on You\"\n\nChester Lockhart\n\n\n\"Born to Bleed\"[34]\n\nDisasterina\n\n\n2020\n\n\"I'm Ready\"\n\nSam Smith and Demi Lovato\n\nDiscography[edit]\nFeatured singles[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nAlbum\n\nRef\n\n\n\"I'm That Bitch\"(with the cast of RuPaul's Drag Race season 12)\n\n2020\n\nNon-album singles\n\n[35]\n\n\n\"Madonna: The Unauthorized Rusical\"(with the cast of RuPaul's Drag Race season 12)\n\n[36]\n\n\n\"I Made It/Mirror Song/Losing Is the New Winning\" (Las Vegas Live Medley)(with the cast of RuPaul's Drag Race season 12)\n\n[37]\n\n\n\"The Shady Bunch\"(with the cast of RuPaul's Drag Race season 12)\n\n[38]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nAward Giving Body\n\nCategory\n\nResults\n\nRef\n\n\n2020\n\nWOWIE Awards\n\nOutstanding Twitter (Beauty/Fashion)\n\nWon\n\n[26]\n\n\n2020\n\nPeople's Choice Awards\n\nThe Competition Contestant of 2020\n\nWon\n\n[27]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of people with non-binary gender identities\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c Hess, Liam (April 24, 2020). \"Why RuPaul's Drag Race's Gigi Goode Is More Than Just a Fashion Queen\".

Straus Jr. and Agnes \"Aggie\" Mullaney. Her parents divorced while she was young. On her mother's side she is of Irish, Italian, and Polish descent. On her father's side, her great-great-grandparents include Isidor Straus, a U.S. Congressman, and co-owner of Macy's, and Ida Straus; they were from German Jewish families, who immigrated to the United States from the Kingdom of Bavaria and Rhineland-Palatinate. The couple died in the sinking of the passenger ship RMS Titanic.[6][7][8] However she is not an heiress and did not inherit any fortune, telling Rolling Stone, \"I didn\u2019t inherit any of this money.\"[9] She has also clarified this information on her social media platforms.\nStraus spent much of her childhood following her father to work at his recording studio, Mission Sound. There, she learned several instruments, including bass, guitar, piano, and drums, as well as music-production techniques and insight into the music industry. Straus's inspiration in those years had come from the rock music of the bands Led Zeppelin and T. Rex, as well as Jack White.[3] She attended high school at Avenues: The World School, a private school in Manhattan, and played volleyball.[10][11]\nAfter high school, Straus moved to Los Angeles to study at the USC Thornton School of Music. However, after a year, she dropped out in favor of her music career.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\n King Princess performing at Royale in Boston, Massachusetts (2018).\nA music label offered to sign Straus at the age of 11, but she refused to do so. Straus refused because of her experience watching other artists work with a music label in her father's studio. The labels would control the artist's product, and change the feel of the music. She did not want to sign with a record label until she had a definition of her music, how she wanted to run the production, and with whom she would work.[12]\nIn February 2018, King Princess released her debut single \"1950\".[4][13] \"1950\" is a tribute to the 1952 novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith, to the LGBT community and to queer love. The song reached a wide audience when British singer Harry Styles tweeted a lyric from the song.[3] Straus followed this with her second single \"Talia\" in April.[14] She released her debut extended play Make My Bed on June 15, 2018.[15] Later that year, she earned Breakout Pop Artist of the Year honors from Vivid Seats.[16]\nIn 2019, it was announced that King Princess would perform at Lollapalooza[17] and Coachella.[18] She played The Park stage at the 2019 Glastonbury Festival and was joined by Mark Ronson (dressed as King Princess) for a performance of their collaboration \"Pieces of Us\" from his 2019 album Late Night Feelings.[19] Zelig Recordings released King Princess's debut album Cheap Queen on October 25, 2019.[20] She produced much of the album herself, including programming many of the instruments.[21] In November 2019, King Princess was announced to be the opening act for the European leg of Harry Styles' planned 2020 concert tour, Love On Tour.[22] King Princess performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live (Season 45, Episode 7) on November 23, 2019.[23] She released a deluxe edition of Cheap Queen on February 14, 2020. The release included five previously unreleased new songs, including \"Ohio\".[24]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nStraus is gay and genderqueer.[25][26][27][28][29] From early 2018 to late 2018, Straus dated actress Amandla Stenberg. Since early 2019, Straus has been dating Quinn Whitney Wilson, the creative director of musician Lizzo.[30] Regarding her gender identity, she has said in an interview with W Magazine, \"I like being a woman sometimes. I would say 49 percent of the time I love my titties. But I\u2019m not fully a woman. I\u2019m somebody who falls center on the gender spectrum, and it changes day to day. It\u2019s just not in me to decide.\"[31] As of late 2020, King Princess prefers to use she/her pronouns.[32]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nStudio albums[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nDetails\n\nPeak chart positions\n\n\nUSCurrent[33]\n\nUSHeat[34]\n\nUSAlt[35]\n\nAUS[36]\n\nUKPhysical[37]\n\n\nCheap Queen\n\n\nReleased: October 25, 2019\nLabel: Zelig, Columbia\nFormats: CD, digital download, streaming, vinyl\n\n88\n8\n18\n41\n86\n\nExtended plays[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nEP details\n\nPeak chart positions\n\n\nNZHeat.[38]\n\n\nMake My Bed\n\n\nReleased: June 15, 2018[15]\nLabel: Zelig\nFormat: digital download, streaming\n\n1\n\n\nUp Next Live from Apple Williamsburg\n\n\nReleased: August 5, 2019[39]\nLabel: Zelig\nFormat: digital download, streaming\n\n\u2014\n\nSingles[edit]\nAs lead artist[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nPeak chart positions\n\nCertifications\n\nAlbum\n\n\nUSAlt.Airplay[40]\n\nAUS[41]\n\nAUT[42]\n\nBEL(FL)[43]\n\nCAN[44]\n\nNLD[45]\n\nNZHot[46]\n\nSWE[47]\n\nSWI[48]\n\n\n\"1950\"\n\n2018\n\n17\n25\n75\n48\n82\n83\n\u2014\n87\n94\n\n\nRIAA: Platinum[49]\nBPI: Silver[50]\nMC: Gold[51]\nARIA: 2\u00d7 Platinum[52]\n\nMake My Bed\n\n\n\"Talia\"[53]\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\nARIA: Gold[54]\n\n\n\"Pussy Is God\"[55]\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n17\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\nNon-album single\n\n\n\"Femme Fatale\" (RISE Recording)\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\"I Know\" (RISE Recording)(featuring Fiona Apple)\n\n2019\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\"Cheap Queen\"[56]\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n98\n\u2014\n\u2014\n17\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\nCheap Queen\n\n\n\"Prophet\"[57]\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n17\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\"Ain't Together\"[58]\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\"Happy Together\" (with Mark Ronson)\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\nNon-album single\n\n\n\"Hit the Back\"[59]\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\nCheap Queen\n\n\n\"Ohio\"[60]\n\n2020\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\"Only Time Makes It Human\"[61]\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n33\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\nTBA\n\n\n\"Monster\"[62](from Adventure Time: Distant Lands - Obsidian)\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\nNon-album single\n\n\n\"Pain\"[63]\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\n\nTBA\n\n\n\"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nAs featured artist[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nPeak chart position\n\nAlbum\n\n\nNZHot[64]\n\n\n\"Pieces of Us\"[65](Mark Ronson featuring King Princess)\n\n2019\n\n24\n\nLate Night Feelings\n\nGuest appearances[edit]\n\n\nTitle\n\nYear\n\nOther artists\n\nAlbum\n\n\n\"Run Me Through\" (King Princess Remix)[66]\n\n2018\n\nPerfume Genius\n\nReshaped EP\n\n\n\"Fell in Love with a Girl\"[67]\n\n2019\n\nN/A\n\nTriple J Like a Version 15\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\nIn June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, Queerty named her among the fifty heroes \u201cleading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people\u201d.[68][69]\n\n\n\nYear\n\nOrganization\n\nAward\n\nWork\n\nResult\n\n\n2018\n\nBBC\n\nSound of 2019\n\nHerself\n\nSecond[70]\n\n\nDIY\n\nClass of 2019\n\nIncluded[71]\n\n\n2019\n\nRolling Stone Germany'sInternational Music Award\n\nBeginner\n\nPending[72]\n\n\n2020\n\nGLAAD Media Award\n\nOutstanding Music Artist\n\nCheap Queen\n\nPending[73]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Murphy, Lauren (October 21, 2019). \"'As per usual, we\u2019re in a drought of good music': Rising star Mikaela Straus, aka King Princess, has got the songs, connections and attitude for pop-star life\".

(March 2020)\n Victoria Sin in 2018 at Live Art Bistro, Leeds\nVictoria Sin (born 1991) is a Canadian visual artist[1] who uses \"speculative fiction within drag performance, moving image, writing and print to refigure attitudes towards gender, sexuality and historical discourses of identity.\"[2] They are known for their immersive performance art and drag artistry, a practice which they use to \"interrupt normative processes of desire, identification, and objectification.\" [1]\nSin's drag aesthetic references range from Jessica Rabbit to Marilyn Monroe.[3] Their drag serves to destabilise essentialist and binary notions of gender by illustrating its performative nature.[3] Further, in their own words, their drag practice is a mechanism of \"exercising entitlement\" and taking up space in predominantly white, male spaces.[4]\nSin's visual art practice surfaces and critiques the labour of performing femininity, Western beauty standards and \"identification with gendered and raced imagery and the ways it is inscribed and performed on bodies.\"[4] These themes emerge in Sin's series of used makeup wipes which act as a \"relic of the performance, or the labour that was done that evening.\"[5]\nSin is also known for investigating speculative fiction as a medium to surface and platform intersectional queer experience, most notably in their project Dream Babes, an ongoing series of events, performances and publications.[6] They are particularly interested storytelling as a collective way of narrating the marginalised experience, and in the use of \"science fiction as a way of visualizing alternative narratives and social structures to those in our own social context.\"[2]\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, Sin moved to London in 2009.[3] They studied a BA in Drawing at Camberwell College of Arts before obtaining an MA in Print at The Royal College of Art in 2017.[7] Sin first became interested in drag at age 17 when they would visit gay bars and drag nights with their friends.[5] Shortly after moving to London in 2009, Sin became involved in the queer creative scene, running club nights with friends and beginning to experiment with drag.[5] It was through \"a process of doing drag and purposefully putting on a gender and then taking it off again\" that Sin came to realise they are non-binary.[8]\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 2020, Sin co-wrote and performed as a vocalist on \"The Th1ng\", a single from Yaeji taken from the album 'WHAT WE DREW \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uadf8\ub824\uc654\ub358'.\nIn 2019, Sin performed their pieces A View From Elsewhere and If I had the words to tell you we wouldn\u2019t be here now as part of the 58th Venice Bienniale.[9][10] Sin also featured in Hayward Gallery's Kiss My Genders, an exhibition comprising work by 'more than 30 international artists whose work explores and engages with gender identity.'[11]\nIn 2018, Sin performed as part of the Serpentine Pavilion Park Nights Programme. The performance, titled The sky as an image, an image as a net, was described as \"a ballad of embodiment, longing and transformation, using poetry, drag, science fiction and an original soundtrack by Shy One.\"[12] Sin has also recently performed and exhibited at Hayward Gallery,[13] Sotheby's S|2,[2] Taipei Contemporary Art Centre,[14] Whitechapel Gallery,[15][16][17] Institute of Contemporary Arts[18] and RISD Museum.[19] Their work was included in the exhibition Age of You, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Toronto in 2019.[20]\nIn 2017, Sin was awarded the Young Contemporary Talent Prize by The Ingram Collection.[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"Studio Artists | Gasworks\". www.gasworks.org.uk.
